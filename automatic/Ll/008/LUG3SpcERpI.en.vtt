00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
simple a 3d printer can be if you guys

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.670 
simple a 3d printer can be if you guys
are<00:00:21.600> interested<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.170> trying<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.439> make<00:00:22.529> your

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
are interested in trying to make your

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.060 
are interested in trying to make your
own<00:00:22.830> maybe<00:00:23.220> bigger<00:00:23.550> ones<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.119> such<00:00:24.740> now<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
own maybe bigger ones or such now so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
own maybe bigger ones or such now so
basically<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.730> works<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.630> our

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
basically how it works is we have our

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.470 
basically how it works is we have our
little<00:00:28.050> petrol<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.760> thing<00:00:29.970> will

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
little petrol here and this thing will

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
little petrol here and this thing will
go<00:00:30.660> through<00:00:31.019> our<00:00:31.289> cube<00:00:31.619> which<00:00:31.920> sells<00:00:32.160> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
go through our cube which sells this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.549 
go through our cube which sells this
building<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.200> would<00:00:34.200> hear<00:00:35.059> out<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> wood<00:00:36.390> here

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
building I would hear out of wood here

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.270 
building I would hear out of wood here
just<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> prefix<00:00:38.960> explanation<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
just to do a prefix explanation and so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
just to do a prefix explanation and so
basically<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> thing<00:00:45.390> we'll<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
basically what the thing we'll do is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
basically what the thing we'll do is
this<00:00:46.230> thing<00:00:46.440> will<00:00:46.770> print<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> row<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.399> save

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
this thing will print a row out save

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.750 
this thing will print a row out save
well<00:00:48.390> we'll<00:00:48.690> glass<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> press<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> up

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
well we'll glass like that press it up

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
well we'll glass like that press it up
once<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.360> three<00:00:51.629> rows<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.320> push<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
once we get three rows it will push it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.209 
once we get three rows it will push it
forward<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.030> will<00:00:54.120> build<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:55.219> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
forward so it will build it from this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.130 
forward so it will build it from this
corner<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.850> first<00:00:57.120> block<00:00:57.270> placed<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.870> gets

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
corner is the first block placed it gets

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.209 
corner is the first block placed it gets
pressed<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.500> by<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:58.980> press<00:00:59.100> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
pressed up by this one can press that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
pressed up by this one can press that
buy<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.520> shift<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.059> over<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
buy this one shift it over this one this

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080 
buy this one shift it over this one this
one<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.680> pressed<00:01:02.190> over<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.940> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
one this one pressed over this one this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.660 
one this one pressed over this one this
one<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.449> pressed<00:01:04.290> /<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.580> just

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
one this one pressed / so that's just

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.609 
one this one pressed / so that's just
basically<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.600> quick<00:01:06.810> concept<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> how<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
basically the quick concept of how this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.560 
basically the quick concept of how this
works<00:01:08.130> let's<00:01:08.400> remove<00:01:08.939> these<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
works let's remove these two so it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
works let's remove these two so it
doesn't<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.080> our<00:01:10.320> printer<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
doesn't get in the way our printer you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.350 
doesn't get in the way our printer you
know<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.820> pushing<00:01:12.090> nicely<00:01:12.390> over<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> how

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
know just pushing nicely over so how

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.530 
know just pushing nicely over so how
this<00:01:15.540> works<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.950> our<00:01:17.460> clock<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.299> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
this works is on our clock here it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.070 
this works is on our clock here it's
running<00:01:18.810> along<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.159> enable<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.790> row<00:01:21.080> which

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
running along it will enable a row which

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.760 
running along it will enable a row which
a<00:01:22.500> torch<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:23.070> represent<00:01:23.430> i<00:01:24.350> believe<00:01:25.350> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
a torch will represent i believe is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
a torch will represent i believe is
glass<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.759> could<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.840> wrong<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.140> classes<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
while so I'm not exactly remembering

these<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.380> through<00:01:31.650> control<00:01:32.070> these<00:01:32.189> three

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
these go through control these three

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.319 
these go through control these three
control<00:01:32.939> lines<00:01:33.180> OOP<00:01:33.750> yep<00:01:34.380> there<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.329> troll

these three control lines which go

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.510 
these three control lines which go
either<00:01:38.700> direction<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:41.060> depending<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.360> what

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
either direction and depending on what

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
either direction and depending on what
every<00:01:44.520> clock<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.240> enable<00:01:45.509> both<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.110> these

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
every clock it will enable both of these

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.219 
every clock it will enable both of these
and<00:01:47.030> some<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.270> powered<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.960> won't

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and some will be powered some won't

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
and some will be powered some won't
depending<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:50.009> torches<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
depending on these torches like this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.020 
depending on these torches like this
torch<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.720> goes<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:54.000> will

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
torch is here goes up it will be it will

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
torch is here goes up it will be it will
be<00:01:54.149> unpowered<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> center<00:01:55.320> line<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.770> these

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
be unpowered in the center line so these

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950 
be unpowered in the center line so these
two<00:01:56.070> outer<00:01:56.280> lines<00:01:56.520> will<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.729> powered<00:01:57.149> which

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
two outer lines will be powered which

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.760 
two outer lines will be powered which
means<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.229> signal<00:01:58.909> yeah<00:01:59.909> bit<00:02:00.869> mason<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> v8<00:02:01.590> will

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
means a signal yeah bit mason a v8 will

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.249 
means a signal yeah bit mason a v8 will
be<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.939> way<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:03.750> turn<00:02:04.020> off

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
be going this way so when these turn off

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.370 
be going this way so when these turn off
to<00:02:04.590> allow<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> through<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.759> will<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:05.969> off

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
to allow it through this one will be off

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.740 
to allow it through this one will be off
which<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.890> power<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> center<00:02:08.970> piston<00:02:09.360> on

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
which will power the center piston on

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.590 
which will power the center piston on
this<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> glass<00:02:10.560> side

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
this on the glass side

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.590 
this on the glass side
so<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.860> cut<00:02:13.070> lines<00:02:13.280> off<00:02:13.610> line<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.360> turns

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
so this cut lines off line this turns

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.240 
so this cut lines off line this turns
that<00:02:14.810> repeater<00:02:15.080> off<00:02:15.290> turns<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.740> torch<00:02:16.070> on

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
that repeater off turns this torch on

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.150 
that repeater off turns this torch on
presses<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> glass<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.740> other<00:02:18.860> side

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
presses a glass in on the other side

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.370 
presses a glass in on the other side
there<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.270> simple<00:02:20.630> inverter<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
there is just a simple inverter in the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.200 
there is just a simple inverter in the
way<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.950> exact<00:02:22.280> opposite<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.820> what<00:02:22.910> occurs

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
way so the exact opposite of what occurs

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.050 
way so the exact opposite of what occurs
on<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.510> side<00:02:23.750> occurs<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.530> side

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
on that side occurs on this side

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.940 
on that side occurs on this side

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
out or two spaces rest is just the bunch

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.170 
out or two spaces rest is just the bunch

just<00:02:40.220> appalled<00:02:40.460> some<00:02:40.670> right<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.300> don't<00:02:42.080> have

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
just appalled some right so don't have

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.980 
just appalled some right so don't have
the<00:02:42.320> deal<00:02:42.470> too<00:02:42.620> much<00:02:42.740> with<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> clock<00:02:43.250> and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
the deal too much with the clock and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.690 
the deal too much with the clock and
every<00:02:44.990> third<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.740> have<00:02:45.980> an<00:02:46.220> extra<00:02:46.430> torch

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
every third one we have an extra torch

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.070 
every third one we have an extra torch
here<00:02:47.030> which<00:02:47.360> sends<00:02:47.990> line<00:02:48.740> up<00:02:49.510> timed<00:02:50.510> right<00:02:50.810> to

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
here which sends line up timed right to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.350 
here which sends line up timed right to
go<00:02:51.410> after<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.920> block<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.220> pushed<00:02:52.520> up<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.910> push

go after this block is pushed up to push
all<00:02:53.600> through<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.560> three<00:02:54.770> by<00:02:54.950> three<00:02:55.220> over<00:02:55.460> one

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
all through the three by three over one

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.990 
all through the three by three over one
that's<00:02:57.920> just<00:02:58.160> a<00:02:58.220> simple<00:02:58.720> misted<00:02:59.720> wall<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:01.000> arc

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
that's just a simple misted wall and arc

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.420 
that's just a simple misted wall and arc
we<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.570> our<00:03:02.750> clock<00:03:03.740> which<00:03:03.950> basically<00:03:04.310> just

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
we have our clock which basically just

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.360 
we have our clock which basically just
goes<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:05.090> back<00:03:05.600> back<00:03:06.200> for<00:03:06.740> it<00:03:06.830> goes<00:03:06.980> back<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
goes that back back for it goes back and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.170 
goes that back back for it goes back and
forth<00:03:07.430> toggle<00:03:08.240> each<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.540> these<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.870> sequence

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
forth toggle each of these in sequence

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.880 
forth toggle each of these in sequence
at<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> right<00:03:11.900> timing<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:12.680> thing

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
at just the right timing so this thing

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.130 
at just the right timing so this thing
to<00:03:12.980> work<00:03:13.010> about<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.790> think<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.210> died<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.540> ideal

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
to work about I think I died the ideal

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.700 
to work about I think I died the ideal
speed<00:03:15.790> we<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:16.940> our<00:03:17.150> repeaters<00:03:17.810> all<00:03:18.020> timed<00:03:18.290> a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
speed we have our repeaters all timed a

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.150 
speed we have our repeaters all timed a
little<00:03:19.010> bit<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.160> timing<00:03:19.520> in<00:03:19.640> here<00:03:19.910> I<00:03:21.040> bought<00:03:22.040> be

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
little bit of timing in here I bought be

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.130 
little bit of timing in here I bought be

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
you might be able to time this and make

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.130 
you might be able to time this and make
it<00:04:00.110> even<00:04:00.410> faster<00:04:00.530> but<00:04:01.360> right<00:04:02.360> now<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.540> can<00:04:02.990> see

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
it even faster but right now you can see

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.810 
it even faster but right now you can see
we<00:04:03.230> have<00:04:03.260> loaded<00:04:03.650> up<00:04:03.830> like<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.010> check<00:04:04.340> 3d

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
we have loaded up like a check 3d

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.540 
we have loaded up like a check 3d
checkerboard<00:04:05.300> type<00:04:05.450> pattern<00:04:05.690> right<00:04:05.990> now<00:04:06.550> so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
checkerboard type pattern right now so

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.910 
checkerboard type pattern right now so
this<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.850> first<00:04:08.060> row<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:09.500> top<00:04:09.680> right

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
this is the first row the top right

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.280 
this is the first row the top right
there'll<00:04:10.880> be<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.120> top<00:04:11.390> corner<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:12.050> row

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
there'll be this top corner that row

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.170 
there'll be this top corner that row
that<00:04:12.530> row<00:04:12.740> that<00:04:13.280> one<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.610> would<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.880> wasn't

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
that row that one that would that wasn't

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.730 
that row that one that would that wasn't
that<00:04:14.300> without<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.780> one<00:04:14.930> as<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.410> lay<00:04:15.590> it

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
that without and that one as you lay it

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.260 
that without and that one as you lay it
down<00:04:15.890> so<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.400> design<00:04:16.700> whatever<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.090> want

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
down so you can design whatever you want

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.560 
down so you can design whatever you want
so<00:04:17.930> without<00:04:18.650> further<00:04:18.710> ado<00:04:19.160> let's<00:04:19.760> print<00:04:20.330> this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
so without further ado let's print this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.450 
so without further ado let's print this
so<00:04:21.260> we<00:04:21.380> can<00:04:21.410> hit<00:04:21.620> our<00:04:21.770> print<00:04:22.010> button

em<00:05:06.240> we'll<00:05:06.540> do<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> quick<00:05:06.870> print<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.200> something

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
em we'll do a quick print of something

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.500 
em we'll do a quick print of something

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
else so you can learn how to set this so

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:22.790 
else so you can learn how to set this so
we<00:05:13.050> will<00:05:13.200> here<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:17.030> let's<00:05:18.030> fill<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.830> see<00:05:21.800> it

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
we will here and let's fill a see it

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.360 
we will here and let's fill a see it
will<00:05:23.040> build<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.490> just<00:05:24.389> in<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.540> center<00:05:24.810> row

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
will build it just in the center row

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.300 
will build it just in the center row
actual<00:05:26.370> bill<00:05:26.520> to<00:05:26.610> see<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.030> an<00:05:27.470> see<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:28.710> an

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
actual bill to see and an see it and an

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.230 
actual bill to see and an see it and an
H<00:05:30.620> yeah<00:05:31.620> so<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.400> first<00:05:32.580> one<00:05:32.700> will<00:05:32.820> be<00:05:32.850> a<00:05:32.910> sea

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
H yeah so the first one will be a sea

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.300 
H yeah so the first one will be a sea
and<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.990> next<00:05:34.200> will<00:05:34.380> be<00:05:34.440> an<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:34.740> let's<00:05:35.160> take

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
and the next will be an a so let's take

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.940 
and the next will be an a so let's take
all<00:05:35.430> our<00:05:35.460> torches<00:05:35.820> out<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.440> we'll<00:05:37.440> see<00:05:37.710> how

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
all our torches out and we'll see how

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.150 
all our torches out and we'll see how
well<00:05:38.160> we<00:05:38.310> can<00:05:38.460> do<00:05:38.669> I'm<00:05:39.570> not<00:05:39.870> I<00:05:40.110> should<00:05:40.830> have

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
well we can do I'm not I should have

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.010 
well we can do I'm not I should have
probably<00:05:41.370> looked<00:05:41.880> up<00:05:41.970> which<00:05:42.270> color<00:05:42.600> was<00:05:42.810> wit

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
probably looked up which color was wit

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.440 
probably looked up which color was wit
so<00:05:43.380> let's<00:05:44.310> say<00:05:44.460> let's<00:05:44.820> a<00:05:44.880> map<00:05:45.060> let's<00:05:45.270> figure

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
so let's say let's a map let's figure

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.420 
so let's say let's a map let's figure
this<00:05:45.570> out<00:05:45.720> ourselves<00:05:45.780> so<00:05:46.350> this<00:05:47.039> line<00:05:47.220> gets

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
this out ourselves so this line gets

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.370 
this out ourselves so this line gets
powered<00:05:48.000> will<00:05:48.750> say<00:05:48.870> this<00:05:48.960> one<00:05:49.140> getting

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
powered will say this one getting

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.070 
powered will say this one getting
powered<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.039> look<00:05:50.789> get<00:05:51.419> turned<00:05:51.660> around<00:05:51.750> with

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
powered so look get turned around with

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.969 
powered so look get turned around with
our<00:05:52.140> glutes<00:05:52.650> emails<00:05:52.919> unpowered<00:05:54.710> Howard<00:05:57.560> so<00:05:58.560> if

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
our glutes emails unpowered Howard so if

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.060 
our glutes emails unpowered Howard so if
the<00:05:59.190> line<00:05:59.460> is<00:05:59.729> powered<00:06:00.240> that<00:06:00.870> means<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.530> glass

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
the line is powered that means the glass

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.550 
the line is powered that means the glass
it<00:06:02.340> seems<00:06:02.660> because<00:06:03.660> thats<00:06:04.229> line<00:06:04.410> will

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
it seems because thats line will

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.070 
it seems because thats line will
compared<00:06:04.890> start<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.640> unpowered<00:06:06.120> this<00:06:06.810> charts

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
compared start to unpowered this charts

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.610 
compared start to unpowered this charts
will<00:06:07.169> get<00:06:07.289> powered<00:06:08.010> by<00:06:08.190> that<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:09.750> so<00:06:10.500> that

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
will get powered by that and so that

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.680 
will get powered by that and so that
keeps<00:06:10.860> the<00:06:10.950> piston<00:06:11.280> on<00:06:11.430> extended<00:06:11.940> so<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.360> torch

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
keeps the piston on extended so a torch
