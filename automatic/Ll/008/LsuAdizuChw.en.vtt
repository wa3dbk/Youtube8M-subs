00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:12.160
 So mostly older come from Leipzig 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:14.259
 I am 18 years old and I am involved in motorsport 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.700
 3 1 my dad has it on the first time 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.950
 a horse is actually set 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.360
 everything started and the problem was 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.220
 the whole story that is with the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 I always drove off in the woods 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.520
 and then we said that is 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.870
 just a bit too dangerous though 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.780
 he is already three years old 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.070
 what happen and that's us 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.320
 kart track driven to grimma 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.730
 were about four years old and by that 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.500
 my first rounds in the kart, so to speak 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.120
 I am at eight years old 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.620
 my first championship is profane 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.740
 I became third and in the on it 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.430
 following years has become increasingly successful 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.880
 European Championship qualification 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.320
 won 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.390
 won the german championship and 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.860
 Of course, at the very beginning, you never have to 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.050
 the thought played later than 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 exercise profession or paint the formula 1 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.020
 want to come 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.820
 You can only do that in the last four 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.470
 five years as one had noticed one 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.390
 is becoming more successful and you have 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.390
 a chance to be at the forefront 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.170
 So a great role model for me 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.440
 of course sebastian vettel among others 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.970
 even as singers have both shown that 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.450
 to stay on the ground despite successes 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.180
 can 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 and now this year i will be in the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.600
 formula 3 stood last year I have 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.410
 the adac formulel masters alike 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.990
 won immediately 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.760
 Of course, the dream and the goal pushes 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.350
 formula 1 time sometime a piece 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.590
 closer and you just fight that one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590
 that too 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.900
 so very early with racing games 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.670
 of course get through contact 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 playstation computer or whatever it is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 Nowadays there is everything for possibilities 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.550
 and yes she can be fascinating there 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.110
 you stretch very well on certain 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.090
 you prepare now in real 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.450
 life has not traveled since recently 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.979
 Also auto club revolution is a very 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.170
 I had a great game from there 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.580
 beginning very well purely has found it 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.220
 right now a lot of fun because it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.690
 also very close to reality 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 is and it is also very much for me 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.340
 important that you are not somewhere now 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.739
 again so that I can really what 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.280
 what is now to the reality in 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.280
 is related 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.760
 for me personally, of course heavier 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.989
 me fast in the virtual area 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.519
 to move because I'm not there 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.139
 Like many others, experience has that 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.689
 do now frequently speak 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.459
 I'm on the real track 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.620
 usually a little better right off the bat 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.290
 as in the virtual area where I too 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.659
 must say now with the new player 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.340
 acr that I'm working really well 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.629
 So there were not really any big ones 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.670
 problems create me from round to round 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.889
 increased 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 and yes, I think so everywhere 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.530
 the exercise yes that he brings the success 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.459
 on the right one to the normal 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.620
 Road traffic is hard to get there 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.709
 to take back 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.480
 It is with the rules that it is regulated 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.890
 no problem, it is very difficult 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.540
 to deal with the speed 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.070
 by being in the formula car a lot 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.150
 of course, sitting deep inside comes naturally 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.490
 even faster than it actually is 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.580
 it is already when you move that 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.100
 Road car goes and drives 200 on the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.260
 Autobahn then you come already therefore 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.910
 a bit slower than in the formula 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.100
 car that's the only problem 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.660
 a whole story so the feeling 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.370
 for the speed leaves scary 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.080
 especially if you go directly from 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.060
 Formula or in the normal street car 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.820
 but that goes with the times 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.410
 then that too has me now 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.410
 but not standing there as a rowdy yes
