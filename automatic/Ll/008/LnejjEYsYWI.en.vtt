hi I'm Gary Hall senior fan race club

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.019 
hi I'm Gary Hall senior fan race club
we've<00:00:05.500> talked<00:00:05.769> a<00:00:05.920> lot<00:00:05.950> in<00:00:06.100> the<00:00:06.220> past<00:00:06.430> about<00:00:06.669> how

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:07.029 
we've talked a lot in the past about how

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.959 
we've talked a lot in the past about how
to<00:00:07.089> reduce<00:00:07.450> drag<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.980> that<00:00:09.010> drag<00:00:09.639> is<00:00:09.670> the

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
to reduce drag and that drag is the

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.610 
to reduce drag and that drag is the
number<00:00:10.209> one<00:00:10.330> enemy<00:00:10.480> of<00:00:10.690> the<00:00:10.809> summer<00:00:11.080> today

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
number one enemy of the summer today

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.900 
number one enemy of the summer today
we're<00:00:11.799> going<00:00:11.889> to<00:00:11.980> talk<00:00:12.160> about<00:00:12.339> your<00:00:12.730> head

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:12.910 
we're going to talk about your head

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.270 
we're going to talk about your head
position<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:14.200> how<00:00:14.379> you<00:00:14.440> can<00:00:14.679> reduce<00:00:14.830> drag<00:00:15.250> by

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280 
position and how you can reduce drag by

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.359 
position and how you can reduce drag by
putting<00:00:15.820> your<00:00:15.910> head<00:00:16.059> in<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.330> proper<00:00:16.720> position

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
putting your head in the proper position

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.769 
putting your head in the proper position
your<00:00:18.369> head<00:00:18.550> is<00:00:18.669> elevated<00:00:19.180> too<00:00:19.360> high<00:00:19.540> and

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
your head is elevated too high and

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.780 
your head is elevated too high and
increases<00:00:20.290> drag<00:00:20.590> in<00:00:20.800> two<00:00:20.980> ways<00:00:21.189> one<00:00:21.579> it

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
increases drag in two ways one it

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.940 
increases drag in two ways one it
increases<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.480> surface<00:00:22.779> or<00:00:23.169> wave<00:00:23.349> drag<00:00:23.739> that

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
increases the surface or wave drag that

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.370 
increases the surface or wave drag that
hits<00:00:24.130> against<00:00:24.520> your<00:00:24.669> head<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.809> the<00:00:25.930> second

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
hits against your head and the second

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.139 
hits against your head and the second
lowers<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:26.950> have<00:00:27.160> been<00:00:27.369> change<00:00:27.640> your<00:00:27.910> body

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:28.149 
lowers you have been change your body

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.080 
lowers you have been change your body
position<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:29.050> increase<00:00:29.410> pressure<00:00:29.680> drag<00:00:30.130> so

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
position to increase pressure drag so

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.400 
position to increase pressure drag so
we're<00:00:31.210> going<00:00:31.329> to<00:00:31.390> show<00:00:31.540> you<00:00:31.570> how<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.079> put<00:00:32.380> your

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
we're going to show you how to put your

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.990 
we're going to show you how to put your
head<00:00:32.649> in<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.860> right<00:00:33.040> position<00:00:33.640> and<00:00:33.790> some

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
head in the right position and some

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.750 
head in the right position and some
drills<00:00:34.300> that<00:00:34.390> will<00:00:34.540> help<00:00:34.719> it<00:00:34.899> get<00:00:35.109> there

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
drills that will help it get there

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.220 
drills that will help it get there
first<00:00:36.760> let<00:00:37.059> me<00:00:37.089> show<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:37.690> not<00:00:37.899> to<00:00:38.109> do

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
first let me show you what not to do

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.810 
first let me show you what not to do
with<00:00:38.320> your<00:00:38.469> head<00:00:38.739> here<00:00:39.039> I've<00:00:39.190> got<00:00:39.429> my<00:00:39.640> head

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
with your head here I've got my head

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.660 
with your head here I've got my head
held<00:00:40.059> too<00:00:40.300> high<00:00:40.539> I'm<00:00:40.929> looking<00:00:41.350> forward<00:00:41.920> you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
held too high I'm looking forward you

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.209 
held too high I'm looking forward you
can<00:00:42.879> see<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.480> would<00:00:43.600> create<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.230> bad<00:00:44.920> head

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
can see it it would create a bad head

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.700 
can see it it would create a bad head
position<00:00:45.730> for<00:00:45.969> surface<00:00:46.390> drag<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:47.019> also<00:00:47.199> lowers

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
position for surface drag it also lowers

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.009 
position for surface drag it also lowers
the<00:00:48.100> hips<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.550> can<00:00:48.699> see<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.210> body<00:00:49.420> is<00:00:49.659> not<00:00:49.960> in

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
the hips you can see the body is not in

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.560 
the hips you can see the body is not in
alignment<00:00:50.499> the<00:00:51.280> feet<00:00:51.579> and<00:00:51.699> legs<00:00:51.909> are<00:00:52.179> low<00:00:52.390> in

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
alignment the feet and legs are low in

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.930 
alignment the feet and legs are low in
the<00:00:52.690> water<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.800> overall<00:00:54.159> position<00:00:54.819> of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
the water and the overall position of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.970 
the water and the overall position of
the<00:00:55.059> body<00:00:55.300> creates<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.960> lot<00:00:56.199> of<00:00:56.230> pressure<00:00:56.559> drag

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
the body creates a lot of pressure drag

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.619 
the body creates a lot of pressure drag
as<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.339> swim<00:00:57.670> through<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:57.999> water<00:00:58.210> with<00:00:58.480> the

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
as you swim through the water with the

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.069 
as you swim through the water with the
head<00:00:58.839> this<00:00:59.589> high<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.969> I<00:01:00.999> put<00:01:01.390> my<00:01:01.569> head<00:01:01.809> in<00:01:01.989> the

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
head this high now I put my head in the

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.920 
head this high now I put my head in the
proper<00:01:02.559> position<00:01:03.190> with<00:01:03.909> the<00:01:04.059> chin<00:01:04.390> down<00:01:04.629> and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
proper position with the chin down and

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.780 
proper position with the chin down and
you<00:01:04.989> can<00:01:05.170> see<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.530> wave<00:01:05.710> go<00:01:06.010> over<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.520> top<00:01:06.760> of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
you can see the wave go over the top of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.660 
you can see the wave go over the top of
my<00:01:07.090> head<00:01:07.360> over<00:01:07.660> my<00:01:07.960> back<00:01:08.550> reducing<00:01:09.550> the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
my head over my back reducing the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.330 
my head over my back reducing the
surface<00:01:09.880> drag<00:01:10.390> but<00:01:11.110> also<00:01:11.290> look<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.160> does

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
surface drag but also look what it does

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.270 
surface drag but also look what it does
to<00:01:12.550> my<00:01:12.700> body<00:01:12.730> position<00:01:13.380> now<00:01:14.380> my<00:01:14.650> hips<00:01:14.890> are<00:01:15.130> up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
to my body position now my hips are up

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520 
to my body position now my hips are up
near<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.730> surface<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.870> body<00:01:17.140> is<00:01:17.380> in

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
near the surface the body is in

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.890 
near the surface the body is in
alignment<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.730> enables<00:01:19.270> me<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.510> swim

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
alignment and it enables me to swim

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.690 
alignment and it enables me to swim
through<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.230> water<00:01:20.260> with<00:01:21.130> much<00:01:21.430> less

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
through the water with much less

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.040 
through the water with much less

high<00:01:37.420> looking<00:01:37.900> forward<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.920> see<00:01:39.190> it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
high looking forward and you see it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.970 
high looking forward and you see it
causes<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.940> hips<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.330> be<00:01:40.510> too<00:01:40.720> low<00:01:40.990> when<00:01:41.950> I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
causes the hips to be too low when I

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.280 
causes the hips to be too low when I
drop<00:01:42.370> my<00:01:42.400> head<00:01:42.790> down<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.510> very<00:01:44.050> little
