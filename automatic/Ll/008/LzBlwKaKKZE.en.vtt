00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
of the boards the reason you go 3/4 of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520 
of the boards the reason you go 3/4 of
an<00:01:11.640> inch<00:01:11.729> past<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> floor<00:01:13.260> joist

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530

an inch past is because the floor joist
boards<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:14.340> be<00:01:14.460> installing<00:01:14.790> on

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
boards that you will be installing on

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.179 
boards that you will be installing on
the<00:01:15.150> marks<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.689> 1<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.110> 1/2<00:01:16.200> inches<00:01:16.619> wide

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the marks are 1 and 1/2 inches wide

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.370 
the marks are 1 and 1/2 inches wide
if<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.210> center<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> board<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.259> at

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
if the center of the board is to be at

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
if the center of the board is to be at
16<00:01:19.830> inches<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.310> center<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.330> edge<00:01:21.600> will

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
16 inches on center then the edge will

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.410 
16 inches on center then the edge will
need<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.290> 3/4<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.100> inch<00:01:23.189> past<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.850> 16

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
need to be 3/4 of an inch past the 16

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.200 
need to be 3/4 of an inch past the 16
inch<00:01:24.600> point<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.220> easier<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> line<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
inch point it is easier to line up the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.940 
inch point it is easier to line up the
edge<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> board<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.170> mark<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
edge of the board with the mark that it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
edge of the board with the mark that it
is<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> line<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> center<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> board

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
is to line up the center of the board

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.350 
is to line up the center of the board
thus<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.920> marks<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.400> 16<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> 3/4<00:01:33.659> 32<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> 3/4

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
thus the marks are 16 and 3/4 32 and 3/4

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.210 
thus the marks are 16 and 3/4 32 and 3/4
48<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.540> 3/4<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:39.650> once<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> layout

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
48 and 3/4 and so on once all the layout

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
48 and 3/4 and so on once all the layout
marks<00:01:41.490> are<00:01:41.640> made<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.150> transfer<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
marks are made you will transfer the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
marks are made you will transfer the
marks<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> other<00:01:43.530> board<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> line

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
marks to the other board and make a line

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.050 
marks to the other board and make a line
across<00:01:44.970> both<00:01:45.540> boards<00:01:45.990> using<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> speed<00:01:46.619> square

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
across both boards using a speed square
