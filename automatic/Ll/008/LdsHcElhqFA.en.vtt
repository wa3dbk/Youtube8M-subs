00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.870
 1 2 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.870
 ah 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.570
 find the first seven multiples of 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:19.740
 three four and five let's remember a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.380
 little the definition of multiples of a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.910
 number the multiples of a number are 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.910
 the numbers that we get when 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.609
 we multiply that number by the numbers 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:36.199
 natural remember that the numbers 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:44.730
 natural are 1 on 2 on 3 on 4 on 5 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:47.850
 the 6 the 7 the 8 the 9 the 10 11 12 and so 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.399
 successively then what are we going to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.700
 to do is and whenever they come up 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.520
 exercises of this kind is multiply 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.010
 the 3 for each of the numbers that 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.340
 they form the set of numbers 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.860
 natural then as the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.620
 exercise is to find the first seven 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.260
 multiples then what we're going to do 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.010
 Is to write 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.110
 the first seven numbers that make 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.860
 part of the set of numbers 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.220
 natural 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:28.690
 they are 1 of 2 3 4 on 5 on 6 and the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.570
 7 then these are the first seven 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.670
 natural numbers to find the seven 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.350
 first multiples of 3 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.990
 let's place a point above 3 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 which is what it means they are the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.300
 set of multiples of 3 in this 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:53.229
 case the first 7 and how are we going to do 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.630
 let's multiply the number 3 by the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.340
 first element of the set of 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:02.710
 natural numbers that is 3 by 1 is 3 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 then 3 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.349
 is 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.650
 the first element that is a multiple of 3 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.970
 the second one we will get 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.670
 multiplying 3 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.670
 by 2 which is 6 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.870
 and so on 3 x 3 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.790
 9 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.040
 then 3 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.040
 4 and 12 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.930
 3 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.930
 5 is 15 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:51.560
 and 3 x 6 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 and that 83 by 7 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.950
 20 1 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.459
 then the first seven multiples of 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:08.640
 three are 3 on 6 on 9 on 12 on 15 and 18 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.980
 21 then now let's do the same 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.860
 case for him 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.080
 On the 4th we will see what are the multiples 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.170
 of 4 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.540
 then multiply the 4 by the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.430
 first element that is part of the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.420
 set of natural numbers is 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:38.870
 say 4 for 1 3 4 and this result is the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.840
 first multiple of 4 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.260
 the second multiple of 4 is obtained 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.540
 multiplying 4 by the second element 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.060
 of the set of the natural numbers is 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.060
 say 4 times 2 is 8 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.510
 and the next one is obtained by multiplying 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:03.920
 the for its consecutive is to say 4 for 3 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.920
 what is 12 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:15.050
 now we multiply 4x4 is 16 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.560
 4 x 5 what is 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:24.160
 twenty 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:27.550
 and 4 times 6 is 24 and the last one is the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:34.110
 seventh multiple of 4 is obtained 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.110
 multiplying 4 by 7 which is 28 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.480
 we have already formed the set 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.280
 of the first seven multiples of 4 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.670
 now let's find 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:52.320
 the multiples of 5 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.870
 and we're going to do it by multiplying 5 by 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.270
 each of the elements that make 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:05.540
 part of the first seven numbers 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.540
 natural is to say one for five is 5 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.150
 5 x 2 is 10 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.860
 5 x 3 is 15 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.560
 5 x 4 is 20 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.669
 5 x 5 is 25 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.210
 and 5 times 6 is 30 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.489
 5 and 7 is 35 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:46.189
 and in this way you can always 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:50.269
 find the multiples of any 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:54.319
 number it is multiplying the number 

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:56.300
 given by each of the elements that 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.459
 they are part of the set of numbers 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.019
 natural good I hope that the 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.729
 explanation of this exercise and it has been 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:06.669
 of great benefit to you all 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.669
 until another next tutorial goodbye
