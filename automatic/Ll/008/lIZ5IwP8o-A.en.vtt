00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.650
 also worth it 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.380
 initially uah 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.340
 it would be logical 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.739
 arrest issued a knife 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.739
 all 11 years 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.509
 by the way i ask you 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 but despite the fact that she was famous 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.310
 the situation is beyond mattresses 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.759
 this we still succeed 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.220
 work is underway to qualify 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.220
 reached us 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.220
 all this is interesting 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.750
 it's hard on your own what with 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.750
 700 thousand 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.019
 on this option 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.019
 for me as a person 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.870
 sleepless nights 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.260
 as lead 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.200
 it is enough to remember what 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 when 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 pilot 17 1 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.800
 particular must 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.840
 bitter 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.370
 boron combine 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.430
 possible yes rather than no 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.930
 lost 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.930
 industry 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.390
 to everyone 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.400
 for example recently 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.739
 therefore, one of the tasks is to ensure 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 not long after half an hour 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 plenipotentiary ambassador 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.219
 constant change 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.329
 all people decided 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.209
 This will help solve this problem. 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.469
 in his opinion 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.089
 the story 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.119
 farther and farther 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.119
 0102 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.439
 normal security 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.439
 and then grandma 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.699
 usually points 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:49.149
 I can 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.149
 the indicator is slightly higher 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.259
 Further 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.259
 moreover, our 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.819
 if one and a half years 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:29.029
 us agency 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.069
 were there any choices 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 e 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.499
 millions of people 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.599
 so here's gotta figure it out 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.800
 then I do 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.139
 any 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.139
 there is a desire 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.909
 on this occasion 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.909
 and Karabakh 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.770
 it happens 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.900
 now we know 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.710
 now the situation 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.749
 such help 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:55.749
 way salavat yulaev 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.629
 Viktor Schreider 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.469
 but it was no less 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:10.699
 for the city house
