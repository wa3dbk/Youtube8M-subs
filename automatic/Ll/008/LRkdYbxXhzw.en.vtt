00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.369
 let's continue on this side we're going 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.730
 to unite all in this way already 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.930
 then let's draw a circle 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:42.080
 for what will be the head of the job 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.210
 next will be to draw the arms in 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.610
 this case to draw hands we are going to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.129
 draw this little circle and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.379
 we continue with the other arm for this 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.780

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.720
 These lines 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.050
 and we're going to start shaping the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.410

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.870
 way 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.700
 now let's detail the face of him and 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.940
 for that we draw the eyebrows 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.230
 the eyes the nose 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.630
 and then the mouth teeth and the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.180
 language 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.049
 we add details to those in the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.619
 eyebrows and eyes we detail more features 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.759

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.579
 as you can see the face already took shape what 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.850
 next will draw this line here 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:57.319
 by the chest this line here and as 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.229
 we are going to define the muscles of the 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.750
 shoulders back the chest we draw 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.300

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.720
 and we began to detail as I said 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.030
 muscles of shoulders bizet 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.060

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.250
 definition in this arm and we continue 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.480
 drawing in this case the hand of this 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.930

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.270
 they are going to draw the other point for that 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.890
 we draw these lines to form the 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.450
 fingers we add the thumb the nail and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.050
 our drawing is taking shape 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.500
 now the next thing will be to draw the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.739

 then let's draw the other foot 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.090
 as we did before and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.230
 We will add the nails to each of the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.920
 fingers 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.930
 our pants in this case the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.050
 pants rips 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.200
 we will begin to define them so they can 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.050
 to do it freely the important thing is that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.700

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.700

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.700
 terminal 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.800
 then we use our 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.340
 marker in this case thick marker 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.520
 for the outline and then we will use 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 a fine point marker for the 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.740

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.740
