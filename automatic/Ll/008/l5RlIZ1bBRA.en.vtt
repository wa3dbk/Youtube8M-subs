00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.500
cars.com auto review

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.530
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com worth
the New York Auto Show checking out the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.330
redesigned

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.840
BMW 5-series this is the sixth
generation

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840
have the five series it was introduced
overseas a little while ago

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.699
this is the US introduction car it'll
come on sale in June

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.350
in 535 and 550 I trams

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.590
this 5-series digits predecessors more
controversial luck with for the eyebrow

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.840
headlights and more slab sided exterior
for something that really looks like it

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.720
belongs between

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.690
the 7-series and the 3-series notice
BMW's kidney grilles

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.470
there a little bit lower on the face and
they lean a little bit forward now

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.510
the headlights look more conventional
really I think this is a very solid

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.220
looking car

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.010
car that belong stylistically after the
beloved e39 5-series from 97 to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.600
2003 so let's just kinda forget about
the are the game between the two

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.980
that materials are pretty good but some
might find buy shares a little more

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.690
austere less inviting then

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.229
cars like the Mercedes e-class the
Infiniti am on

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.570
it's always been kinda true dat remains
true today still some cool stuff going

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.500
on here there's a 10-point two-inch

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.830
screen for the center navigation display
at absolutely huge

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.509
the climate controls here have settings
that show up on this black panel that

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.140
otherwise looks like a trim piece around
it below them

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.310
real couplers not the clumsy flip out
one's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.410
in loving daddy's BMW says

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.820
this new five series has a significantly
longer wheelbase

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
and a little bit larger overall
dimensions than the outgoing passers but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.140
it still feels like a small car inside

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.689
and that's especially evident in the
back seat a I've got plenty of thigh

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.710
support here

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.880
the seats nice and long but 6 voters are
definitely in a fine leg room a little

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.390
bit tight

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.780
high-tech features include a top-down
bird's eye

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.860
camera to help out with tight part
situations and cars with the sport

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.009
package will get BMW's adaptive drive
with active roll stabilization that

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.090
helps mitigate body roll on your corner
and real hard the 535 hi

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.180
has a 300-horsepower turbocharged
six-cylinder

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.790
550 I has a 400 horsepower turbocharged

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.380
the 8 keep an eye out for those cost
about fifty and sixty thousand dollars

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.110
respectively

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.650
or if you want something a little less
expensive there's going to be a 240

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.320
horsepower

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.230
528 I coming out later this year
