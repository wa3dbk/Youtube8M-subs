suits your application so let's look at
some<00:01:05.019> of<00:01:05.079> the<00:01:05.140> features<00:01:05.439> of<00:01:05.469> the<00:01:05.590> tractor<00:01:06.009> look

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
some of the features of the tractor look

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.059 
some of the features of the tractor look
yeah<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.319> new<00:01:08.439> thing<00:01:08.679> for<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.920> road

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
yeah so the the new thing for the road

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.190 
yeah so the the new thing for the road
track<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.569> obviously<00:01:10.569> the<00:01:10.689> narrower<00:01:10.960> track

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
track is obviously the narrower track

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.050 
track is obviously the narrower track
that<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:11.409> talked<00:01:11.679> about<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.100> Sean<00:01:12.280> if<00:01:12.399> you<00:01:12.490> just

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
that I talked about so Sean if you just

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.429 
that I talked about so Sean if you just
have<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.240> quick<00:01:13.450> look<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:14.079> tracks<00:01:14.229> are

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
have a quick look the tracks are

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.179 
have a quick look the tracks are
available<00:01:14.530> from<00:01:14.890> two<00:01:15.069> different

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
available from two different

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.090 
available from two different
manufacturers<00:01:15.880> goodyear<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.689> camel<00:01:17.679> plastic

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
manufacturers goodyear and camel plastic

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.069 
manufacturers goodyear and camel plastic
both<00:01:18.999> of<00:01:19.179> which<00:01:19.270> we<00:01:19.479> are<00:01:19.659> going<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.869> give<00:01:19.990> you

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
both of which we are going to give you

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.569 
both of which we are going to give you
very<00:01:20.109> similar<00:01:20.590> performance<00:01:20.740> as<00:01:21.159> far<00:01:21.310> as<00:01:21.429> life

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
very similar performance as far as life

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.399 
very similar performance as far as life
like<00:01:22.179> longevity<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.240> track<00:01:25.509> was<00:01:26.049> mounted

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
like longevity the the track was mounted

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.559 
like longevity the the track was mounted
onto<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.679> different<00:01:27.130> under<00:01:27.789> carrier<00:01:28.149> something

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
onto a different under carrier something

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:29.879 
onto a different under carrier something
that<00:01:28.689> is<00:01:28.810> different<00:01:29.200> from<00:01:29.289> today's<00:01:29.619> squat

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:29.889 
that is different from today's squat

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.499 
that is different from today's squat
rack<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.369> looks<00:01:30.549> different<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.119> does<00:01:31.299> doesn't

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
rack it looks different it does doesn't

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.090 
rack it looks different it does doesn't
it<00:01:31.630> yeah<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.109> a<00:01:32.139> larger<00:01:32.590> drive<00:01:32.799> wheel

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
it yeah we have a larger drive wheel

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.359 
it yeah we have a larger drive wheel
which<00:01:34.289> basically<00:01:35.289> can<00:01:35.499> go<00:01:35.619> narrower<00:01:35.859> track<00:01:36.219> we

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
which basically can go narrower track we

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.029 
which basically can go narrower track we
need<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.549> longer<00:01:36.819> contact<00:01:37.810> area<00:01:38.109> so<00:01:38.799> with<00:01:38.920> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
need a longer contact area so with the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.529 
need a longer contact area so with the
larger<00:01:39.369> diameter<00:01:39.549> we<00:01:39.939> get<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.179> longer

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
larger diameter we get the longer

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.109 
larger diameter we get the longer
contact<00:01:40.990> area<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.469> track<00:01:41.709> okay<00:01:42.219> because

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
contact area to the track okay because

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.269 
contact area to the track okay because
for<00:01:43.389> the<00:01:43.450> most<00:01:43.600> part<00:01:43.719> these<00:01:44.350> tracks<00:01:44.619> do<00:01:45.039> run

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:45.279 
for the most part these tracks do run

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:48.260 
for the most part these tracks do run
friction<00:01:46.149> by<00:01:46.929> friction<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:47.499> when<00:01:48.069> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
friction by friction and when the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.760 
friction by friction and when the
pulling<00:01:49.270> gets<00:01:49.420> tough<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.929> the<00:01:50.289> drive<00:01:50.529> lugs

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
pulling gets tough the the drive lugs

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.130 
pulling gets tough the the drive lugs

here<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.880> frame<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.270> built<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.570> take<00:04:28.720> on

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
here is the frame is built to take on

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.409 
here is the frame is built to take on
both<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.530> don't<00:04:29.710> put<00:04:29.860> extra<00:04:30.729> components<00:04:31.330> in

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
both so we don't put extra components in

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.940 
both so we don't put extra components in
to<00:04:31.570> handle<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.900> higher<00:04:32.080> more<00:04:32.560> aggressive

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
to handle a higher more aggressive

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.300 
to handle a higher more aggressive
situation<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.900> comes<00:04:35.260> built<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.680> go<00:04:36.099> into<00:04:36.280> a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
situation it comes built to go into a

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.190 
situation it comes built to go into a
heavier<00:04:36.639> application<00:04:37.389> right<00:04:37.510> off<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.690> bat<00:04:37.870> so

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
heavier application right off the bat so

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.629 
heavier application right off the bat so
we<00:04:38.710> carry<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.099> right<00:04:39.250> through<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.550> there

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
we carry that right through and there

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.370 
we carry that right through and there

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
features on here that we can talk about

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.779 
features on here that we can talk about
we<00:04:46.720> draw<00:04:47.380> on<00:04:47.440> some<00:04:47.530> other<00:04:47.830> innovations<00:04:48.550> on<00:04:48.669> the

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
we draw on some other innovations on the

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.390 
we draw on some other innovations on the
new<00:04:48.990> Stigers<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:50.680> is<00:04:50.830> an<00:04:50.919> option<00:04:51.190> on<00:04:51.250> the

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
new Stigers this is an option on the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.710 
new Stigers this is an option on the
wheeled<00:04:51.550> unit<00:04:51.880> but<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.150> standard<00:04:52.479> equipped

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
wheeled unit but it's standard equipped

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.810 
wheeled unit but it's standard equipped
on<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:52.900> quad<00:04:53.110> track<00:04:53.349> and<00:04:53.590> that's<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.430> same<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.789> a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
on a quad track and that's the same on a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.400 
on a quad track and that's the same on a
road<00:04:55.030> track<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:55.630> what<00:04:55.750> you'll<00:04:55.900> find<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.229> we've

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
road track but what you'll find is we've

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.440 
road track but what you'll find is we've
basically<00:04:57.010> isolated<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.760> cap<00:04:57.940> through<00:04:58.389> a

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
basically isolated the cap through a

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.379 
basically isolated the cap through a
suspension<00:04:58.810> system<00:04:58.990> from<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.560> chassis<00:04:59.950> so

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
suspension system from the chassis so

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.500 
suspension system from the chassis so
any<00:05:01.389> roughness<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:02.050> road<00:05:02.289> roughness<00:05:02.860> in<00:05:03.039> field

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
any roughness of road roughness in field

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.670 
any roughness of road roughness in field
what<00:05:04.510> we<00:05:04.599> have<00:05:04.720> inside<00:05:05.050> of<00:05:05.200> here<00:05:05.320> is<00:05:05.410> basically

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
what we have inside of here is basically

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.040 
what we have inside of here is basically
a<00:05:05.800> coil<00:05:06.039> spring<00:05:06.780> dampened<00:05:07.780> through<00:05:08.020> a

a coil spring dampened through a

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.779 
a coil spring dampened through a
pressurized<00:05:08.530> nitrogen<00:05:08.620> shock<00:05:09.190> absorber<00:05:09.669> and

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
pressurized nitrogen shock absorber and

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.150 
pressurized nitrogen shock absorber and
then<00:05:10.450> we<00:05:10.570> limit<00:05:10.870> or<00:05:10.990> controlled<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.650> sway<00:05:11.889> and

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
then we limit or controlled the sway and

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.740 
then we limit or controlled the sway and
the<00:05:12.460> rocking<00:05:12.849> action<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.330> cab<00:05:13.510> through

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
the rocking action of the cab through

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.290 
the rocking action of the cab through
panhard<00:05:14.110> bars<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.620> anti-sway<00:05:15.070> bars<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:16.180> it

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
panhard bars and anti-sway bars so it

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.730 
panhard bars and anti-sway bars so it
does<00:05:16.450> two<00:05:16.599> things<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.960> gives<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.200> rider<00:05:17.410> more

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
does two things it gives a rider more

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.250 
does two things it gives a rider more
comfortable<00:05:18.280> feel<00:05:18.460> in<00:05:18.639> the<00:05:18.729> cab<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.750> just

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
comfortable feel in the cab that just

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.839 
comfortable feel in the cab that just
helps<00:05:20.530> us<00:05:20.620> keep<00:05:20.770> things<00:05:21.039> intact<00:05:21.370> in<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.669> cab

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
helps us keep things intact in the cab

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.940 
helps us keep things intact in the cab
better<00:05:22.090> than<00:05:22.270> some<00:05:22.870> of<00:05:22.960> our<00:05:22.990> older<00:05:23.260> quad

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
better than some of our older quad

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.320 
better than some of our older quad
tracks<00:05:24.220> that<00:05:24.520> may<00:05:24.700> be<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:24.849> little<00:05:25.030> rough<00:05:25.210> for

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
tracks that may be a little rough for

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.420 
tracks that may be a little rough for
riding<00:05:25.590> but<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.680> also<00:05:26.800> gives<00:05:27.070> us<00:05:27.190> more

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
riding but it also gives us more

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.110 
riding but it also gives us more

guy Department spent a lot of time in

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.670 
guy Department spent a lot of time in
these<00:05:37.250> machines<00:05:37.669> so<00:05:38.000> you<00:05:38.780> know<00:05:38.930> cab<00:05:39.229> comfort

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
these machines so you know cab comfort

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.350 
these machines so you know cab comfort
is<00:05:39.830> probably<00:05:40.130> more<00:05:40.310> important<00:05:40.790> than<00:05:40.820> we

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
is probably more important than we

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.270 
is probably more important than we
initially<00:05:41.720> probably<00:05:42.110> thought<00:05:42.440> through<00:05:43.160> the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
initially probably thought through the

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.340 
initially probably thought through the
years<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.639> now<00:05:43.760> they've<00:05:44.300> become<00:05:44.449> more<00:05:44.840> cabins

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
years and now they've become more cabins

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.920 
years and now they've become more cabins
their<00:05:46.220> fleets<00:05:46.550> exactly<00:05:47.419> they're<00:05:47.540> very<00:05:47.750> nice

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
their fleets exactly they're very nice

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.629 
their fleets exactly they're very nice
yeah<00:05:48.199> you're<00:05:48.350> exactly<00:05:48.620> right<00:05:48.680> Ron<00:05:48.949> so<00:05:49.490> if<00:05:49.550> you

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
yeah you're exactly right Ron so if you

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.159 
yeah you're exactly right Ron so if you
look<00:05:49.760> at<00:05:49.850> some<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.120> inside<00:05:50.419> if<00:05:50.840> we<00:05:50.990> talk<00:05:51.139> a

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
look at some of the inside if we talk a

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.080 
look at some of the inside if we talk a
bit<00:05:51.410> about<00:05:51.440> that<00:05:51.650> older<00:05:52.250> tractors<00:05:52.699> and<00:05:52.880> even

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
bit about that older tractors and even

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.939 
bit about that older tractors and even
some<00:05:53.210> of<00:05:53.330> today's<00:05:53.449> competitors<00:05:54.169> of<00:05:54.350> our<00:05:54.590> case

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
with GPS auto steer systems you're

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.680 
with GPS auto steer systems you're
looking<00:06:04.639> like<00:06:04.760> this<00:06:04.940> most<00:06:05.150> of<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.360> time<00:06:05.510> then

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
looking like this most of the time then

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.180 
looking like this most of the time then
you<00:06:05.750> are<00:06:05.780> like<00:06:06.020> this<00:06:06.199> so<00:06:06.530> we're<00:06:06.949> allowed<00:06:07.160> to

you are like this so we're allowed to

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.279 
you are like this so we're allowed to
pivot<00:06:07.550> around<00:06:07.639> and<00:06:08.090> that's<00:06:08.660> given<00:06:08.960> us<00:06:09.050> the

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
pivot around and that's given us the

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.790 
pivot around and that's given us the
ability<00:06:09.500> now<00:06:09.919> to<00:06:10.930> an<00:06:11.930> opportunity<00:06:12.560> shall<00:06:12.770> I

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
standpoint we really made think simple

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.360 
standpoint we really made think simple
with<00:06:35.330> the<00:06:35.389> new<00:06:35.479> car<00:06:35.690> right<00:06:35.930> yeah<00:06:36.889> you<00:06:37.099> know<00:06:37.190> for

with the new car right yeah you know for

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.560 
with the new car right yeah you know for
the<00:06:37.430> farmers<00:06:37.729> that<00:06:37.760> do<00:06:37.970> their<00:06:38.120> own<00:06:38.180> service

them<00:06:39.979> to<00:06:40.039> the<00:06:40.099> dealerships<00:06:40.550> so<00:06:40.940> we're<00:06:41.090> trying

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
them to the dealerships so we're trying

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.990 
them to the dealerships so we're trying
to<00:06:41.419> give<00:06:41.630> them<00:06:41.840> easier<00:06:42.520> easier<00:06:43.520> access<00:06:43.669> to<00:06:43.849> the
