00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 However 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.190
 * 1 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.190
 Figure 1 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.080
 Of this era 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.109
 This rise is also 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.379
 I think I will say that this person is the same age 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.510
 In the case of the person of the optical disk, that ejaculation is used very much 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.380
 is not it 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.789
 For example this 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.360
 There is a movie called the Snow Festival 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.020
 is not it 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.890
 Next, this is occupied and it is written in the port 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.479
 Matsuura I'll be leaving soon 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:43.450
 A representation of the snow with this snow that looks white while being written in polka-dot 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.960
 You use it roughly 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.140
 The rest is written to work at the place where Gonishi six are going 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.690
 But the ground color of the team 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200
 Give it this outline 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.130
 By trying this instant ink 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.729
 To express snow 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.729
 I'm doing it and then I ' 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.119
 I have been here for a while 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.879
 This is 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.510
 Showing the morning sun 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 That's an example from the previous week 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.120
 I was advancing the way to express in this way but this 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 It is marathon 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.120
 then 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.960
 My son, Maruyama, is in fourth place 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.719
 It is called Nagasawa Ro seat 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.050
 That person goes 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.580
 This person's agent 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.860
 This one is 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.220
 It is this 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.140
 This may seem like a palette when you see it 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.590
 Not really this is Ms. finger 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.080
 claw 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.930
 in addition 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.590
 I made it hot 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.510
 That's why I'm writing so it's very limited 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.930
 Thinking that Hyun Seok is a strong enemy 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.680
 You are writing 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.420
 So I write that I only put this on this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.510
 It is said that the third place will remain Honda glare 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.049
 Improve your doctor's performance 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660
 It will be the core 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.380
 So this performance is still planned 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 I'm writing Lotte who is doing 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 We will meet with paper 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.390
 That's right there 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 You're aiming for something improvised. 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.239
 Then one more of this is the setting bran restaurant 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.349
 It is a well-known blog with high work efficiency 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.730
 That plum is written, but it is just as clear 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.440
 Is 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.510
 change 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.510
 Travel costs were rising but once 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.959
 The city enters and remains at the bottom 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.719
 A friendship show like being petaled 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.319
 I did the same thing 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.759
 I think it's okay for everyone 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.749
 It is said that it is ahead 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.599
 It did not come out at all until writing also happened 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.799
 1047 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.159
 A distinctive 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.879
 That's right 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.259
 Another person 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.989
 I am young 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:50.850
 Tokyo 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.709
 Six cut 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.769
 Line up 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.060
 18th century 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.020
 The Kyoto Cabinet has a goal of promoting Soga. 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.109
 Fit stops automatically 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.149
 By all means probably Kyoto Kyoto's book of Kamikyo Ward 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.329
 Dyed material of the north of the city 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.470
 To one trader 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.409
 I was born from a pine that I thought was a person born 2 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.079
 It is different, but if this person is a representative work 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.719
 There is a map style 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.459
 Morikami Morita's now of drama touch 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.579
 It is a hotel from s 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.539
 This kind of strange kiterez 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.219
 I want someone who has done it last time and support it again 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.079
 Especially in the second half of this 18th century Kyoto where there are people 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.430
 On the other hand, it is such a form to represent 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.430
 It means that there is a rough ground 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.599
 Seems to be weak in the US 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.600
 As for what kind of swing you can do before 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.449
 Food reserve 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.629
 In the company fire 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:48.980
 fox or 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.900
 Let's take a look 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.209
 For example this is a sunflower of the air 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.749
 To good 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:57.279
 chicken 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.479
 It is a big turn but 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.919
 That sunflower is so much 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.799
 Mostly written on the desk 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.799
 Furthermore, this painting exhibition was not so rare 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.039
 It is cheap over 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.149
 Let's have that baby 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.759
 I'm thinking about it for 3 days 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.959
 It is said that it is 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.470
 It indicates that Asahi is starting to climb 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.719
 is not it 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.490
 So here the sunflowers are individually broken down 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.120
 It is said that it is beginning to move now 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.479
 So it comes out in the observation that such a thing is covered 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.189
 It is written that 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.039
 For example, this sunflower high 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.309
 Like this 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.279
 This time in Japan 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:39.349
 Sunflower 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.630
 One side wrote 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.479
 Emergency 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.509
 I want you to do it by all means at this age of 18 adults are commuting 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.509
 It was written a little past 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.000
 More than legal 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.409
 More than a century ago 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:52.379
 2 next 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.870
 In this Japan 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.030
 There is a certain number of foreign fielders on this island 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.129
 So chosen as Maeyama theme and thus very much 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.620
 A country called a teacher 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.830
 And that the power is suppressed 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.340
 I would like to ask other 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.339
 Another 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.800
 There is such a house while being eaten fluidly This is 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 Although station home is written, 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.190
 If you look closely, it is you 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.970
 Actually this is 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.039
 Figure 12 with a large object 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.789
 You are getting money 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.189
 Beijing has never been 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.889
 It is written 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.460
 So you can not get up early 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.600
 And 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.849
 Hanyu in the vip room 5 minutes to the castle 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.389
 You're adding costs 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.839
 What kind of effect comes out 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:38.150
 This big game 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.099
 Sale 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.300
 I feel like I'm thinking fast 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.059
 You are born with nature 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.950
 Effect 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.249
 Such like to put out 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:50.990
 Because things are being done 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.279
 Interesting form 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.779
 At the same time as the fun of being tired 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.229
 emark that's when it's legal 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.469
 It is also said that that matter 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:02.870
 Eco says this 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.510
 28 days joint 28 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.500
 A lot of different painters still out a lot 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.350
 And 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.630
 Yeah it 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.389
 So 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:13.750
 Picture of a station 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.779
 Give instructions 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.949
 In other words, the street of Kyoto 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.249
 Robbed by force 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:21.949
 Kyoto has 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.449
 that 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.930
 The strength of the culture is the age of Kumano Gakuda 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.339
 It is also a horse that you are thinking well 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:31.129
 It is a thing
