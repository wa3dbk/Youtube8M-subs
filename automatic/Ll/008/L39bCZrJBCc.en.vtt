00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.670
 central bank policy brought 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.830
 Russia to the level of Papua New Guinea 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.650
 financial regulator data in the past 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.330
 year the level of monetization of the economy 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.390
 The ratio of money supply to GDP was 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.730
 34 percent of these indicators have none 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.430
 one of the developed countries and an average of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.980
 the world he is 125 percent 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.990
 the monetization of the economy is its saturated with 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 money is the money that people 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.250
 get paid as a salary 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 stores lays on vacation and keeps 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 in banks actually what happened 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 this is man-made sabotage 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 side of the liberal team which 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.850
 caused by three circumstances 1 complete 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.329
 misunderstanding how economics works 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 second absolutely no less manage it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 the very mechanism that they were given in hand and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 finally third i think i played my 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.879
 Are there corruption schemes because I donâ€™t 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 I believe that the employees of the bank center 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 called their friends bank guys here 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.350
 right now will be ready in the central bank say 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.900
 low money supply helps fight 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.790
 with inflation in the country but for some reason not cb 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.740
 takes into account that inflation in Russia is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.600
 most are not monetary 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.820
 character that is not formed because 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.530
 the fact that there is too much money in the economy 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.400
 and for example for growth rates for 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.869
 electricity and gas that we had in 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.790
 nineties leading to default 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.020
 and set recruit existence 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 Russian economy 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.960
 this is exactly the very thing that was in Ukraine 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.450
 2008 next year is what 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.970
 led Ukraine to economic 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 disaster and the coming to power of the Nazis 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.700
 I think our liberals want to do 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.770
 in Russia, too, that their colleagues did 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.049
 on the knee intentionally or unknowingly 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 Central Bank of Russia if followed without 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.850
 monetary policy is only 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.549
 guess one clear scheme of the 90s already 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.399
 outdated economy you need to reanimate with 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.020
 using big financial reform maria
