00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
closer to the scene unfortunate we have

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.580 
closer to the scene unfortunate we have
unfortunately<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> haven't<00:00:43.140> been<00:00:43.290> able<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
unfortunately we haven't been able to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.670 
unfortunately we haven't been able to
work<00:00:43.769> that<00:00:43.949> out<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.960> law<00:00:45.960> enforcement<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
work that out with law enforcement to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.299 
work that out with law enforcement to
allow<00:00:46.949> them<00:00:47.190> access<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.790> access<00:00:49.040> but<00:00:50.040> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
allow them access to have access but in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
allow them access to have access but in
any<00:00:50.460> event<00:00:51.049> when<00:00:52.049> they're<00:00:52.199> finished<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
any event when they're finished that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.799 
any event when they're finished that
will<00:00:52.769> be<00:00:52.890> turning<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> over<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.489> us<00:00:53.729> so<00:00:53.970> that's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
will be turning it over to us so that's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.479 
will be turning it over to us so that's
that's<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.409> best<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.769> can<00:00:55.799> do<00:00:56.040> at<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.400> point

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that's the best we can do at this point

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.229 
that's the best we can do at this point
it's<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.900> what<00:00:58.080> we<00:00:58.110> wanted<00:00:58.909> we<00:00:59.909> feel

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it's it's not what we wanted we feel

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.430 
it's it's not what we wanted we feel
that<00:01:00.799> once<00:01:01.799> a<00:01:01.949> scene<00:01:02.220> is<00:01:03.049> we<00:01:04.049> should<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.350> able

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
that once a scene is we should be able

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.710 
that once a scene is we should be able
to<00:01:04.620> observe<00:01:04.890> even<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.060> from<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.360> distance

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720

told that that was I heard the case I

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.279 
told that that was I heard the case I
it's<00:05:39.060> just<00:05:39.300> nothing<00:05:39.509> but<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:39.810> remembering

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
it's just nothing but a remembering

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.189 
it's just nothing but a remembering
right<00:05:40.560> after<00:05:41.250> all<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.580> do<00:05:41.759> you<00:05:41.849> think<00:05:42.199> there's

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
right after all is do you think there's

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.680
