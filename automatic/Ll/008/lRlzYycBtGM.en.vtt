were to press for submission and you

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410 
were to press for submission and you
direct<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> stick<00:00:29.880> towards<00:00:30.300> your

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
in as an attempt fork more it would

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.860 
in as an attempt fork more it would
never<00:00:35.070> come<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.120> reason<00:00:36.450> being<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
never come out the reason being that you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
never come out the reason being that you
cannot<00:00:37.170> successfully<00:00:37.559> attack<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.340> arm<00:00:38.550> and

cannot successfully attack that arm and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
cannot successfully attack that arm and
the<00:00:38.879> game<00:00:39.059> believe<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> arm

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the game believe that this is the arm

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.630 
the game believe that this is the arm
you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> attack<00:00:41.010> based<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you want to attack based on the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.119 
you want to attack based on the
direction<00:00:41.940> you've<00:00:42.210> entered<00:00:42.920> ultimately<00:00:43.920> you
