the changes that happen today not really
that<00:01:42.890> some<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> them<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.189> big<00:01:44.310> some<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.670> mine

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
that some of them are big some of mine

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.440 
that some of them are big some of mine
firstly<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.439> ground<00:01:46.799> zero<00:01:47.220> exploit<00:01:47.880> was

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
firstly that ground zero exploit was

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
firstly that ground zero exploit was
patched<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.649> why<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.860> uploaded<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
patched which is why I uploaded the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.450 
patched which is why I uploaded the
video<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> sir<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.950> probably<00:01:53.250> already

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
video on it sir you probably already

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.530 
video on it sir you probably already
knew<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:54.180> at<00:01:54.450> least<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.700> secondly<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
knew that one at least but secondly the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.399 
knew that one at least but secondly the
density<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> camber<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> regen<00:02:00.360> bloons<00:02:00.689> was

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
density of camber and regen bloons was

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.120 
density of camber and regen bloons was
nerfed<00:02:01.829> within<00:02:02.610> assault<00:02:03.409> assault<00:02:04.409> tiles<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
nerfed within assault assault tiles I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.920 
nerfed within assault assault tiles I
don't<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.689> affects

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
don't know that I think that affects

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.109 
don't know that I think that affects
monkey<00:02:07.229> versus<00:02:07.469> monkey<00:02:07.770> as<00:02:07.860> well<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.340> yeah

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
monkey versus monkey as well but yeah

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
monkey versus monkey as well but yeah
pretty<00:02:09.330> much<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.690> means<00:02:09.840> when<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
pretty much that means when you get a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.050 
pretty much that means when you get a
camera<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.550> region<00:02:12.239> assault

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
camera or region assault

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.780 
camera or region assault
then<00:02:13.540> there<00:02:13.930> won't<00:02:14.170> be<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.530> many<00:02:14.890> cameras<00:02:15.580> or

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
then there won't be as many cameras or

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.910 
then there won't be as many cameras or
regions<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.510> them<00:02:16.810> makes<00:02:17.319> them<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.560> little<00:02:17.590> bit

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
regions in them makes them a little bit

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.100 
regions in them makes them a little bit
easier<00:02:18.069> there's<00:02:18.940> still<00:02:19.239> going<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.690> lot

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
easier there's still going to be a lot

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.460 
easier there's still going to be a lot
of<00:02:20.140> them<00:02:20.530> Sir<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.660> build<00:02:22.989> for

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
of them Sir you do have to build for

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.979 
of them Sir you do have to build for
that<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.160> it's<00:02:24.610> not<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.540> harsh

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
that but it's not going to be so harsh

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.050 
that but it's not going to be so harsh
now<00:02:27.239> anyway<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.900> main<00:02:29.260> thing<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
now anyway the main thing is that the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.870 
now anyway the main thing is that the
cash<00:02:31.360> penalties<00:02:31.989> were<00:02:32.470> reduced<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.489> bit<00:02:33.519> so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
cash penalties were reduced a bit so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.509 
cash penalties were reduced a bit so
they're<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.450> harsh<00:02:34.780> on<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.280> mean

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
before you would hit a point where you'd

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.220 
before you would hit a point where you'd
pretty<00:02:39.790> much<00:02:39.880> got<00:02:40.180> no<00:02:40.420> money<00:02:40.690> at<00:02:40.870> all<00:02:40.959> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
pretty much got no money at all you

or something you get nothing and so you

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.720 
or something you get nothing and so you
pretty<00:02:49.780> much<00:02:49.900> didn't<00:02:50.530> build<00:02:50.769> any<00:02:51.040> more<00:02:51.340> towers

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
pretty much didn't build any more towers

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.990 
pretty much didn't build any more towers
after<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.569> certain<00:02:52.870> round<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.620> yeah<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.850> was

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
after a certain round and yeah that was

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.720 
after a certain round and yeah that was
I<00:02:55.239> mean<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.750> was<00:02:55.840> still<00:02:56.140> possible<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.830> play<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
I mean it was still possible to play and

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.570 
I mean it was still possible to play and
progress<00:02:58.209> really<00:02:58.780> far<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.709> could<00:02:59.860> do<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.489> you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
progress really far you could do it you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.320 
progress really far you could do it you
could<00:03:00.640> still<00:03:00.910> beat<00:03:01.239> any<00:03:01.480> tiles<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:03.549> you

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
could still beat any tiles it's just you

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.660 
could still beat any tiles it's just you
wouldn't<00:03:05.140> get<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.560> money<00:03:05.769> at<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> end<00:03:06.160> it

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
wouldn't get that money at the end it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.839 
wouldn't get that money at the end it
would<00:03:06.970> make<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.360> lot<00:03:07.390> slower<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.500> lot<00:03:09.160> lagiya

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
would make it a lot slower a lot lagiya

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.550 
would make it a lot slower a lot lagiya
because<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.569> can't<00:03:10.780> really<00:03:10.900> afford<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.380> get

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
because you can't really afford to get

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.660 
because you can't really afford to get
nice<00:03:11.769> clean<00:03:12.160> up<00:03:12.340> towers<00:03:12.959> serious<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:15.130> was<00:03:15.280> some

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
nice clean up towers serious it was some

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.819 
nice clean up towers serious it was some
more<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.910> a<00:03:16.000> quality<00:03:16.569> of<00:03:16.660> life<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.680> is

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
more of a quality of life in but it is

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
who were probably struggling a bit

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.550 
who were probably struggling a bit

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
struggling a bit i mean i struggled

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.630 
struggling a bit i mean i struggled
still<00:03:25.359> on<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.660> lot<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:25.930> tiles<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.620> lot<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.250> tarts

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
still on a lot of tiles a lot of tarts

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.400 
still on a lot of tiles a lot of tarts
and<00:03:28.230> this<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.410> very<00:03:29.709> helpful<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.280> me<00:03:30.430> as<00:03:30.700> well

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
and this is very helpful for me as well

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.030 
and this is very helpful for me as well
so<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:34.030> basically<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.870> now<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.890> at

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
so what this basically is now is that at

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.000 
so what this basically is now is that at
round<00:03:36.370> 14<00:03:37.060> there<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.109> fifty<00:03:38.680> percent

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
round 14 there is a fifty percent

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.360 
round 14 there is a fifty percent
reduction<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:40.359> cash<00:03:40.810> that<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.650> get<00:03:41.889> from<00:03:41.920> blue

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
reduction in cash that you get from blue

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.599 
reduction in cash that you get from blue
and<00:03:42.519> pops<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:43.889> pretty<00:03:44.889> much<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.160> pop<00:03:45.370> two

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
and pops so pretty much you pop two

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.059 
and pops so pretty much you pop two
balloons<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.269> get<00:03:46.450> one<00:03:46.750> cash<00:03:47.019> instead<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.859> one

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
balloons and get one cash instead of one

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.300 
balloons and get one cash instead of one
from<00:03:48.280> every<00:03:48.489> balloon<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.590> then<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.829> second

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
from every balloon and then the second

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.550 
from every balloon and then the second
hit<00:03:51.489> that<00:03:51.639> comes<00:03:51.910> in<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.299> on<00:03:52.480> round<00:03:52.720> 21<00:03:53.170> and

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
hit that comes in is on round 21 and

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.509 
hit that comes in is on round 21 and
that<00:03:54.400> jumps<00:03:54.910> up<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.299> an<00:03:55.420> 80%<00:03:56.290> eighty<00:03:57.250> percent

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
that jumps up to an 80% eighty percent

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.129 
that jumps up to an 80% eighty percent
cut<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.139> have<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.470> pop<00:03:59.650> think<00:04:00.720> was<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.900> four

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
cut so you have to pop think was it four

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.870 
cut so you have to pop think was it four
or<00:04:02.290> five<00:04:02.530> balloons<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.340> get<00:04:03.459> one<00:04:03.639> cash

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
or five balloons to get one cash

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.190 
or five balloons to get one cash
something<00:04:04.269> like<00:04:04.389> that

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
something like that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.009 
something like that
yeah<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.560> then<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.519> next<00:04:07.549> one<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.360> on<00:04:08.569> rounds

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
yeah and then the next one is on rounds

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.039 
yeah and then the next one is on rounds
26<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:10.129> that<00:04:10.579> jumps<00:04:11.120> up<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:12.670> very<00:04:13.670> high

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
26 and that jumps up to a very high

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.289 
26 and that jumps up to a very high
ninety-five<00:04:15.049> percent<00:04:15.319> cut<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.549> you're<00:04:17.180> only

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
ninety-five percent cut so you're only

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.199 
ninety-five percent cut so you're only
getting<00:04:17.690> five<00:04:18.470> percent<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.459> one<00:04:19.669> yeah<00:04:20.000> that

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
getting five percent that one yeah that

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.390 
getting five percent that one yeah that
one<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.810> need<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.049> pop<00:04:21.229> 20<00:04:21.650> balloons<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.220> get

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
one you need to pop 20 balloons to get

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.029 
one you need to pop 20 balloons to get
one<00:04:22.639> cash<00:04:22.940> by<00:04:23.210> that<00:04:23.389> point<00:04:23.650> but<00:04:24.650> it's<00:04:24.860> actually

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
one cash by that point but it's actually

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.510 
one cash by that point but it's actually
it<00:04:25.820> sounds<00:04:26.150> pretty<00:04:26.810> heavy<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.650> mean<00:04:27.979> when<00:04:28.400> you

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
it sounds pretty heavy I mean when you

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.770 
it sounds pretty heavy I mean when you
think<00:04:28.550> about<00:04:28.759> a<00:04:28.940> ninety-five<00:04:29.539> percent

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
think about a ninety-five percent

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.070 
think about a ninety-five percent
reduction<00:04:30.110> in<00:04:30.560> cash<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.280> get<00:04:31.490> from<00:04:31.520> pops

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
reduction in cash that you get from pops

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.020 
reduction in cash that you get from pops
that<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.350> be<00:04:33.530> completely<00:04:34.250> honest<00:04:34.639> it<00:04:34.820> was<00:04:35.000> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
that to be completely honest it was a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.300 
that to be completely honest it was a
lot<00:04:35.449> worse<00:04:35.479> before<00:04:35.960> Anna<00:04:36.560> days<00:04:36.830> actually<00:04:37.130> I

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
lot worse before Anna days actually I

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.310 
lot worse before Anna days actually I
think<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.880> actually<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.539> a<00:04:38.630> lot<00:04:39.139> better

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
think it actually is in a lot better

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.150 
think it actually is in a lot better
spot<00:04:39.740> now<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.280> would<00:04:41.180> prefer<00:04:41.419> for<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.949> be<00:04:43.130> a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
spot now I would prefer for it to be a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.060 
spot now I would prefer for it to be a
more<00:04:43.699> like<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.600> more<00:04:45.139> of<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.320> slope<00:04:45.620> instead<00:04:46.010> of

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
more like a more of a slope instead of

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.920 
more like a more of a slope instead of
this<00:04:46.160> jump<00:04:46.550> over<00:04:46.789> now<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:46.970> then<00:04:47.240> like<00:04:47.660> instead

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
this jump over now and then like instead

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.469 
this jump over now and then like instead
of<00:04:48.139> having<00:04:48.380> one<00:04:48.500> on<00:04:48.770> round<00:04:49.039> 14<00:04:49.520> one<00:04:49.760> around<00:04:50.000> 21

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
of having one on round 14 one around 21

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.870 
of having one on round 14 one around 21
running<00:04:50.720> around<00:04:50.960> 26<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.770> personally<00:04:52.729> think

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
running around 26 I personally think

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.820 
running around 26 I personally think
there<00:04:53.090> should<00:04:53.240> be<00:04:53.270> one<00:04:53.600> every<00:04:54.139> single<00:04:54.380> round

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
there should be one every single round

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.089 
there should be one every single round
after<00:04:55.430> round<00:04:55.460> 14<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.229> should<00:04:57.470> be<00:04:57.650> a<00:04:57.680> nice

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
after round 14 but it should be a nice

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.540 
after round 14 but it should be a nice
small<00:04:58.849> cut<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.570> you've<00:04:59.720> got<00:04:59.750> this<00:04:59.930> slope

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
small cut so you've got this slope

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.219 
small cut so you've got this slope
instead<00:05:01.550> of<00:05:01.580> feeling<00:05:01.940> this<00:05:02.180> giant<00:05:02.690> hit<00:05:02.930> every

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
instead of feeling this giant hit every

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.820 
instead of feeling this giant hit every
now<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.560> then<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:04.810> whatever<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:06.110> works<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.710> lot

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
now and then but whatever it works a lot

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.930 
now and then but whatever it works a lot
better<00:05:06.889> now<00:05:07.310> sir<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:09.470> can<00:05:09.650> beat<00:05:10.010> tiles<00:05:10.340> easier

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
better now sir you can beat tiles easier

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.550 
better now sir you can beat tiles easier
but<00:05:11.270> it's<00:05:11.510> not<00:05:11.660> really<00:05:11.930> it's<00:05:12.440> not<00:05:12.470> really

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
but it's not really it's not really

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.290 
but it's not really it's not really
helping<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:13.039> be<00:05:13.160> tails<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.639> that<00:05:13.789> much<00:05:14.000> easier

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
helping you be tails of that much easier

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.810 
helping you be tails of that much easier
because<00:05:15.169> it's<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.830> beginning<00:05:16.010> that's<00:05:16.550> really

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
because it's the beginning that's really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.730 
because it's the beginning that's really
the<00:05:16.910> issue<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.810> always<00:05:18.169> has<00:05:18.410> been<00:05:18.440> the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
the issue it always has been the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.439 
the issue it always has been the
beginning<00:05:19.220> like<00:05:19.370> getting<00:05:19.669> set<00:05:19.970> up<00:05:20.000> what's<00:05:20.330> the

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
beginning like getting set up what's the

beginning like getting set up what's the
issue<00:05:20.599> for<00:05:21.020> me<00:05:21.169> at<00:05:21.289> least<00:05:21.320> oh<00:05:22.780> yeah<00:05:23.780> pretty

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
issue for me at least oh yeah pretty

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.520 
issue for me at least oh yeah pretty
much<00:05:24.289> but<00:05:25.120> it's<00:05:26.120> it's<00:05:26.599> definitely<00:05:27.169> helping

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
much but it's it's definitely helping

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.649 
much but it's it's definitely helping
you<00:05:27.650> at<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.889> end<00:05:28.070> with<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.729> getting<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:29.510> can

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
you at the end with that getting you can

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.180 
you at the end with that getting you can
actually<00:05:29.900> afford<00:05:30.169> to<00:05:30.349> get<00:05:30.470> a<00:05:30.500> few<00:05:30.680> cleanup

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
actually afford to get a few cleanup

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.270 
actually afford to get a few cleanup
towers<00:05:31.580> down<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:32.180> like<00:05:32.659> just<00:05:33.099> scrape<00:05:34.099> out

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
towers down to like just scrape out

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.180 
towers down to like just scrape out
those<00:05:34.520> mobs<00:05:34.849> a<00:05:35.030> bit<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.500> reduce<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.770> lag

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
those mobs a bit and reduce that lag

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.260 
those mobs a bit and reduce that lag
because<00:05:38.260> lag<00:05:39.260> is<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.620> heavy<00:05:40.250> issue<00:05:40.550> here<00:05:41.120> I'm

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
because lag is a heavy issue here I'm

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.320 
because lag is a heavy issue here I'm
like<00:05:41.870> in<00:05:42.169> just<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.740> bloons<00:05:43.039> game<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:44.060> balloons

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
like in just a bloons game the balloons

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.360 
like in just a bloons game the balloons
to<00:05:44.479> elephants<00:05:44.840> 5<00:05:45.020> gameplay<00:05:45.409> grounds<00:05:46.130> one<00:05:46.340> to

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
to elephants 5 gameplay grounds one to

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.860 
to elephants 5 gameplay grounds one to
85<00:05:46.940> if<00:05:47.060> you're<00:05:47.180> not<00:05:47.270> really<00:05:47.389> going<00:05:47.659> to<00:05:47.720> get

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
85 if you're not really going to get

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.750 
85 if you're not really going to get
that<00:05:48.050> much<00:05:48.320> lag<00:05:48.650> but<00:05:49.340> when<00:05:49.460> you're<00:05:49.580> playing

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
that much lag but when you're playing

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.420 
that much lag but when you're playing
around<00:05:50.060> 12<00:05:50.570> 30<00:05:50.840> in<00:05:51.080> blends<00:05:51.320> boogie<00:05:51.650> City<00:05:51.830> it's

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
around 12 30 in blends boogie City it's

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.790 
around 12 30 in blends boogie City it's
the<00:05:52.580> equivalent<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.449> going<00:05:53.690> into<00:05:54.169> free<00:05:54.560> play<00:05:54.770> a

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
the equivalent of going into free play a

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.550 
the equivalent of going into free play a
little<00:05:55.010> bit<00:05:55.280> in<00:05:55.490> that's<00:05:56.389> Mike<00:05:56.599> influenced<00:05:57.470> a

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
little bit in that's Mike influenced a

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.589 
little bit in that's Mike influenced a
defense<00:05:57.800> 5<00:05:58.210> so<00:05:59.210> in<00:06:00.070> much<00:06:01.070> less<00:06:01.340> like<00:06:01.610> one<00:06:02.210> third

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
defense 5 so in much less like one third

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.649 
defense 5 so in much less like one third
of<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.930> rounds<00:06:03.440> you're<00:06:03.800> getting<00:06:04.360> but<00:06:05.360> what

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
of the rounds you're getting but what

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.300 
of the rounds you're getting but what
were<00:06:05.780> actually<00:06:05.930> more<00:06:06.260> like<00:06:06.349> 150<00:06:06.979> rounds
