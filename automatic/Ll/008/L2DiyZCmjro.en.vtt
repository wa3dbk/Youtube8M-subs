00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
best mineral powder foundation that I've

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
best mineral powder foundation that I've
ever<00:00:27.570> tried<00:00:27.900> I've<00:00:28.109> tried<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.560> couple<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
ever tried I've tried a couple and I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
ever tried I've tried a couple and I
think<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> best<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:32.070> problem

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
think it's the best one the only problem

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
think it's the best one the only problem
I<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.210> can't<00:00:33.510> find<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I have with it is that I can't find a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
I have with it is that I can't find a
color<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.770> fits<00:00:35.130> me<00:00:35.399> perfectly<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.270> have

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
color that fits me perfectly so I have

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.970

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
other ones but i don't think they're

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.080 
other ones but i don't think they're
really<00:05:42.590> my<00:05:42.889> top<00:05:43.160> favorites<00:05:43.669> these<00:05:43.880> are<00:05:44.000> the

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
really my top favorites these are the

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.850 
really my top favorites these are the
ones<00:05:44.330> that<00:05:44.450> i<00:05:44.539> really<00:05:44.900> liked<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.350> stuck<00:05:45.680> two

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
ones that i really liked and stuck two

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.310 
ones that i really liked and stuck two
and<00:05:46.010> a<00:05:46.100> half<00:05:46.220> continue<00:05:46.820> to<00:05:47.090> buy<00:05:47.270> so<00:05:48.169> i<00:05:48.200> think

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
and a half continue to buy so i think

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.870 
and a half continue to buy so i think
this<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.680> probably<00:05:49.039> going<00:05:49.280> to<00:05:49.340> be<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.639> last
