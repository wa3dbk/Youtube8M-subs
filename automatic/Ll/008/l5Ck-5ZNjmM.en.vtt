00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.160
 good morning and well arrived in the kitchen 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.570
 of the world I say the world of ox a place 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.970
 magical where children can 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 rediscover the affective educational value 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.689
 but above all fun to put on 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.849
 hands in dough 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.680
 I'm the helper of this 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.410
 funny little animal with long ears 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.699
 and the giant smile he teaches to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.280
 children to cook in this kitchen 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:38.640
 magical things happen because why 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.970
 let's learn with our hands to do 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.550
 of the recipes in which and the ingredients 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.920
 they know good and above all they smell good 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 at home the children here do everything from 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.089
 only followed by me and hbo and then le 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 their little hands are able to create things 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.610
 magic almost equal and therefore will have to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 marry great chefs and grown-ups 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.239
 confectioners 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.030
 I always say then the tummy goes 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.710
 filled with good things but above all 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.729
 happy thoughts and in this kitchen 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.590
 this magic happens as it works well 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.890
 then the children are accompanied 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.469
 from parents who are banned from this 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.689
 kitchen are fully dressed 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.560
 with the aprons sewn from mine 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.479
 little hands with handkerchiefs on their heads for the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 girls put on more charmingly 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.300
 while the boys year 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 they look like the few Japanese and therefore 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.770
 they are much more loaded when they mix 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.360
 mix mix the ingredients and then 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.850
 let's start first I prepare the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.600
 table that welcomes small bugs then 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.790
 every child fully dressed 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.180
 will ask if these chairs are in front 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.060
 at his post and in front of this 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.830
 location we will put tools 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.780
 magic then we need them first 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.509
 of the inept lands in the Terinese area 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.700
 colored inside which then 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.209
 we will put the ingredients that mine 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.910
 ebook 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.830
 we have chosen for the recipe of the day 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.320
 and then we take the ladles that yes 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.200
 they serve as blenders then here at 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.900
 world of bu we do everything with our hands and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.570
 so we have to inter there is a lot of strength e 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.580
 much energy in mixing then when 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.660
 we are tired we rest we talk a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.050
 little of how the day went 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.440
 school of which are ours 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.180
 ideas for holidays for example and then i 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.180
 kids has a lot of secrets that me 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.950
 they tell you but I don't tell you then 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.510
 and then we also put rolling pins 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.080
 why then roll out the pasta or pasta 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.010
 shortcrust is a beautiful thing exceptional 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.870
 then we have finished and ladles 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.710
 rates are missing ingredients like 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.710
 ingredients we can choose the flour 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.970
 which can be of various colors 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.580
 I always explain that behind every 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.410
 ingredient there is a different magic ea 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.560
 depending on that ingredient the recipe 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.080
 will one way or place another but 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.060
 absolutely the most beautiful ingredient 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.660
 for children 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:30.540
 guess which eggs are the eggs 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.650
 they are the most exciting thing to do 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.030
 because at home they break very rarely 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.620
 because mom may be afraid that she is 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.110
 dirty the kitchen that get dirty i 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.120
 dresses and then here in the bus world 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.280
 we are free to experiment 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.850
 experimental perfumed beautiful things e 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.590
 even a little bit sticky sometimes though 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.500
 then we have cooking secrets 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.750
 because v has a special technique with the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.750
 which eggs can be broken without 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.510
 slide them off the table then 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.080
 we do n't have naughty eggs in ours 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.530
 kitchen 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.489
 so we have eggs and flour now 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:12.890
 take the sugar then the sugar 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:18.950
 it can be dark or it is clear 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:22.160
 and as a last ingredient we lose 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.980
 something crunched the nuts that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.140
 this season they are very very good 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.450
 of course I am the one helping the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.360
 children to break the wedding though 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.590
 sometimes they are better at chin in 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.430
 kitchen now just missing one 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.020
 pinch of sweetness of children when 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.940
 the labs are always hungry 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.040
 then all these perfumes put 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.610
 appetite so in the meantime I have 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.980
 prepared sweets and with sweetness vi 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.140
 I also say to sit outside because i 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.880
 children are coming and then I don't 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.190
 it remains to tell you a sentence that I say 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.470
 often in my labs and if happy 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.010
 you want to become the wall of you come to 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.010
