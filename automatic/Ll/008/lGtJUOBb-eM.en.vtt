00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.380
 gold 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.230
 hello to tell you what they want I 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
 am williams is today for my 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.860
 first salty video of my summer series 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 I will show you how to make 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.700
 traditional coleslaw so this is a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.720
 extraordinary American salad based 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.580
 carrot sprouts 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 it's easy to find in France it's 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.360
 I do not like it and when you 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.040
 do it yourself it's amazing 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 much less remember that I 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.080
 hate in school except that in between 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.820
 trade 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.040
 in any case you will see is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.140
 this very simple authentic wave is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 really delicious 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.900
 so for our cause we will have 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
 already need for the vegetables part of which 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.270
 of a green cabbage that is inside 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 white here this one is a kilo are 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.110
 so he's pretty big tits I'm going 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.970
 do a lot of posts 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.130
 today here g of carrots 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.590
 I have almost 300 grams that I have 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.160
 peeled and then I had to cut out 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.430
 extremities 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 then for the sauce so typical of a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.040
 col what we will need from two 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.060
 light net jerseys which I use this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.649
 will be having too many calories our 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.539
 poles uses the mayonnaise bail 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.670
 lighten up I have 130 grams 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.549
 I have a tablespoon of vinegar 2 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.799
 - a tablespoon of mustard 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.470
 dijon and 2 tablespoons yoghurt 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.940
 Greek to clarify a little while 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.830
 giving us a tablespoon of juice 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.479
 lemon of salt and pepper and 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.369
 normally it will be all or not 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.479
 Africa indeed initialed my carrots 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.520
 to household robots 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.770
 then for cabbage foot actually we 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.860
 let's cut it to just 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.490
 like this I like to remove leaves 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.490
 external 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.939
 so as you can see here we have the 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.840
 heart of cabbage but that I do not doubt 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.479
 what I can do is everything 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.979
 simply remove it with a knife 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.079
 paying attention to especially not a 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.720
 blow that still and then what I 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.340
 will make this cut and so 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.259
 lengths of them 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.420
 days then simply rap and 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.369
 as I do with the carole so 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.610
 like this you add the pieces 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.410
 that they will have anyway in your 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.330
 household robot the adapt you with this 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.800
 that you have and then we will be able to 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.640
 tackle the source of our post 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 lomÃ© to the assembly 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.430
 here then tubes and vegetables seemed 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.849
 remember I really have a quantity 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.670
 huge surely must forget everything but 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.739
 amount of sauce since the aca is not going 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.730
 do enough I think so that's what 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.540
 I'm just doing it is that I 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.640
 mix all the ingredients for my 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.069
 sauce I will also add my juice 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.610
 lemon I'm going to salt and pepper 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.720
 also my sauce and then I'm going 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.890
 surely double it for then 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.599
 add it to my vegetables 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.910
 So here I have my sauce 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.379
 closely doubled the proportion accounts so 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.299
 that I gave you at the very beginning of 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.730
 the video because I did not think so much 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.150
 coleslaw knew how to do it 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.040
 to add my stuff kind of add 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.340
 at progressively until 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.510
 all but as soon as I am well 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.150
 coated with sow seems to have without having 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.130
 too much since after too much on the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.569
 talk about water so what I do is 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.310
 that I add my sauce that I mix 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.549
 like these is then I show you 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.019
 the result 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.980
 so as you can see my cosmo 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.420
 is wonderful 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.940
 there the noise alone describes everything 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.099
 it's just not perfect so it's 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.959
 great I do not have too much sauce so me 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.160

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.019
 I call a piece of commerce and 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.549
 that there is way too much sauce and 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.470
 Too much vinegar for my taste 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.299
