00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
as you can see why with some gasket

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.769 
as you can see why with some gasket
material<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.920> yeah<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.220> also<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.420> make<00:00:21.600> your

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
material and yeah and also you make your

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.450 
material and yeah and also you make your
own<00:00:21.810> gasket<00:00:22.260> stuff<00:00:22.619> should<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.310> that

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
own gasket stuff should we go do that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.310 
own gasket stuff should we go do that
now<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.420> got<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> tighten<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
now I just got to tighten up I got a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.140 
now I just got to tighten up I got a
brand<00:00:25.560> new<00:00:25.619> bolt<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.400> put<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:26.880> and

brand new bolt to put in there and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.109 
brand new bolt to put in there and
hopefully<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.320> will<00:00:28.439> stop<00:00:29.119> backfiring

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
hopefully this will stop backfiring
