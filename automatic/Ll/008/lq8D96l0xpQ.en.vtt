of the microscopic bad guys the human
body<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.940> lot<00:01:08.210> like<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.479> building<00:01:09.049> where

ourselves our rooms viruses infect us by

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.490 
ourselves our rooms viruses infect us by
breaking<00:01:13.640> an<00:01:13.820> injury<00:01:16.900> so<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:17.990> might<00:01:18.170> ask<00:01:18.320> me

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
breaking an injury so you might ask me

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.469 
breaking an injury so you might ask me
why<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.340> little<00:01:19.700> room<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.420> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
why it is this little room and the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.600 
why it is this little room and the
storage<00:01:20.750> facility<00:01:20.869> have<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.710> lock<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
storage facility have a lock and so the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.130 
storage facility have a lock and so the
answer<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:22.909> obvious<00:01:23.360> because<00:01:23.540> somebody<00:01:23.960> needs

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
answer is obvious because somebody needs

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.200 
answer is obvious because somebody needs
to<00:01:24.290> go<00:01:24.439> in<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.710> out<00:01:24.799> this<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.580> an<00:01:25.790> attempt<00:01:26.090> to

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
to go in and out this is an attempt to

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.390 
to go in and out this is an attempt to
secure<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.380> entrance<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.100> only<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
secure the entrance so that only the
