00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
that on the one so if we're playing the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
that on the one so if we're playing the
one<00:01:56.550> here<00:01:57.890> play<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.070> chord<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.530> then<00:02:01.530> we're

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
one here play this chord and then we're

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.990 
one here play this chord and then we're
going<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.830> play<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.070> bass<00:02:02.369> note<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.790> here

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
going to play this bass note down here

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:14.440 
going to play this bass note down here
so<00:02:03.180> we're<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> go

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.050 

No

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:31.750 

you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.910 

so<00:02:32.760> if<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.940> heard<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.720> note<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.290> C<00:02:34.680> was

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so if you heard that see note that C was

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
so if you heard that see note that C was
you<00:02:35.100> know<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.400> pretty<00:02:35.640> low<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.570> don't

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
you know it was pretty low so I don't

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.240 
you know it was pretty low so I don't
know<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.960> would<00:02:37.110> do<00:02:37.200> both<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> those<00:02:37.740> C's<00:02:38.040> at

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
know if I would do both of those C's at

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.770 
know if I would do both of those C's at
the<00:02:38.310> bottom<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> D<00:02:38.970> sounded<00:02:39.360> pretty<00:02:39.480> good

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the bottom but the D sounded pretty good

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.930 
the bottom but the D sounded pretty good
but<00:02:40.470> what<00:02:40.890> you'll<00:02:41.010> notice<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.760> gives

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
but what you'll notice is it just gives

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.820 
but what you'll notice is it just gives
you<00:02:42.000> like<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.210> ton<00:02:42.690> more<00:02:42.930> power<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.470> your<00:02:43.560> plane

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
you like a ton more power in your plane

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.160 
you like a ton more power in your plane
so<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.520> know<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.060> I'll<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.210> be<00:02:45.450> plain<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:45.900> if

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so you know it I'll just be plain so if

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.230 
so you know it I'll just be plain so if
I<00:02:46.320> was<00:02:46.500> doing<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.860> in<00:02:46.920> my<00:02:47.190> solo<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.820> would

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
I was doing this in my solo I would

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.330 
I was doing this in my solo I would
probably<00:02:48.660> be<00:02:48.750> playing<00:02:49.020> like<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.410> I'll<00:02:50.070> be

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
probably be playing like this I'll be

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.640 
probably be playing like this I'll be
playing<00:02:50.580> four<00:02:51.000> beats<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.540> chord<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:52.560> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
playing four beats for the chord then I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.740 
playing four beats for the chord then I
would<00:02:52.770> go<00:02:52.980> down<00:02:53.190> play<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.790> bass<00:02:53.970> note<00:02:54.240> then

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
would go down play the bass note then

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.530 
would go down play the bass note then
finish<00:02:55.230> three<00:02:56.040> more<00:02:56.250> beats<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.330> would

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
finish three more beats and then I would

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.420 
finish three more beats and then I would
change<00:02:57.720> chords<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.040> was<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.220> illustrate

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
change chords so if I was to illustrate

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.449 
change chords so if I was to illustrate
that<00:02:59.730> so<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.000> would<00:03:00.150> go<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:00.780> two<00:03:01.650> three<00:03:04.459> two

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
that so I would go one two three two

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:14.470 
that so I would go one two three two
three<00:03:05.870> four<00:03:06.870> change<00:03:07.800> chords<00:03:08.489> two<00:03:09.060> three<00:03:10.050> four

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:04:01.500 

change<00:03:14.900> chords

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.670 

so<00:04:02.510> that's<00:04:02.720> what<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.900> would<00:04:02.960> play<00:04:03.200> if<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:03.410> wanted

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
so that's what I would play if I wanted

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.590 
so that's what I would play if I wanted
to<00:04:03.770> just<00:04:03.950> give<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.250> lot<00:04:04.550> more<00:04:04.730> power<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.300> you

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
to just give it a lot more power and you

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.510 
to just give it a lot more power and you
saw<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.960> went<00:04:06.140> four<00:04:06.560> chords<00:04:06.980> one<00:04:07.160> two

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
saw that I went four chords one two

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.220 
saw that I went four chords one two
three<00:04:08.090> four<00:04:08.630> BAM<00:04:09.650> two<00:04:10.490> three<00:04:11.180> four<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:11.690> then<00:04:12.110> I

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
three four BAM two three four and then I

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.650 
three four BAM two three four and then I
change<00:04:12.560> chords<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:13.970> was<00:04:14.120> just<00:04:14.270> soloing<00:04:14.570> in

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.170 
change chords and I was just soloing in
the<00:04:14.750> C<00:04:14.930> pentatonic<00:04:15.560> with<00:04:15.680> my<00:04:15.800> right<00:04:16.010> hand<00:04:16.280> now

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
the C pentatonic with my right hand now

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.700 
the C pentatonic with my right hand now
the<00:04:17.300> last<00:04:17.570> thing<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:18.020> can<00:04:18.200> do<00:04:18.350> with<00:04:18.470> bass

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710 
the last thing that you can do with bass

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.950 
the last thing that you can do with bass
notes<00:04:19.010> that<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.489> think<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.000> really<00:04:20.480> awesome<00:04:20.660> and

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
notes that I think is really awesome and

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.960 
notes that I think is really awesome and
I<00:04:21.080> kind<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.470> do<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:21.710> to<00:04:21.860> play<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.250> like

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
I kind of do this to play it like like

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.820 
I kind of do this to play it like like
in<00:04:23.090> more<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.360> bossa<00:04:23.660> nova<00:04:23.870> style<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.590> plane

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
in more of a bossa nova style of plane

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.060 
in more of a bossa nova style of plane
which<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.520> just<00:04:25.700> like<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> like<00:04:26.420> a<00:04:26.450> Latin<00:04:27.070> Latin

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
which is just like a like a Latin Latin

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.500 
which is just like a like a Latin Latin
groove<00:04:28.280> like<00:04:28.520> you'll<00:04:28.760> totally<00:04:29.030> know<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.420> if

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
groove like you'll totally know it if

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.150 
groove like you'll totally know it if
you<00:04:29.570> hear<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.870> so<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.230> is<00:04:30.290> what<00:04:30.500> bossa<00:04:30.740> nova'
