they're<00:02:11.629> that<00:02:11.659> small<00:02:12.260> then<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.769> think<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.069> have<00:02:13.250> a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
they're that small then I think I have a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.589 
they're that small then I think I have a
chance

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.600 

keep<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.690> baseball<00:02:17.230> bat<00:02:17.470> by<00:02:17.740> your<00:02:17.950> beds<00:02:18.190> yeah

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
keep a baseball bat by your beds yeah

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.729 
keep a baseball bat by your beds yeah
but<00:02:18.910> no<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.450> thing<00:02:19.989> that<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.260> wonder<00:02:20.560> about<00:02:20.650> is

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
but no the thing that I wonder about is

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.530 
but no the thing that I wonder about is
hypnosis<00:02:21.190> do<00:02:21.459> you<00:02:21.550> buy<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.700> hypnosis<00:02:22.150> thing

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
hypnosis do you buy the hypnosis thing

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.910 
hypnosis do you buy the hypnosis thing
because<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.200> mean<00:02:23.970> hypnosis<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:26.319> should

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
because I mean hypnosis is a this should

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.460 
because I mean hypnosis is a this should
be<00:02:27.069> used<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.640> great<00:02:28.000> caution<00:02:28.720> because<00:02:29.200> of

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
be used with great caution because of

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.110 
be used with great caution because of
the<00:02:29.560> power<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.980> suggestion<00:02:30.400> there<00:02:30.700> are<00:02:30.760> many

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
the power of suggestion there are many

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.630 
the power of suggestion there are many
people<00:02:31.480> right<00:02:31.660> now<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:32.110> field<00:02:32.470> who<00:02:33.250> have

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
people right now in this field who have

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.880 
people right now in this field who have
this<00:02:33.819> idea<00:02:34.060> they<00:02:34.630> are<00:02:34.720> already<00:02:34.989> convinced<00:02:35.590> of

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
this idea they are already convinced of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680 
this idea they are already convinced of
a<00:02:35.980> certain<00:02:36.340> theory<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.239> know<00:02:37.270> these<00:02:37.630> are

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
a certain theory you know these are

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.140 
a certain theory you know these are
aliens<00:02:38.319> from<00:02:38.500> outer<00:02:38.680> space<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.250> they<00:02:39.850> project

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
aliens from outer space and they project

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.750 
aliens from outer space and they project
this<00:02:40.630> onto<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.650> people<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.130> they<00:02:42.250> hypnotize

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
this onto the people that they hypnotize

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.610 
this onto the people that they hypnotize
I<00:02:42.970> think<00:02:43.180> that's<00:02:43.330> very<00:02:43.420> dangerous<00:02:43.810> but<00:02:44.470> then

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
I think that's very dangerous but then

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.259 
I think that's very dangerous but then
again<00:02:44.860> if<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.519> don't<00:02:45.760> believe<00:02:46.000> in<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
again if you don't believe in the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.820 
again if you don't believe in the
hypnosis<00:02:46.600> part<00:02:47.019> or<00:02:47.110> if<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.440> know<00:02:47.560> your<00:02:47.709> kind

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
hypnosis part or if you know your kind

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.140 
hypnosis part or if you know your kind
of<00:02:47.950> skeptical<00:02:48.220> then<00:02:48.670> how<00:02:48.850> would<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> explain

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
of skeptical then how would you explain

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.559 
of skeptical then how would you explain
physical<00:02:49.959> marks<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.380> his<00:02:50.500> body<00:02:50.790> I'm<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
physical marks on his body I'm not you

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.750 
physical marks on his body I'm not you
know<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.720> wish<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.319> answer<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.280> we

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
know I wish I have the answer but if we

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.210 
know I wish I have the answer but if we
had<00:02:55.000> been<00:02:55.840> talking<00:02:56.110> 20<00:02:56.560> years<00:02:56.739> ago<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.069> would

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
had been talking 20 years ago I would

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.160 
had been talking 20 years ago I would
have<00:02:57.250> said<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.170> extraterrestrial

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
have said the extraterrestrial

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.680 
have said the extraterrestrial
explanation<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.890> the<00:03:00.010> best<00:03:00.220> one<00:03:00.430> today<00:03:01.390> with

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
explanation is the best one today with

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.180 
explanation is the best one today with
the<00:03:01.780> kind<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.080> evidence<00:03:02.319> we<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.799> it's<00:03:02.980> not

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
the kind of evidence we have it's not

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.160 
the kind of evidence we have it's not
necessarily<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.880> best<00:03:04.090> one<00:03:04.420> there<00:03:04.959> may<00:03:05.140> be

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
necessarily the best one there may be

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.020 
necessarily the best one there may be
other<00:03:05.440> forms<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.860> consciousness<00:03:06.459> right<00:03:06.670> here

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
other forms of consciousness right here

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.520 
other forms of consciousness right here
and<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.209> was<00:03:07.420> said<00:03:07.660> before<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.260> know<00:03:08.350> there

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
and this was said before you know there

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.190 
and this was said before you know there
may<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.730> parallel<00:03:09.730> universes<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.049> all

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
may be parallel universes this is all

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.320 
may be parallel universes this is all
valid<00:03:11.590> speculation<00:03:12.280> yeah<00:03:12.549> it<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.819> speculation

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
valid speculation yeah it is speculation

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.270 
valid speculation yeah it is speculation
but<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.780> valid<00:03:14.140> speculation<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:14.890> science

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
but it's valid speculation in science

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.190 
but it's valid speculation in science
today<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.910> marina<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.690> said<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.019> you

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
just was doing the denial thing I just

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.289 
just was doing the denial thing I just
just<00:03:27.220> ignoring<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.700> things<00:03:27.880> were<00:03:27.970> happened

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
just ignoring the things were happened

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.610 
just ignoring the things were happened
then<00:03:28.390> my<00:03:28.510> daughter<00:03:28.750> my<00:03:28.989> young<00:03:29.170> daughter<00:03:29.320> came

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
to me and told me something that just

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.630 
to me and told me something that just
she<00:03:32.560> couldn't<00:03:32.859> have<00:03:32.950> made<00:03:33.070> up<00:03:33.250> because<00:03:33.519> I

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
she couldn't have made up because I

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.979 
she couldn't have made up because I
wasn't<00:03:34.000> talking<00:03:34.329> about<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.690> at<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.840> point

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
wasn't talking about it at that point

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.920 
wasn't talking about it at that point
and<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:36.340> found<00:03:36.640> out<00:03:36.790> later<00:03:36.850> that<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.299> was<00:03:37.450> just

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
and I found out later that it was just

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.090 
and I found out later that it was just
almost<00:03:38.790> boilerplate<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:40.859> what<00:03:41.859> I've<00:03:41.980> heard

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
almost boilerplate to what I've heard

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.710 
almost boilerplate to what I've heard
from<00:03:42.250> other<00:03:42.370> people<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:43.030> at<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.359> point<00:03:43.570> I

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
from other people and at that point I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.810 
from other people and at that point I
said<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.140> gotta<00:03:44.650> be<00:03:44.769> mommy<00:03:44.950> and<00:03:45.130> go<00:03:45.220> find<00:03:45.459> out<00:03:45.640> it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
said I gotta be mommy and go find out it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.789 
said I gotta be mommy and go find out it
because<00:03:46.450> my<00:03:46.780> heart<00:03:46.900> froze<00:03:47.170> when<00:03:47.380> she<00:03:47.530> told<00:03:47.650> me

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
because my heart froze when she told me

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.349 
because my heart froze when she told me
that<00:03:47.829> I'm<00:03:48.040> mommy<00:03:48.280> I'm<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.519> she<00:03:48.790> when<00:03:49.000> she<00:03:49.030> said
