00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.240
 cheap duck 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 day 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.770
 one friends people an agent let's go to 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.030
 keep looking houses long ago 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.440
 I do not upload this type of videos and 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.420
 booksellers who eat you will have been a 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.189
 little bit the case is that today I bring 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.770
 a house of subscribers which is 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.349
 maxi game 365 you have a description by 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.700
 if you want and it's a house 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.840
 almost automatic to automatic outside 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.730
 the truth that is not very attractive has 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.470
 changed a little bit on the outside 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.480
 above yes I like it very much if you 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.770
 you see how good is logically I think 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.540
 that looks pretty is made in 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.010
 creative the truth that to do this in 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.870
 about 'it would take us a long time 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.629
 what to get which cited this topic 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.289
 but well there you see also a stable 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.480
 good 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:52.000
 there you see animals a donkey cows 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.559
 Little pigs for a lot of total little things 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.850
 this we will see now do not worry 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.899
 but let's start with the door to 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.879
 logically we have to go step by step 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.219
 teaching is the house and what I like 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.870
 of this house that is also as I said 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.879
 the boy in the message that is that is 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 automated is a house where a 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.420
 lots of reston things what thing I 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.520
 like it because you do not usually find many 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.620
 houses with remains and good let's go 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.450
 to the bathroom and the first thing the first if 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.370
 the first thing against this that we 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 we kill is this this the only thing that we 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.640
 does is turn on and off the light and with 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.030
 This is what we do with the shower 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.010
 you see it 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.229
 with this we can download these two and with 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.760
 we're going down this shower like now 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.159
 we left the room in the dark for 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.360
 nights to save energy and good 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.000
 although we have around here we have 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.229
 a normal room and here 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.659
 it helps us to turn off the light and power 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.130
 sleep peacefully without no lights here 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.740
 we have a chest with diamonds I want 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.140
 remember and here we have our 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.509
 chest with little things since under water I will 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.890
 remove this so that it does not bother us and 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.320
 let's continue to see the emptiness as you see 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.369
 good to see is the 13 not bad enough 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.990
 explain them how it's done because 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.440
 you see good I think it looks pretty good 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.000
 that is made with both quartz fit 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.770
 sincere I think it's called as a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.539
 normal quartz with lots of lamps 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.429
 of reston and we have a room where 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.350
 he keeps all his little things you have to 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.840
 understand that all is 8 with 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.610
 creative therefore logically so what 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.350
 could in fact have been able to do it 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.209
 more big but good here we have 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.010
 a kitchen I like the kitchen because it was 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.630
 put is that on top that are carpets 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.590
 and I just put you version plates and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.420
 with rugs there is also quite 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.300
 cool here you see that they are blocks of 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.560
 lapis lazuli and well is pretty cool 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.120
 that has a refrigerator that you inherit and you see 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.380
 that you get food because here inside 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.940
 It has a lot on it then you 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.950
 you can go and give you on the railing 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.170
 and of less grace since a chest where 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.180
 I imagine that I would put food in the case 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350
 that he played in surval is wrong for the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.480
 inscription you want to declare it 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.880
 as always we have a TV a 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 television with its speakers and their 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.840
 shelving or mobile bookstores and sea 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.330
 and here with a table made with pistons 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.960
 that go up and decorated with a 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.490
 quartz sofa as not and with this and 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.440
 now half says what bread here there are things 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.760
 that we do not understand why I'm here 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.100
 which makes us pay more lights imagine 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.170
 that you want to watch TV without problems 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.270
 let's put the lights on and in case 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.190
 then with this if you give you go 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.840
 down would make it down 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.200
 we go until what it does close 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.200
 I mean 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.890
 guarantees and closes here is worth nothing is a 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.780
 pot this what it does is close here and 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.850
 this what he does here then that is to open 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.810
 the good does the same if you look 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.690
 they are equally communicated and well then that 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.980
 what today I think rotor mechanism because 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.690
 left here open there should not be 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.100
 touched is therefore worth the law to why not 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.050
 make guys this you should not do it 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.260
 Well if it does not happen what happens then it's worth 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.750
 when it's like that 6 so it does not 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.970
 you do not see this you break everything 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.560
 the channel and that's fine then I'm going 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.150
 well he just fuck the guy the map 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.800
 but good anyway is what we have a 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.900
 a lever that makes closing the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.140
 classrooms and here we see some classrooms that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.630
 we can be here relaxing and here 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.130
 you see there's a lot of coal that says 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.500
 that we can throw it down to flip it 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.110
 for about the temperature flip it over and 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.000
 so the temperature goes up as he is 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.890
 a nonsense must understand but good 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.360
 total nonsense we can also 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.440
 close from here with the lever 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.240
 but do not worry because we can 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.920
 leave if we give it back is a 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.510
 foolishness is a silly but good basement 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.600
 you can see that he is cool if we go up 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.700
 above 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.350
 above all we have things also very 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.420
 cool because we ended up here and I 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.370
 love how is this super handsome this 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.440
 has his eye to ender here with these 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.420
 little things here has its place to 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.680
 enchant dry to your potions site 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.360
 that only has two but hey is very 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.040
 well then as you can see how he put it 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.310
 a creative because he could put here what 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.530
 that he wanted from the portal to the end and the 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.270
 portal to never after here we have 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.190
 another corridor this corridor if we go down 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.360
 here here he would take us to the stable 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.740
 what you have seen before here is where 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.940
 we have the animals and all that we are going to 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.220
 go to show you what and so that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.740
 you say is not we teach it or not if not 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.180
 you have all the animals here 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.790
 not all have not lost how many 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.090
 would be missing that would treat here wolves 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.970
 kittens good things of those we do not follow 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.470
 then around here if we go down 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.330
 now here and we go directly work 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.040
 we find an area to 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.210
 relax with a pool if you fix 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.190
 everything is covered, something that I do not 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.440
 convinces all 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.360
 have to sunbathing but I do not know I do not 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.830
 It is very convincing to cover it like this but 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.330
 I also understand it because he wants 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.400
 have everything covered but it does not just 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.990
 convince that we will see a jacuzzi for 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.370
 relax you see that it has no glass 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.630
 down but simply put 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.340
 this and so it disguises and remains 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.919
 cool because it looks like a gravel jacuzzi 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.199
 finally if we go up to method and 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.310
 we go on the contrary everything straight we 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.350
 we help with the different crops 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.600
 here you see you do not have all the hic 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.580
 The mind is already missing a lot 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.560
 would be the ones of good not so many 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.720
 of pumpkin and those of melon or watermelon 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.150
 Well, these little things you can not see 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.260
 or the cactus ones I think the house I'm going 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.820
 to give my opinion as I always do with 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.949
 You will have to download these houses 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.360
 logically I think it's very good or 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.220
 I think it takes a job so much is done 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.710
 it is messed up because the work 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.940
 it would be infinitely more but logically 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.860
 has a very big job what 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.479
 do it in creative forgive me for 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.700
 forgive me for doing this because the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.440
 shit or not or I had not tried it 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.389
 explained that the button should not because 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.070
 it would not be as normal as if you're 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.419
 below everything they will say to the button 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.910
 up first that case and this serves 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.040
 to approve the total hall lights 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.200
 guys is an automatic house without 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.669
 But I see it is not much for 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.620
 live or you would have to adapt it a 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.919
 little bit in the sense that I think that 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.270
 there would be no chests or crops, I do not know 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.639
 I think a good house but to live 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.860
 for me things would be missing however I think 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.940
 which is very beautiful I love it and see you 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.260
 You can also leave your 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.880
 I like these favorites you can

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.069

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.229
 I have a lot
