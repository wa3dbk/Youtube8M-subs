and novices and what we found is that

but<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> most<00:01:27.900> interesting<00:01:28.380> part<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
but the most interesting part was that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.300 
but the most interesting part was that
the<00:01:29.689> novices<00:01:30.689> exhibited<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.530> lot<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.950> stress

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the novices exhibited a lot of stress

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
the novices exhibited a lot of stress
and<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:33.150> only<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.900> became

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and not only that but as they became

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170 
and not only that but as they became
stressed<00:01:34.650> they<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:35.159> went<00:01:35.700> faster<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
stressed they actually went faster and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.969 
stressed they actually went faster and
faster<00:01:36.329> than<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.930> really<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.590> a
