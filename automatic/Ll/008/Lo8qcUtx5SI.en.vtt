00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
happening to be conscious of the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.880

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
phenomenon the experience it also allows

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.430 
phenomenon the experience it also allows
them<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.550> communicate<00:02:13.120> more<00:02:13.750> clearly<00:02:13.810> and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.089 

it's<00:02:26.370> important<00:02:26.879> for<00:02:26.999> me<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.409> students

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
it's important for me that the students

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.420 
it's important for me that the students
are<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.549> dancers<00:02:29.969> developed<00:02:30.510> an<00:02:30.749> Italian

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
problem-solving to me it's not to teach

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.679 
problem-solving to me it's not to teach
single<00:02:34.530> lips<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.969> teach<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.299> method

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
single lips but if you teach a method

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.809 
single lips but if you teach a method
that<00:02:36.870> allows<00:02:37.139> them<00:02:37.439> to<00:02:37.469> do<00:02:37.829> all<00:02:38.219> this

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
that allows them to do all this

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.740 
that allows them to do all this

to<00:02:42.750> my<00:02:42.900> experience<00:02:43.469> as<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> dancer<00:02:44.219> and<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.489> a

to my experience as a dancer and as a
teacher<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.120> came<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.109> conclusion<00:02:46.290> that

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
teacher I came to the conclusion that

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.949 
teacher I came to the conclusion that
most<00:02:47.099> cliffs<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.639> become<00:02:47.969> relatively<00:02:48.750> easy

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
most cliffs can become relatively easy

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.039 
most cliffs can become relatively easy
to<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:50.430> really<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.909> question<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.599> strength

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
to do it's really a question of strength

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.890 
to do it's really a question of strength
or<00:02:52.290> weight<00:02:52.769> it's<00:02:53.549> almost<00:02:54.150> always<00:02:54.419> a<00:02:54.629> question

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
or weight it's almost always a question

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.539 
or weight it's almost always a question
of<00:02:55.200> technique<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:58.260> me<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.469> most<00:02:58.829> exciting

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
of technique to me the most exciting

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.129 
of technique to me the most exciting
moment<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.060> my<00:03:00.269> teaching<00:03:00.689> is<00:03:00.810> when<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
moment of my teaching is when the

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.619 
moment of my teaching is when the
student<00:03:01.560> exclaimed<00:03:02.040> oh<00:03:02.250> my<00:03:02.879> god<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:03.419> easy

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
student exclaimed oh my god it's so easy
