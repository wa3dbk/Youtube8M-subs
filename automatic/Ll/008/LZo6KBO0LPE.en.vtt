00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929

 they'm like me and I just 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.160
 right i want the a little tutorial 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.690
 do something I already last 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.240
 ringer let's play or stream on 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.130
 Have you seen this is about the in 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.890
 quotes double job like me 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 call 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.660
 you see here is morde kaiser 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.199
 not the thing bit too loud I am 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.420
 I'm not sure 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.859
 Her Majesty's Emperor is a bit too far away for her 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.599
 I want to jump at him but I want to 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.550
 like to take care of him with my and commitment 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.289
 if I am now my uni in the bushes am 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 would do tomorrow would emperor 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680
 brecht is an exclamation and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.000
 would cover up like that 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.430
 in normal cases makes this trick dogging 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.780
 range mpc but here it is very simple 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.370
 how then you can do it and jan 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 jump to 1 million goes into it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.710
 snack and can directly on the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.260
 jump on opponents thus have as 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 said a quasi double jump is yet to come 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.469
 he should still have other opponents 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.879
 For example, here are yes up here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.530
 a million on the world and at the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.109
 process and then jumps him here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.760
 or if he is here that's cool 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.320
 because that gives the opponent less 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.420
 reaction time and also gives this 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 effect of it is easy at the beginning 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 no one can do this trick either 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.030
 otherwise use yes you have that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.170
 has also seen more often 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.640
 I can not do that right now 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.409
 because of the music and easy 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 way too high and you know that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.520
 Can not edit videos 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 I do not care about any of that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.939
 and energy goes screaming jumps 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.340
 So do you like champions against the likes 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.360
 squeeze you in csi's face or 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 something like jacques with the propeller 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.710
 result, scream, jump, jump 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.360
 adversary makes euro and ii 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.049
 Skin your whole comfort that gets 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.030
 immediately cc alleged by your opponent 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.579
 stand 6 turns on the propellers and leaves 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.689
 in this process immediately the west then 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.399
 shield, however, shortly investruine 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.470
 Maybe you already have cc off 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.310
 get and go in the course of the ccs 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:58.079
 Invisible or or or combo on it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.460
 the opponent did not do anything and 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.530
 the choice on your grace and gives 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.740
 so you can eat and so you can 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.009
 take advantage of it so in a small 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.840
 to do tricks 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.259
