00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:22.420
 putre 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 as every night was the military patrol 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.210
 formed by eight members of the Chilean army forces 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.260
 being in charge of these to the end valdés garrido

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.010
 good simple 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.190
 watch the valdés stables and five of his men sang and laughed 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.830
 around a campfire to fight as usual in the foothills 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.790
 Andean 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.580
 the intense cold of up to 15 degrees below zero someone looked at the clock 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.420
 it was 3 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.010
 45 when 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.780
 suddenly 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.610
 they came running pedro rosales and juan reyes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.130
 they were making the guard shouting very nervous and scared 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.760
 come 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.980
 come and see what happens on the hill 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.630
 there is a giant light 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.020
 alerted by their companions verify that this light is effectively going down 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740
 down the hill and they are getting closer and closer 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.110
 they manage to see not one 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.430
 but two lights 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.620
 immediately 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.090
 the corporal putting up the valdés 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.290
 commanding the group 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 ordered to put out the campfire the lights were very powerful becoming blinding what 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.510
 they illuminated everything on that moonless night 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.760
 getting even physiologically influence the dog of the 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.810
 patrol and the horses that stood still as statues 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.130
 movements of the lights are described as spectacular 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.789
 coming to distinguish that one of them is oval and with small 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.780
 red lights inside 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.790
 more and more is getting closer to the patrol 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.390
 the panic begins to take hold of the young soldiers before the proximity of the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.260
 Valdés object orders his men to stand with their arms clasped 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.120
 thus making a human chain if something happens 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.050
 let's all go together 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.140
 told them 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.510
 the patrol begins to pray balance but without moving a whit 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.469
 paralyzed 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.280
 this is when you are valdés assuming the role of leader and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.479
 charging of value 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.429
 approaching the light ahead of about 15 meters asking them to identify 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.049
 not hearing the answer 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.260
 the corporal continued walking a little more and exclaimed in the name of God who are 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.920
 your 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.220
 a kind of strange my evh the silhouette of the non-commissioner 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.360
 making him disappear from the sight of his own men 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.649
 suddenly all the military components of this patrol were given 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.350
 like coming out of a strange dream and feeling drowsy 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.139
 even so 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.409
 his first action as a group was to look for the corporal valdés 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.199
 they were organized into two teams and started the search 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.849
 it was frantic but without getting any results 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.639
 they did not find their trace 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.480
 but the UFO remained motionless in the same place 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.189
 after fifteen minutes 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.839
 they felt like falling a bundle on the other side or maybe it came from above was him 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.489
 In an inexplicable way, the military reappears out of nowhere 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.010
 he was in a trance using a rare intonation he was floating 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.010
 unconnected coming you will only understand boys 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:11.089
 at that same moment the soldiers collapsed in an unconscious state 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.060
 They picked him up and took him to the remains of the campfire 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.319
 to try to revive him even with strong blows 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.949
 in the end valdés comes back and pronounces an enigmatic phrase that still 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.790
 today it is still engraved in the minds of his men 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.769
 you do not know who we are 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.999
 nor where do we come from 

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:29.369
 but we will return 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:32.629
 throughout the night the corporal remains in shock 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.969
 Laughing nonsensically remembering his mother saying endless phrases of 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.310
 difficult to understand 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.780
 the recruits also realize that the military man had the grown beard was 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.080
 totally inexplicable since he was freshly shaved that same night and 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.560
 his watch was five days ahead the latter was not correct as well as 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.540
 they comment infinity of chronicles 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.409
 it was not really ahead of time, it was the other way around 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.969
 He was late and he was marking the 20th and it was not even his watch but one of 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.819
 his companions and they did not come to realize this event until the day 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.819
 following 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.229
 this is the story of one of the abductions that most spread 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.589
 research they have had since it is considered among the most 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.449
 impressive not only of chile 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.049
 but also from the rest of the planet due to the quality of those involved 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.940
 the strangeness of the event and because it has proof of it 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.070
 is such the importance of the case that it was even investigated by the center or 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.990
 National biological survey of Rome, as the most important example of 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.380
 temporal distortion in the history of extraterrestrial phenomena during 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.570
 years the corporal valdés was persecuted by journalists from all over the world to speak 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.840
 of what he had experienced that early morning of April 25, 1977 and with figures 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.029
 very high economic to tell what happened but he was silent 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.520
 the Chilean army prohibited him from giving any kind of declaration to the 

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.859
 respect reaching even into the hands of the company that tried to hide and control 

00:04:55.859 --> 00:04:57.150
 events 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.449
 it was much later when Arming valdez garrido decided to tell his abduction to 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.420
 different means of communication providing new information and experiences 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.169
 later that according to him 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.389
 had continued to have point the Spanish writer Antonio Rivera is 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.479
 convinced that the corporal valdés was removed from our normal space and 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.650
 Ford to another space and another time 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.230
 the strangest thing of all is that he may be right 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.310
 dogi by the end of the story I hope that you have already liked the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.790
 skeptics who value this information thank you and greetings to all
