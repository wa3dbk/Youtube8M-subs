00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
deals and then they also had I guess the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.510

turkey shoot it what what it was called

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700

so maybe they'll do thing for Christmas
not<00:01:50.100> sure<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.110> be

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
not sure but if they do that would be

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.899 
not sure but if they do that would be
