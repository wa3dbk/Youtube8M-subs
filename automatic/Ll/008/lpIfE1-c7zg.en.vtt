00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:10.650
 and it really is a decision 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.370
 that we speak despite some 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.230
 disadvantages let's go let's 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.619
 on the margin those things because in the end 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.800
 we know that to take a 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.529
 decision of this type we have 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.240
 and be totally convinced that 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.029
 this 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.550
 is a very serious thing and that is for all 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.190
 life I always say in experience 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.950
 I have when we take the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.130
 decisions were married or form of 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.380
 a family 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.910
 we should always think that he has to 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.579
 be for life 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.160
 and that must be so because in reality the 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.270
 marriage 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.690
 it's a nice life experience of two 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.650
 beings that know each other and decide 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.010
 join when they really know what will be 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.120
 so I really 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 I accompany unstable miguel because 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.900
 we always talk with your decisions and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.110
 I can not leave it either, just because 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.140
 I have seen it grow and in that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.610
 formality we want to ask for more 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.610
 that nothing hand 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.340
 to formalize this union with 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.380
 You already know 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 the type of person the kind of person 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.670
 which is definitely we will be 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.310
 accompanying them always so that they 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.440
 consolidate in this relationship and in that 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.300
 true formality 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.580
 We come to request and orders is this 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.010
 the hand as it is formally said for 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.770
 that they can have that stage of 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.810
 pedestrian courtship in its decision to 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.400
 marriage within a reasonable time as 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.400
 that independent spirit 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.940
 good night good to all 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.800
 present 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:14.540
 as you today father says it is something 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.540
 formal and we are all 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.520
 well in this case we already know the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.900
 Miguel Barroso too and we know 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.460
 perfectly that he is a boy 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.310
 studious worker with the child and about 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.860
 everything that I see some great qualities in 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.410
 he especially a future also when 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.140
 become a father and form a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.000
 family so with my wife and I have 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.720
 thought nice and we have seen then in 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.470
 these two years that if really 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 have the qualities of becoming a 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.270
 good father a good husband for those 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.770
 moments we have decided to accept this 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.770
 relationship because 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.030
 commitment 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 so you can this 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.540
 put there
