00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.610

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.310

 more pacitel chat with you in 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.229
 outside the youtube channel 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.659
 so I'm concerned myself first of all 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.000
 reassure you I'm much better I 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.439
 went through a difficult phase 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.390
 emotionally 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.890
 now I have not got into the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 details I 'll just explain this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.269
 happened like that you know 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.580
 for me we do not stir the past that 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.200
 is useless it just serves to 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.200
 lesson to grow as a person 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.810
 and I hope it will have taught me better 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.099
 protect myself to summarize when I write 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.269
 this chain there are a little more than two 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.640
 years I really happened to you at one point 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.890
 of my life where I wanted to share 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.690
 my knowledge because myself 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.849
 since very young I suffer from 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.290
 problems of overweight and also of 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.510
 behavioral disorders compared to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.329
 nutrition so use nutrition 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.220
 really as comfort also 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.170
 when we are happy it was really 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.510
 for me something 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.819
 he turned me what day to all 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.109
 possible reasons and on the last 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.260
 years I have not only managed to 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:51.109
 lose weight including 23 kg but manage 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.760
 I also managed to change my attitude 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.500
 in relation to nutrition how do I 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 manages how I see her and I thought 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.650
 that you are really something that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.819
 could help for over 8 years I 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.100
 luck as a nutrition coach 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.420
 to help my clients to balance their 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.980
 diet but still plays there go 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.260
 further because I realized 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.389
 counts that 2 by the media we have 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.950
 a lot of false information is 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.600
 also a lot of misconceptions that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.040
 have consented little lost that we do not know 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.810
 plus what to do so I thought 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.670
 that youtube will be the ideal platform 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.680
 to share touch the biggest 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.280
 number of people have to say that I 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.990
 am someone who likes to help 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.610
 I have always been like that since 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.420
 young and so I really did with 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.580
 great pleasure 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.170
 but I was not realized as an exposÃ© 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.310
 so jal also came across on 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.860
 people who are a little less well 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.170
 intentional and I grant you 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.850
 they are rare among the number of 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.400
 positive feedback I have on the channel 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.510
 it is clear but being very sensitive in 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.060
 as a person myself 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.590
 it is true that it leaves me easily 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.390
 So that's why I told you 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.459
 I hope his death served as a lesson for 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.650
 more but it's like that touched but 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.360
 good I remain human then I also 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.800
 felt a big fatigue because 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.269
 for a year I really gave myself 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 a lot in my chain that was all 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.300
 new to me so I first have you to 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.620
 take and then I did a lot of 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.709
 videos like I have you I think there's 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.800
 has more than 150 already and ben is the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.170
 time to film them to avoid them from 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.280
 reply to a message here on facebook 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.650
 by private message 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.330
 it represents a lot of hours in 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.800
 a week even comes to me that I was going 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.500
 to sleep more and more late to 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.079
 answer as many posts which 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.669
 did not make me very happy 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.889
 companion and I do not understand what 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.620
 I would not have liked him to make him a friend 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.030
 me what made me 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.010
 nights shorter and shorter 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.090
 which is really not healthy and hence a 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.740
 tiredness 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.690
 so despite the fact that I really love 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.640
 share with you my tips because 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.400
 I really feel like I'm used to 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.350
 something not to be on this 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.320
 world just to live but really from 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.360
 to take part in these two factors have 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.830
 did I have to learn to say that I 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.010
 decided to take a step back to take 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.710
 care of me I could not have you 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.720
 share my good mood 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.890
 my motivation while I myself 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.250
 was not good at taking care of 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.820
 other 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.110
 First take care of yourself and that's me 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.640
 I wanted to be sincere with you I 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.380
 did not want to pretend in front of the camera 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.030
 when that was wrong I was looking forward to it 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.770
 to resume at the same time I have 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.110
 learn how to better manage my time 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.570
 that's my resolution of the year the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.710
 pregnancy earlier in the year 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.930
 because here I have to get to 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.750
 ja link between my job coach my 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.980
 family life monfils who does not ask 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.770
 attention poorly from his mom what is 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.900
 quite normal my blog my sport the 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.340
 chain that's all there is that there 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.280
 a lot of things to handle so I have to 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.390
 just find a happy medium 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.520
 besides I do not know if you know 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.350
 but just prepare the subject of a 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.820
 video the spinning skid a lot 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.620
 of hours but I did you elsewhere 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.970
 an article that actually break down the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.200
 different steps so if that you 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.670
 Interested I will return the link 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.050
 below I decided to resume 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.730
 videos but at a slower pace 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.950
 supported i will first treat the 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.050
 topics that in my opinion could the most 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.220
 to ideas immediately there would be 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.780
 also new recipes I 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.180
 really you already full full full 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.890
 of visa ideas you turn so 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.080
 I hope it will help you especially 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.670
 It will please me 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.140
 Besides, I have already treated a lot of 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.420
 subjects whose big topics like 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.640
 the importance of water breakfast 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.990
 in case and so on now I know 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.000
 that there is a lot of information so 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.350
 also you actually go to my blog there 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.930
 is a search engine down to 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.070
 right and just type the word of 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.240
 what are you looking for so if by 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.550
 example you want to have tips 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.870
 to drink more water will you type in 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.460
 exhaling see all video articles where 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.840
 I mentioned the word I actually 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.280
 this job and I do not know if you have it 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.700
 saw there is a new version of the blog in 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.890
 line 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.810
 we reworked it to take your 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.630
 more pleasant experience on the site 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.940
 clearer and so it's at the level of 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.650
 design but also at the level of 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.020
 menus so if you go see there is a 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.630
 menu called videos and articles 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.610
 and there you can by mail actually 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.370
 information by different themes 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.400
 so nutrition the sport etc and in 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.440
 clicking on the recipe tab there 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.479
 you can even by clicking on see 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.160
 the photos browse them this photo format 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.410
 because I know that sometimes just read 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.940
 the title the recipe does not give more 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.430
 want that we do not see any relatives 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.960
 say so I added this function
