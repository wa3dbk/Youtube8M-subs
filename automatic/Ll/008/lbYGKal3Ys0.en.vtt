for everything I suppose bargain Expos
probably<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.540> chuck<00:03:46.780> in<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:46.960> charcoal<00:03:47.410> and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
probably be chuck in the charcoal and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.000 
probably be chuck in the charcoal and
getting<00:03:48.280> something<00:03:48.670> completely<00:03:49.480> different

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
getting something completely different

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.770 
getting something completely different
there<00:03:51.010> are<00:03:51.040> different<00:03:51.750> levels<00:03:52.770> from<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.830> flow

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
there are different levels from the flow

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.890 
there are different levels from the flow
when<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.870> put<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.260> lid<00:03:56.530> back<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:59.430> here<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.550> I

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
when you put the lid back on here it I

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.540 
when you put the lid back on here it I
don't<00:04:01.900> know<00:04:01.960> if<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.170> can<00:04:02.320> see<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.650> but<00:04:03.340> there's

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
don't know if you can see it but there's

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.660 
don't know if you can see it but there's
a<00:04:03.640> slide<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.350> adjusts<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.980> amount<00:04:06.100> of<00:04:06.340> flow

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
a slide that adjusts the amount of flow

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.720 
a slide that adjusts the amount of flow
coming<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.050> out<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.590> filter<00:04:09.010> some<00:04:09.700> of

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
coming in and out of the filter some of

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.090 
coming in and out of the filter some of
the<00:04:09.880> flow<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.210> adjusted<00:04:10.690> Hill<00:04:10.920> trickles<00:04:11.920> right

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
the flow is adjusted Hill trickles right

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.670 
the flow is adjusted Hill trickles right
out<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.370> front<00:04:12.810> I'm<00:04:13.810> gonna<00:04:13.960> go<00:04:14.170> hook<00:04:14.350> it<00:04:14.530> up

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
out to the front I'm gonna go hook it up

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.359 
out to the front I'm gonna go hook it up
and<00:04:14.890> we're<00:04:15.250> gonna<00:04:15.340> see<00:04:15.640> how<00:04:15.820> well<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.120> works
