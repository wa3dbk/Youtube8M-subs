00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
so we plays it live it has a whole bunch

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:22.820 
so we plays it live it has a whole bunch
of<00:05:11.670> different<00:05:11.790> stuff<00:05:19.970> so<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:22.320> can<00:05:22.350> listen<00:05:22.710> to

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
of different stuff so you can listen to

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.730 
of different stuff so you can listen to
that<00:05:22.860> when<00:05:23.160> you<00:05:23.220> get<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.370> chance<00:05:23.640> and<00:05:24.740> one

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
that when you get a chance and one

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.340 
that when you get a chance and one
little<00:05:25.980> change<00:05:26.250> them<00:05:26.460> in<00:05:26.550> little<00:05:26.670> but<00:05:27.090> I<00:05:27.480> don't

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
little change them in little but I don't

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.560 
little change them in little but I don't
know<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.440> guess<00:05:28.680> it's<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.950> bridge<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:30.360> hitting

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
know I guess it's a bridge just hitting

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:40.160 
know I guess it's a bridge just hitting
the<00:05:30.630> back<00:05:30.810> going<00:05:31.050> back<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.410> C<00:05:38.870> first<00:05:39.870> fret

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
the back going back to the C first fret
