morning<00:01:55.229> even<00:01:55.799> further<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> north<00:01:57.259> so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
morning even further to the north so

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
morning even further to the north so
when<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.100> got<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> Reds<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
when it got with the Reds and the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.969 
when it got with the Reds and the
Purple's<00:02:00.960> they're<00:02:01.110> showing<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.740> it's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
Purple's they're showing that it's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.980 
Purple's they're showing that it's
pretty<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:03.119> confident<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.719> we're<00:02:03.899> going

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
pretty pretty confident that we're going

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.870 
pretty pretty confident that we're going
to<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.200> over<00:02:04.560> four<00:02:04.770> inches<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.040> snow<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
to get over four inches of snow in that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.839 
to get over four inches of snow in that
band<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> trends

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
band but as you can see the trends

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.580 
band but as you can see the trends
continue<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.300> keep<00:02:09.450> taking<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.899> northward<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
continue to keep taking it northward and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
continue to keep taking it northward and
it's<00:02:10.890> possible<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.970> could<00:02:12.120> keep<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.480> going

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
it's possible that could keep on going

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's possible that could keep on going
that<00:02:12.930> way

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that way

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.490 
that way
so<00:02:14.340> here's<00:02:14.580> our<00:02:14.760> latest<00:02:15.140> forecast<00:02:16.140> amounts

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so here's our latest forecast amounts

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.759 
so here's our latest forecast amounts
from<00:02:17.489> our<00:02:17.670> office<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.510> left<00:02:18.989> hand<00:02:19.200> image<00:02:19.500> is

from<00:02:22.950> tonight<00:02:23.879> through<00:02:24.510> Tuesday<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:25.830> there's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
from tonight through Tuesday so there's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
from tonight through Tuesday so there's
some<00:02:26.550> pretty<00:02:26.640> high<00:02:26.879> amounts<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.750> we're

some pretty high amounts here that we're

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.949 
some pretty high amounts here that we're

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
jackson counties but this area also

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.770 
jackson counties but this area also
didn't<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.670> whole<00:02:38.819> lot<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:39.060> snow<00:02:39.299> forecast

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.420 
didn't have a whole lot of snow forecast
over<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> past<00:02:40.319> few<00:02:40.500> days<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.099> band

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
over the past few days as this band

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.490 
over the past few days as this band
continues<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.940> shift<00:02:42.000> north<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.870> we'll<00:02:43.410> have

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
continues to shift north so we'll have

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.430 
continues to shift north so we'll have
to<00:02:43.709> continue<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.190> monitor<00:02:44.720> how<00:02:45.720> those<00:02:45.989> trends

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
to continue to monitor how those trends

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.289 
to continue to monitor how those trends
look<00:02:46.680> over<00:02:47.010> today<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.519> net<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.819> tomorrow

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
look over today in the net and tomorrow

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.410 
look over today in the net and tomorrow
as<00:02:48.569> well<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:49.560> much<00:02:49.769> ice<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.579> just

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
as well not much ice with this just

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.930 
as well not much ice with this just
mainly<00:02:51.660> some<00:02:51.989> sleep<00:02:52.290> possible<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.700> this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
mainly some sleep possible in this

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.500 
mainly some sleep possible in this
transition<00:02:54.390> area<00:02:54.840> where<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.170> heavier<00:02:55.410> snow

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
transition area where the heavier snow

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.569 
transition area where the heavier snow
transitions<00:02:57.510> down<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> cell<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.430> main

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
transitions down to the cell so the main

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.490 
transitions down to the cell so the main
impacts<00:03:00.000> there's<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.019> heavy<00:03:01.200> snow

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
north at least in our forecast models so

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.960 
north at least in our forecast models so
we're<00:03:07.590> pretty<00:03:08.129> confident<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.700> there's

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
we're pretty confident that there's

we're pretty confident that there's
gonna<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.150> heavy<00:03:09.299> snow<00:03:09.629> that's<00:03:09.870> going<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.079> fall

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
gonna be heavy snow that's going to fall

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.690 
gonna be heavy snow that's going to fall
it's<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.769> matter<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.069> where<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.549> going

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
it's just a matter of where it's going

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.600 
it's just a matter of where it's going
to<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.900> bulk<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.890> precipitation<00:03:14.010> is

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
to be the bulk of the precipitation is

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.850 
to be the bulk of the precipitation is
going<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.790> start<00:03:15.150> Monday<00:03:15.690> morning<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.470> last

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
going to start Monday morning and last

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.530 
going to start Monday morning and last
through<00:03:17.190> much<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> day<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.269> Monday

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
through much of the day so the Monday

morning in Monday afternoon commute is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.660 
morning in Monday afternoon commute is
going<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.650> probably<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:23.010> deal<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.430> some

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
going to probably have to deal with some

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.120 
going to probably have to deal with some
snow<00:03:23.910> covered<00:03:24.239> roads<00:03:24.480> there<00:03:25.130> particularly

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
snow covered roads there particularly

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.520 
snow covered roads there particularly
further<00:03:26.489> north<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:27.060> that's<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.510> way<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
further north if that's the way the the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.949 
further north if that's the way the the
trend<00:03:28.859> sent<00:03:29.069> ends<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.489> going<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:30.030> then<00:03:30.720> for

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
trend sent ends up going and then for

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.180 
trend sent ends up going and then for
those<00:03:31.139> cells<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.530> little<00:03:31.709> bit<00:03:31.799> more<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.099> a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
those cells a little bit more of a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.640 
those cells a little bit more of a
leader<00:03:32.700> or<00:03:33.030> rain<00:03:33.450> where<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> warmer<00:03:34.440> air<00:03:34.470> is

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
leader or rain where the warmer air is

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.370 
leader or rain where the warmer air is
going<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.829> be<00:03:34.920> mixing<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.420> those<00:03:36.900> impacts

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
going to be mixing in so those impacts

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.319 
going to be mixing in so those impacts
to<00:03:37.530> travel<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.489> roadways<00:03:38.849> could<00:03:39.060> be<00:03:39.180> pretty

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
to travel the roadways could be pretty

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.050 
to travel the roadways could be pretty
slick<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.609> that's<00:03:41.609> your<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:41.849> weather
