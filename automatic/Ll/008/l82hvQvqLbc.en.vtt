00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
for crushed nests I just first of all I

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.169 
for crushed nests I just first of all I
did<00:00:28.270> a<00:00:28.300> quick<00:00:29.109> google<00:00:29.140> search<00:00:29.500> on<00:00:30.099> on<00:00:30.760> the

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
did a quick google search on on the

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.610 
did a quick google search on on the
bird's<00:00:31.390> nest<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.570> look<00:00:34.720> at<00:00:34.870> where<00:00:35.470> the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
bird's nest just to look at where the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.420 
bird's nest just to look at where the
supply<00:00:36.040> is<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.930> looks<00:00:38.110> like<00:00:38.320> you<00:00:39.010> can<00:00:39.160> only

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.880 

get<00:00:42.430> bird's<00:00:43.210> nest<00:00:43.540> from<00:00:43.720> cutting<00:00:44.110> trees<00:00:44.379> and

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
get bird's nest from cutting trees and

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.410 
get bird's nest from cutting trees and
there's<00:00:45.280> a<00:00:45.370> place<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:48.000> miscellanea<00:00:49.000> where<00:00:49.300> you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
there's a place in miscellanea where you

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.889 
there's a place in miscellanea where you
can<00:00:49.629> get<00:00:49.899> a<00:00:49.960> few<00:00:50.260> nests<00:00:50.710> a<00:00:50.860> day<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.360> it<00:00:52.840> looks

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
can get a few nests a day so it looks

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.470 
can get a few nests a day so it looks
like<00:00:53.199> this<00:00:53.500> there's<00:00:53.949> not<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.280> lot<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:55.559> supply

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
like this there's not a lot of supply

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.650 
like this there's not a lot of supply
they're<00:00:58.480> not<00:00:58.660> stackable<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.910> it's<00:01:01.329> not<00:01:01.449> like

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
they're not stackable so it's not like

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.729 
they're not stackable so it's not like
there's<00:01:01.899> going<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.140> be<00:01:02.199> a<00:01:02.289> whole<00:01:02.469> stack<00:01:02.710> of

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
there's going to be a whole stack of

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.700 
there's going to be a whole stack of
supply<00:01:03.219> come<00:01:03.489> in<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:04.030> that's<00:01:04.960> looking<00:01:05.680> pretty

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
supply come in so that's looking pretty

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.350 
supply come in so that's looking pretty
good<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:08.039> that<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.280> graph<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.789> there's<00:01:10.270> a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
good right that the graph is there's a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.660 
good right that the graph is there's a
technical<00:01:10.720> buy<00:01:10.899> signal<00:01:11.320> there<00:01:11.500> now<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.130> it's

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
technical buy signal there now so it's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.930 
technical buy signal there now so it's
not<00:01:12.940> really<00:01:13.800> it's<00:01:14.800> not<00:01:14.920> really<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.369> spec<00:01:15.700> trade

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
not really it's not really a spec trade

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.590 
not really it's not really a spec trade
anymore<00:01:16.240> but<00:01:16.720> anyway<00:01:17.110> here<00:01:18.040> we<00:01:18.070> go<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:18.729> let<00:01:19.720> me

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.030 

okay<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.660> I'm<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.590> quick<00:01:25.770> check

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
okay so I'm just going to a quick check

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.010 
okay so I'm just going to a quick check
on<00:01:26.280> spectra<00:01:27.090> later<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.660> if<00:01:27.690> anyone<00:01:28.140> some

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
on spectra later to see if anyone some

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
on spectra later to see if anyone some
cool<00:01:36.710> all<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.890> I've<00:01:38.010> checked<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> graphs

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
cool all right I've checked the graphs

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.660 
cool all right I've checked the graphs
so<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.150> crush<00:01:42.150> Ness<00:01:42.450> oh<00:01:46.670> I've

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.580 
thousand of them at max okay so as 22 mm
okay<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.140> I'll<00:02:04.140> put<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.470> that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
okay so there we go I'll put in that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.010 
okay so there we go I'll put in that
order<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.700> let's<00:02:06.320> see<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:07.979> many<00:02:08.190> i<00:02:08.280> get

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
order and let's see how many i get

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:18.620 
order and let's see how many i get
I<00:02:10.110> got<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.410> all<00:02:12.800> hmm<00:02:15.500> okay<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:18.150> seems<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
I got them all hmm okay so this seems to

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.170 
I got them all hmm okay so this seems to
be<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.780> fair<00:02:19.110> amount<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.440> supply<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.180> I've

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
be a fair amount of supply there I've

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.500 
be a fair amount of supply there I've
I've<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.900> picked<00:02:22.080> up<00:02:23.540> 10,000<00:02:24.540> or<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:26.510> that's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
I've just picked up 10,000 or so that's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
I've just picked up 10,000 or so that's
not<00:02:28.049> really<00:02:28.320> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.709> push<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.040> price<00:02:29.220> much

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
not really going to push the price much

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.680 
not really going to push the price much
but<00:02:30.380> anyway<00:02:31.380> I'll<00:02:31.560> probably<00:02:31.769> fill<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.220> order

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
but anyway I'll probably fill that order

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.430 
but anyway I'll probably fill that order
as<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.019> can<00:02:34.140> see<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:35.330> yeah<00:02:36.330> i<00:02:36.780> mean<00:02:37.110> i<00:02:37.200> bought
