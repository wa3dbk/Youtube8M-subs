00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.020
 to place on the country in the route 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.769
 Vehicle 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.950
 at the rally 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.090
 we must pass pedestrians 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.679
 crossing the road 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.960
 on a pedestrian crossing 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.039
 is necessary 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.919
 possibility of a pedestrian 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:23.849
 finish the carriageway 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.499
 this direction 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.529
 hazardous situations attention to these 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.599
 arises 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.599
 when on the road insufficient review 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.690
 pedestrians costing stopped 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.640
 bus or trolley 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 finishes from pieces from behind parked 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.870
 cars 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590
 often pedestrians cross the road to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.080
 wrong place 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.740
 or red light 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.180
 high probability of occurrence 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 a similar science situation st 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.670
 run across flour or Lenin Avenue 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.350
 Moscow 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.580
 and every deputy 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.270
 even if a pedestrian 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.250
 violates the rules the driver must 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 take all measures to prevent 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.200
 arrival 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.470
 as the car is a means 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.790
 elevated 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.370
 an illustration 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.730
 and this can serve as a real 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.740
 situations 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 the driver stopped at the pedestrian 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 transition 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.730
 pedestrians 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.730
 too stopped don't look at each other

 the driver waves his hand 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.800
 the pedestrian lay back 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.030
 as a result 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.330
 at the same time 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.520
 the pedestrian suffered physically 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.520
 and the driver went to the colony settlement 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.260
 driver 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.230
 shouldn't have gone 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.270
 need to make sure 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 did the pedestrian understand you correctly
