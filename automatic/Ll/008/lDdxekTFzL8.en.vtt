the<00:05:08.250> light<00:05:08.400> fixture<00:05:08.790> which<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.060> kind<00:05:09.270> of

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
the light fixture which is kind of

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.180 
the light fixture which is kind of
unexpected<00:05:09.930> for<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.230> indoors<00:05:10.590> but<00:05:10.920> I<00:05:10.950> think

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
unexpected for the indoors but I think

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.520 
unexpected for the indoors but I think
it<00:05:11.280> really<00:05:11.820> just<00:05:11.940> made<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.450> space<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:12.960> this

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
it really just made the space and this

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.550 
it really just made the space and this
one<00:05:13.680> was<00:05:13.800> only<00:05:14.130> 48<00:05:14.640> dollars<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:16.110> light<00:05:16.350> it's

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
one was only 48 dollars the light it's

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.700 
one was only 48 dollars the light it's
really<00:05:16.860> romantic<00:05:17.040> it's<00:05:17.760> inviting<00:05:18.420> and<00:05:18.780> it's

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
really romantic it's inviting and it's

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.290 
really romantic it's inviting and it's
not<00:05:19.830> too<00:05:20.040> formal<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.610> think<00:05:20.820> we<00:05:20.970> achieved

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
not too formal I think we achieved

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.750 
not too formal I think we achieved
something<00:05:21.360> that's<00:05:21.690> really<00:05:22.080> just<00:05:22.490> casual<00:05:23.490> but

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
something that's really just casual but

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.540 
something that's really just casual but
very<00:05:23.970> sophisticated<00:05:24.470> we<00:05:25.470> created<00:05:25.920> two<00:05:26.250> looks

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
very sophisticated we created two looks

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.130 
very sophisticated we created two looks
that<00:05:26.670> could<00:05:27.000> not<00:05:27.120> be<00:05:27.150> more<00:05:27.390> different<00:05:27.540> but<00:05:27.840> I'm

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
that could not be more different but I'm

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.590 
that could not be more different but I'm
equally<00:05:28.770> thrilled<00:05:29.100> with<00:05:29.700> both<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.180> them<00:05:30.360> one

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
equally thrilled with both of them one

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.110 
equally thrilled with both of them one
is<00:05:30.750> really<00:05:31.110> industrial<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.010> modern<00:05:32.400> has<00:05:32.730> very

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
is really industrial and modern has very

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.840 
is really industrial and modern has very
high<00:05:33.660> contrast<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.740> other<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:35.190> warm<00:05:35.610> and

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
high contrast the other is warm and

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.140 
high contrast the other is warm and
romantic<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.630> soft<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.740> quite<00:05:37.980> rustic<00:05:38.460> but

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
romantic and soft and quite rustic but

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.730 
romantic and soft and quite rustic but
they<00:05:39.240> both<00:05:39.450> display<00:05:39.840> copper<00:05:40.110> pots<00:05:40.410> and<00:05:40.680> they

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
they both display copper pots and they

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.400 
they both display copper pots and they
do<00:05:40.920> it<00:05:41.070> I<00:05:41.130> think<00:05:41.160> quite<00:05:41.580> well<00:05:41.810> copper<00:05:42.810> is<00:05:43.080> a

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
do it I think quite well copper is a

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.990 
do it I think quite well copper is a
material<00:05:43.800> that<00:05:43.890> is<00:05:43.950> incredibly<00:05:44.460> versatile

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
material that is incredibly versatile

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.420 
material that is incredibly versatile
and<00:05:45.270> because<00:05:45.750> it's<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.990> reflective<00:05:46.620> metal<00:05:46.860> also

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
and because it's a reflective metal also

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.980 
and because it's a reflective metal also
you<00:05:47.490> get<00:05:47.700> this<00:05:47.820> beautiful<00:05:48.300> brightness<00:05:48.600> and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
you get this beautiful brightness and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.450 
you get this beautiful brightness and
shine<00:05:49.260> from<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:49.890> it's<00:05:50.010> something<00:05:50.190> that's

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
shine from it so it's something that's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.390 
shine from it so it's something that's
worth<00:05:50.550> taking<00:05:51.390> out<00:05:51.510> of<00:05:51.540> the<00:05:51.720> cupboard<00:05:52.530> dusting
