00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.500
 hello everyone is made is and we 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.650
 we find the first spoiler on 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.320
 the 1.8 in this 2014 I hope you like it 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.480
 a lot and good the gold spoiler come 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.400
 bringing at the hands of jeff developer 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.169
 of minecraft and the spoiler is the one 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.869
 I'm seeing on screen and has put what 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.579
 next I'm going to rebalance the trade 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.009
 with the minecraft villagers and the 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.279
 offers will be much less random and with 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.720
 greater utility as you can see it has been 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.220
 working in the exchange with the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.570
 villagers and has decided to improve the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.100
 system in the sense that it is not so 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.080
 random everything you know there 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.510
 minecraft for example by an emerald 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.250
 they used to give you peace even things 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 quite illogical from my point of view 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.630
 of many people and what I wanted to do already 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.670
 it is a balance that makes sense 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.350
 the exchanges there are exchanges that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.750
 they are pretty good that by chicken without 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.670
 cooking td in emeralds or by paper 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 Emeralds is pretty good but 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.720
 then there are exchanges that were not 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.730
 very well compensated and clear people 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.020
 has complained and what is there today is that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.759
 work on balance these 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.229
 exchanges so that if 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.030
 you want to get emeralds do not you 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.439
 they cost not much and if you want 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.550
 get another object from 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.790
 emeralds 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.830
 that has an order and a logical sense 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.230
 logically not psychologically I 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.240
 I repeat more than I do that I know and well this one 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.830
 I would be doing the spoiler today but 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.510
 you also already know that the villagers 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.720
 they exchange are exchange for ace 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.760
 look at the many things and me from my 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.170
 point of view to me I would like the 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.910
 generated had greater use since 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.350
 they want to rebalance this exchange 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.330
 Well, since you can get emeralds 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.820
 so to speak more simply to 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.140
 from now on 1.8 then I would also fly 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.720
 that emeralds have more uses for 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.550
 example tools a Basque frame a 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.370
 Emerald arch would be the luck elite 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.410
 or for example the parents will see the one 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.060
 ax any new crash I think it 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.980
 could give the emerald and not only has 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.930
 given I think it would be a good idea already 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.610
 that rebalancing in this exchange 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.080
 Well, since then get emeralds 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.330
 as I say a little simpler 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.770
 so it makes more sense to use the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.540
 Emerald not only for him or with 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.400
 example but we have utility let's go 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.900
 I would like to see here below you will leave 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.460
 your opinion as the ideas that 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.380
 you have about the exchanges that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.450
 exchanges could you what would be 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.370
 more balanced which is more useful which less 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.720
 useful any comment is appreciated 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.620
