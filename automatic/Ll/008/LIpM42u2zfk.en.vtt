00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
see the chunks a foam that we're thrown

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.230

and<00:03:31.210> out<00:03:31.330> point<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:31.900> with<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:32.830> explosion

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
and out point so with the explosion

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.830 
and out point so with the explosion
going<00:03:33.610> in<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> front<00:03:34.150> side<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.390> didn't<00:03:34.750> have

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
going in on the front side I didn't have

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.810 
going in on the front side I didn't have
to<00:03:34.930> worry<00:03:35.080> about<00:03:35.140> debris<00:03:36.040> or<00:03:36.190> shrapnel<00:03:36.370> going

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
to worry about debris or shrapnel going

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.460 
to worry about debris or shrapnel going
out<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:37.060> way<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:37.510> pushes<00:03:37.780> out<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.290> way

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
out that way it just pushes out this way

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:53.570 
out that way it just pushes out this way
so<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:39.100> really<00:03:39.460> cool

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.580
