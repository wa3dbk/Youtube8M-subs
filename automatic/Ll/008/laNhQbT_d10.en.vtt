00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 I just tell you that it's not with guys 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.389
 from the usual powerful appears to 5 or axel 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.790
 today it is bound there are obvious solvers 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.599
 800 cup which is precisely episode 3 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.890
 then if you heard that I left 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.420
 it was not me 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.490
 I left and in a slightly different way 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 because of the boys of a group of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.609
 facebook which i will say goodbye afterwards 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.330
 precisely asked to leave in this 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.360
 so then I have done to state is no 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.670
 then in this episode I drink 800k o 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 some very important things to tell you if 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.309
 you remembered in the last one if you 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.920
 remember in the last video I had 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.780
 asked to choose the topic 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.970
 main that there would be in 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 this video or better in their asked 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.449
 if he wanted to make a profit 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.479
 powerful magician palace 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.140
 or it is a particular method for the 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.710
 Trade 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.010
 I have also chosen because many of you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 preferred the particular method 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 for me what I 'm going to tell you is the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 best way to make the sale 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 I live with now I feel from here the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.060
 your first attention because i had a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.469
 powerful tool but shovel in what 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.920
 consists 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.789
 consists in the first let's say a little 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 the rules 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.780
 john chooses a player to choose a 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 player you are very comfortable with 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.539
 to make trades maybe many of you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 they don't have it and so I just tell you 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.429
 find glow the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.979
 so once found and for example me 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.170
 these episodes I will use johnson 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.340
 now see that the stop is in fact in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.649
 the whole episode will buy come 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.359
 johnson however what you have to do when 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.159
 you have found your player 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.200
 you have to make a maximum price buy now 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.899
 and now I give you the example of johnson 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.939
 I write price but on buy in 2005 and there 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.899
 there are five objects one 2005 another 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.530
 2005 1 2 3 1 2004 and a 2005 then you 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.889
 what seeing these values ​​you will have to have 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.179
 understood you must have something in your head 

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:09.420
 you will be able to sell it at a price 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.250
 around 2,400 buy now then 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.990
 what you have to do 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.930
 you also count that there are 5 percent i 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.710
 rates and therefore you will think but gain 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.030
 of 500 for each 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.830
 johnson was pretty powerful 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.140
 so you should look for yours 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.180
 johnson at a price buy gold at a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.980
 maximum price of 1000 9th what it does 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 what you have to do next 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 you must be able to get more pieces 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.709
 possible of this player 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.360
 so I personally recommend you 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.820
 put on each offer 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.260
 obviously you will not use 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.610
 johnson because they will use it already 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.350
 many others work seen this video 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.980
 love in fact I won't use it anymore 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.720
 anyway you should maybe I recommend 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.880
 make the offer to each player who 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.790
 see on the list can you tell us maybe 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.040
 all on the first page an offer of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.170
 1,900 I'm doing it now live ok 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.900
 once you buy what you need to do 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.560
 you must put them all well 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.200
 obviously at a price buy now of 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.290
 2.400 as I said you will be thinking 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.370
 but it is not a powerful profit but an excuse 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.820
 what to say 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.510
 if you realize that you earn 500 for 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.480
 every piece 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.489
 I in a short time precisely while there 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.260
 I was talking I made the offer six players 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.299
 put also the case that it takes all 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.810
 manage to sell or roughly one 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.650
 gain of 3,000 for just say 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.370
 sorry for the 3000 I made in 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.200
 very little time because in a few seconds 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.519
 I made the offer the most studied Johnson 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.140
 in the event that he takes back all the stuff 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:47.000
 quite powerful then it is another 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.720
 I will use this video 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.150
 johnson soldier and systems on 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.079
 which in fact are all about 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.570
 2005 2000 and 2005 and succeed in fact in 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.900
 find them very easily powerfully 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.209
 at an initial price of 2 thousand anyway 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.070
 you will see everything in the video then you are 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.060
 noting that for example at some point 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:13.280
 with 10 thousand a point later I had 30 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.959
 thousand because I started recording 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.940
 how we try a little different I don't know 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.850
 but he writes about mamelio chigi 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.500
 comfortable to use than singing 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.970
 so we wanted to call it the cube catcher 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.039
 you may want to also give it to you 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.630
 only when you create them vivid video 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.160
 completely random numbers then 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.530
 powerful and 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.900
 and then messes everything then then 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.000
 another thing I wanted to say besides 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.600
 to specialize in 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.760
 specialize in finding your own 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.870
 favorite player for me is the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.660
 best method ever 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.760
 because obviously then you can do the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.350
 buying and selling as I showed you 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.730
 maybe picking up that between 250 and 350 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.050
 or by taking normal players e 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.760
 resell 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.430
 however for me it is that of aiming we put 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.520
 with these weapons a player and the accounts 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:10.490
 no it is not possible it is not possible not 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:15.580
 i can ok a player practically what 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:20.030
 that you need to talk as you can 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.680
 then it will serve you because you will know 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.330
 precisely all the prices or 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.430
 price changes of that player 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.660
 then another thing I wanted to tell you in 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.660
 this commentaries e 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.130
 one thing else that I have to tell you in 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.810
 these commentaries was that I will start 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.120
 precisely from this video to make gods 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.930
 contest what are perhaps many accounts 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.530
 of you think 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.880
 I have to do something powerful, yes 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.620
 in fact you have to do something powerful 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.890
 however, a fairly easy thing to take 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.140
 mind click pages and that's enough you leave 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.090
 a comment 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.920
 with powerful writing a palau e 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.960
 only powerful face participants speak 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.000
 then you want to write a powerful comment 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.640
 a palau and something you think of this 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.050
 video maybe a value or a defect of 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.990
 this video so you have to write 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.550
 present at the blade then put for example 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.990
 what did you really like what there is 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.280
 liked it or not so exactly in the 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.040
 next videos can improve to 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.410
 maximum and having put I like to be 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.580
 registered my channel and have entered 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.340
 video as a favorite 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.810
 how to insert video between favorites 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.330
 or indeed when you go on a video there is 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.610
 I like it adds to you do add 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.980
 then make favorites here is one thing 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.750
 quite powerfully easy and therefore 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.020
 because I ask you to do this 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.640
 you could practically do it yourself 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.980
 earn because after 12 videos now 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.110
 I will go to the random.org site 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.370
 I will put the number of total comments and 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:50.250
 this will extract a random number from me 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:54.240
 mister has a random number here 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.120
 I then against all the comments and the 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.700
 person who will comment on the video 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.170
 let's say now it doesn't really come to me 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.270
 because it is difficult achievements 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.610
 explain however in the sense that you want enough 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:09.390
 that comments the sea described my 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.730
 channel you will have mediated me gustan e 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.740
 you will have added videos to your favorites 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.230
 I will make the winner and the winner 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.550
 will take guys say good since the 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.500
 first episode there is one thing enough 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:23.220
 powerful well i ca n't suffer so much it is 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.530
 however the winner will take 15,000 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.180
 clinical claims seem so easy thing 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.520
 because you don't have to do anything you just have to 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.400
 have maximum taste write well on tap 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.320
 al has a merit and a flaw and or maybe 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.780
 also they are a merit and a defect so 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.270
 that in order to win 15 thousand credits 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.880
 now video skip them to 20 I remind you 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.710
 also 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.150
 if you have to fly anyway guys said 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:48.100
 this I greet you I hope you have 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:50.880
 however understood everything you see 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.880
 written in description
