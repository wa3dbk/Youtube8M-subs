00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
what's up guys and welcome to another

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.919 
what's up guys and welcome to another
jacket<00:00:01.979> tutorial<00:00:02.639> yes<00:00:03.330> so<00:00:03.540> now<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:03.840> going

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
jacket tutorial yes so now we're going

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.619 
jacket tutorial yes so now we're going
to<00:00:04.020> be<00:00:04.110> covering<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.440> mark<00:00:04.950> 5s<00:00:05.299> now<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.359> should

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
to be covering the mark 5s now we should

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.480 
to be covering the mark 5s now we should
note<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.350> couldn't<00:00:07.649> find<00:00:07.830> any<00:00:08.099> marked

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
note that we couldn't find any marked

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.000 
note that we couldn't find any marked
fours<00:00:08.929> we<00:00:09.929> were<00:00:10.050> just<00:00:10.080> looking<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.620> nargons

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
fours we were just looking in nargons

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.100 
fours we were just looking in nargons
reactors<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.420> couldn't<00:00:12.630> find<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:12.929> in

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
reactors but we couldn't find any in

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.919 
reactors but we couldn't find any in
general<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:15.150> difference<00:00:15.480> between<00:00:15.599> might

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
general the difference between might

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.599 
general the difference between might
force<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.379> white<00:00:16.500> fives<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.070> likewise

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
force and white fives is that likewise

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.460 
force and white fives is that likewise
meltdown<00:00:18.150> two<00:00:18.330> components<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> will<00:00:19.320> need

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
meltdown two components so you will need

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.400 
meltdown two components so you will need
to<00:00:19.529> make<00:00:19.830> more<00:00:20.240> cool<00:00:21.240> themselves<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.869> this

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
to make more cool themselves in this

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.679 
to make more cool themselves in this
Purser's<00:00:22.890> now<00:00:23.609> these<00:00:23.760> don't<00:00:24.000> last<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> huge

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
Purser's now these don't last for a huge

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.120 
Purser's now these don't last for a huge
amount<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.990> time<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.380> require<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> huge

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
amount of time and they require a huge

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.790 
amount of time and they require a huge
cool<00:00:26.519> down<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> first<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:28.680> going

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
cool down so the first one we're going

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.209 
cool down so the first one we're going
to<00:00:28.859> show<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.580> mark<00:00:30.320> 55<00:00:31.320> feet<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.099> this

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
to show you is it mark 55 feet and this

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.580 
to show you is it mark 55 feet and this
is<00:00:32.340> an<00:00:32.430> efficiency<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.969> three<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.809> takes<00:00:34.079> 18

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
is an efficiency of three it takes 18

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
is an efficiency of three it takes 18
uranium<00:00:35.070> cells<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.730> creates<00:00:36.000> 540<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.050> use

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
uranium cells and it creates 540 you use

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.619 
uranium cells and it creates 540 you use
per<00:00:37.530> ticket<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.700> up<00:00:39.000> set<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.480> right

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
per ticket so this is up set up right

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.350 
per ticket so this is up set up right
there<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.110> should<00:00:40.440> only<00:00:40.559> run<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.879> 10

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
there and you should only run it for 10

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
there and you should only run it for 10
minutes<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.750> 25<00:00:43.050> seconds<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
minutes and 25 seconds and you have to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.000 
minutes and 25 seconds and you have to
cool<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.090> down<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.750> an<00:00:45.960> hour<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.440> 15<00:00:46.800> minutes

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
cool it down for an hour and 15 minutes

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.610 
cool it down for an hour and 15 minutes
so<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.450> sure<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:49.020> runtime

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so just make sure that your runtime

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
so just make sure that your runtime
isn't<00:00:50.190> any<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.610> than<00:00:50.760> 600<00:00:51.270> 25<00:00:51.660> seconds<00:00:53.360> so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
isn't any more than 600 25 seconds so

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
isn't any more than 600 25 seconds so
we're<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> move<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> another<00:00:55.489> mark

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
we're going to move on to another mark

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.660 
we're going to move on to another mark
5b<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.170> bit<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.500> efficient<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
5b but it's a bit more efficient so the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
5b but it's a bit more efficient so the
efficiency<00:01:00.090> 3.1<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
efficiency 3.1 so a little bit more and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
efficiency 3.1 so a little bit more and
it<00:01:02.520> takes<00:01:02.699> 20<00:01:03.149> uranium<00:01:03.600> cells<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.860> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it takes 20 uranium cells it's going to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.630 
it takes 20 uranium cells it's going to
be<00:01:04.979> making<00:01:05.150> 620<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.540> per<00:01:06.720> tick<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:08.490> runs

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
be making 620 you per tick and it runs

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.969 
be making 620 you per tick and it runs
for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> same<00:01:09.210> amount<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.420> time<00:01:09.530> 625<00:01:10.530> seconds

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
for the same amount of time 625 seconds

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
for the same amount of time 625 seconds
but<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.310> cool<00:01:11.520> down<00:01:11.549> its<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.360> hour<00:01:12.510> 35

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
but they cool down its up an hour 35

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.740 
but they cool down its up an hour 35
minutes<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.860> 25<00:01:14.310> minutes<00:01:14.640> longer<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
minutes so 25 minutes longer so it's a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
minutes so 25 minutes longer so it's a
little<00:01:15.930> more<00:01:16.049> efficient<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> few<00:01:16.799> more<00:01:16.920> cells

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
little more efficient a few more cells

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.550 
little more efficient a few more cells
lots<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.880> more<00:01:18.030> power<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> takes<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.439> little

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
lots of more power but it takes a little

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.090 
lots of more power but it takes a little
bit<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> cool<00:01:20.220> down<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> guys<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bit more to cool down so guys will I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.830 
bit more to cool down so guys will I
think<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> last<00:01:24.659> video

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
think this is going to be the last video

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
think this is going to be the last video
on<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.140> server<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> we'll<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:25.979> moving<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
on this server and we'll be moving on to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.230 
on this server and we'll be moving on to
a<00:01:26.610> new<00:01:26.640> server<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.210> make<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:28.100> no<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.820> turtles

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
a new server to make up no the turtles

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
a new server to make up no the turtles
and<00:01:30.479> advanced<00:01:30.960> films<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.890> did<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and advanced films now we did all of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.380 
and advanced films now we did all of
this<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.689> server<00:01:33.960> legit<00:01:35.180> but<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
this on this server legit but on the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.310 
this on this server legit but on the
next<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.720> we're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.079> spawning

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
next one we're going to be spawning

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.810 
next one we're going to be spawning
things<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.400> don't<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
things in because we just don't have the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.289 
things in because we just don't have the
time<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.200> put<00:01:40.200> into<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.490> easier<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
time to put into that and easier want to

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.200 
time to put into that and easier want to
see<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> us<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:44.159> stuff<00:01:44.220> legit<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
see you us to do stuff legit then you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.190 
see you us to do stuff legit then you

everything<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.159> isn't<00:01:53.430> going

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
everything that we do there isn't going

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370 
everything that we do there isn't going
to<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.119> goes<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.600> camera<00:01:54.899> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to be much that goes on off camera just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.030 
to be much that goes on off camera just
the<00:01:55.500> boring<00:01:55.799> stuff<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> yeah<00:01:58.409> we'll<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.829> moving

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the boring stuff so yeah we'll be moving

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.940 
the boring stuff so yeah we'll be moving
on<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.430> than<00:01:59.670> your<00:01:59.820> server<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.310> see<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.369> there

on to than your server and see you there

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.260 
on to than your server and see you there
ok<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.250> we're<00:02:05.399> over<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.820> our<00:02:06.060> other

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
ok so now we're over here in our other

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
ok so now we're over here in our other
server<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.619> we're<00:02:07.710> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.950> showing<00:02:08.099> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
server and we're going to be showing you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.609 
server and we're going to be showing you
a<00:02:08.310> breeder<00:02:08.640> absolutely<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.750> when<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.410> we're

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
a breeder absolutely so when now we're

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.660 
a breeder absolutely so when now we're
actually<00:02:10.770> using<00:02:10.950> Tekkit<00:02:11.520> three

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
actually using Tekkit three

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.640 
actually using Tekkit three
and<00:02:12.790> we'll<00:02:13.450> show<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:14.050> new<00:02:14.230> item<00:02:14.500> here

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and we'll show you this new item here

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.680 
and we'll show you this new item here
called<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.980> thermometer<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:16.510> so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
called a thermometer right so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.089 
called a thermometer right so
thermometer<00:02:17.319> when<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.680> right-click<00:02:17.860> a

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
thermometer when you right-click a

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.740 
thermometer when you right-click a
reactor<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.670> gives<00:02:18.849> you<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.060> temperature<00:02:19.569> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
reactor it gives you the temperature and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.089 
reactor it gives you the temperature and
it<00:02:20.230> also<00:02:20.380> gives<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.830> little<00:02:20.980> more

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
it also gives you a little more

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.410 
it also gives you a little more
information<00:02:21.730> when<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:21.910> use<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.120> digital

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
information when you use a digital

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
information when you use a digital
thermometer<00:02:23.190> digital<00:02:24.190> one<00:02:24.340> also<00:02:24.730> needs<00:02:24.760> cell

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
thermometer digital one also needs cell

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.500 
thermometer digital one also needs cell
to<00:02:26.440> be<00:02:26.560> charged<00:02:26.800> with<00:02:27.040> them<00:02:27.280> EU<00:02:28.030> it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
to be charged with them EU it's

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.350 
to be charged with them EU it's
basically<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.040> electric<00:02:30.040> tool<00:02:30.400> equivalent

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
basically the electric tool equivalent

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.070 
basically the electric tool equivalent
of<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.810> thermometer<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.739> requires<00:02:33.100> power<00:02:34.080> so

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
of the thermometer so requires power so

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.479 
of the thermometer so requires power so
on<00:02:35.410> here<00:02:35.770> we're<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.130> show<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.340> how<00:02:36.370> to

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
on here we're going to show you how to

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.420 
on here we're going to show you how to
make<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:37.120> year<00:02:37.600> end<00:02:37.720> result<00:02:37.989> from<00:02:38.350> your<00:02:39.220> wrist

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
make a a year end result from your wrist

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.670 
make a a year end result from your wrist
one<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.569> take<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> near<00:02:41.050> depleted<00:02:41.500> when<00:02:41.530> we

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
one so you take a near depleted when we

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.710 
one so you take a near depleted when we
put<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.920> next<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.160> coal<00:02:42.400> dust<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
put it next to coal dust and you get a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.140 
put it next to coal dust and you get a
rear<00:02:44.110> each<00:02:44.349> still<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:45.160> my<00:02:45.519> body<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.880> put<00:02:46.060> it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
rear each still on my body if you put it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.420 
rear each still on my body if you put it
I<00:02:46.239> suppose<00:02:46.300> ice<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.989> upsell<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.250> put

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
I suppose ice to upsell and then you put

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.430 
I suppose ice to upsell and then you put
the<00:02:48.580> re<00:02:48.790> enriched<00:02:49.120> one<00:02:49.390> next<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.050> coal<00:02:50.230> dust

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
the re enriched one next to coal dust

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.470 
the re enriched one next to coal dust
again<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:50.950> creates<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.280> uranium<00:02:51.519> cell<00:02:51.910> now

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
again and it creates a uranium cell now

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.350 
again and it creates a uranium cell now
to<00:02:52.540> go<00:02:52.959> from<00:02:53.310> depleted<00:02:54.310> isotope<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.970> re<00:02:55.209> and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
to go from depleted isotope to re and

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.729 
to go from depleted isotope to re and
riched<00:02:55.540> you're<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.290> need<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.440> breeding

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
riched you're going to need a breeding

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.090 
riched you're going to need a breeding
reactor<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.299> bed<00:02:58.750> reactor<00:02:59.440> first<00:02:59.920> needs

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
reactor so the bed reactor first needs

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.350 
reactor so the bed reactor first needs
to<00:03:00.190> be<00:03:00.280> heated<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:01.030> gonna<00:03:01.239> be<00:03:01.299> your

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
to be heated and this gonna be your

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.539 
to be heated and this gonna be your
heating<00:03:01.720> setup<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.799> those<00:03:02.980> four<00:03:03.190> buckets

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
heating setup so those four buckets

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.770 
heating setup so those four buckets
represent<00:03:04.230> regular<00:03:05.230> uranium<00:03:05.709> cells<00:03:06.720> now<00:03:07.720> we

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
represent regular uranium cells now we

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.690 
represent regular uranium cells now we
will<00:03:08.080> note<00:03:08.350> that<00:03:08.380> this<00:03:08.680> didn't<00:03:09.160> quite<00:03:09.459> work

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
will note that this didn't quite work

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.759 
will note that this didn't quite work
for<00:03:09.760> us<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:10.299> that's<00:03:10.510> because<00:03:10.780> we<00:03:11.080> when<00:03:11.680> you

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
for us but that's because we when you

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.190 
for us but that's because we when you
spawn<00:03:12.069> in<00:03:12.280> nuclear<00:03:12.730> components<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.989> game

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
spawn in nuclear components in this game

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.800 
spawn in nuclear components in this game
they<00:03:14.440> don't<00:03:14.709> really<00:03:14.980> work<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.459> same<00:03:15.640> way<00:03:15.810> so

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
they don't really work the same way so

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.690 
they don't really work the same way so
in<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.470> hidden<00:03:17.739> configuration<00:03:18.340> should<00:03:18.579> be

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
in the hidden configuration should be

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.170 
in the hidden configuration should be
making<00:03:18.850> Elgin<00:03:19.480> 20aug<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:21.730> have<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.030> heat

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
making Elgin 20aug and you have to heat

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.060 
making Elgin 20aug and you have to heat
it<00:03:22.209> up<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.570> nine<00:03:22.780> thousand<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.500> ten<00:03:23.650> thousand

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
it up to nine thousand to ten thousand

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.849 
it up to nine thousand to ten thousand
heat<00:03:24.250> which<00:03:24.609> is<00:03:24.640> takes<00:03:25.269> 35<00:03:25.870> minutes<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.500> four

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
heat which is takes 35 minutes and four

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.670 
heat which is takes 35 minutes and four
seconds<00:03:27.250> now<00:03:28.030> notice<00:03:28.299> our<00:03:28.690> heat<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.230> going<00:03:29.440> up

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
seconds now notice our heat is going up

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.610 
seconds now notice our heat is going up
here<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.359> also<00:03:31.480> put<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.840> loud<00:03:32.019> buckets<00:03:32.440> to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
here you can also put in loud buckets to

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.120 
here you can also put in loud buckets to
give<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.920> faster<00:03:33.430> each<00:03:33.609> lava<00:03:33.970> bucket<00:03:34.180> at

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
give you a faster each lava bucket at

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.979 
give you a faster each lava bucket at
162<00:03:36.130> heat<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.730> think<00:03:38.370> right<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:39.640> basically<00:03:40.480> the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
162 heat I think right so basically the

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.229 
162 heat I think right so basically the
run<00:03:41.200> time<00:03:41.440> for<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.160> get<00:03:42.280> about<00:03:42.579> two<00:03:42.910> nine

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
run time for this to get about two nine

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.819 
run time for this to get about two nine
thousand<00:03:43.930> HD<00:03:44.079> ah<00:03:45.329> takes<00:03:46.329> about<00:03:46.510> 35<00:03:47.079> minutes<00:03:47.440> 4

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
thousand HD ah takes about 35 minutes 4

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.430 
thousand HD ah takes about 35 minutes 4
seconds<00:03:48.280> when<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.910> water<00:03:49.299> running<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.410> I

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
seconds when you have water running so I

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.110 
seconds when you have water running so I
if<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:50.829> take<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> water<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.850> little

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
if you take out the water it's a little

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.610 
if you take out the water it's a little
bit<00:03:52.209> less<00:03:52.359> time<00:03:52.600> but<00:03:52.870> it's<00:03:52.989> not<00:03:53.140> really<00:03:53.350> worth

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
bit less time but it's not really worth

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.910 
bit less time but it's not really worth
it<00:03:53.829> if<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.220> have<00:03:54.370> any<00:03:54.549> troubles<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.590> this

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
it if you have any troubles so and this

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.130 
it if you have any troubles so and this
new<00:03:57.250> one<00:03:57.489> here<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.209> breather

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
new one here is the breather

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.740 
new one here is the breather
configuration<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.069> those<00:04:00.640> are<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.269> buddha

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
configuration and those are the buddha

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.599 
configuration and those are the buddha
isotope<00:04:02.170> souls<00:04:02.440> became<00:04:02.739> real<00:04:02.980> rich<00:04:03.190> stories

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
isotope souls became real rich stories

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.120 
isotope souls became real rich stories
so<00:04:04.269> they<00:04:04.600> almost<00:04:04.840> immediately<00:04:05.560> after<00:04:05.799> putting

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
so they almost immediately after putting

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.650 
so they almost immediately after putting
them<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.459> worked<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.630> became<00:04:08.310> rien<00:04:09.310> riched

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
them in worked and became rien riched

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.509 
them in worked and became rien riched
but<00:04:10.660> that's<00:04:10.810> because<00:04:11.019> again<00:04:11.530> we<00:04:11.709> said<00:04:11.950> it

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
but that's because again we said it

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.400 
but that's because again we said it
wasn't<00:04:13.150> really<00:04:13.389> working<00:04:13.569> that<00:04:13.750> well<00:04:14.109> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
wasn't really working that well and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.250 
wasn't really working that well and
because<00:04:15.040> of<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.400> spawning<00:04:16.329> things<00:04:16.600> but<00:04:17.049> it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
because of the spawning things but it

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.289 
because of the spawning things but it
should<00:04:17.680> take<00:04:17.889> more<00:04:18.070> time<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.519> be<00:04:18.850> more<00:04:19.060> heat

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
should take more time and be more heat

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.080 
should take more time and be more heat
that<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.600> have<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:21.340> better<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.909> is

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
that you have the better it is

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.640 
that you have the better it is
ridiculous<00:04:22.960> now<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.470> breeding

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
ridiculous now in the breeding

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.230 
ridiculous now in the breeding
configuration<00:04:24.310> shouldn't<00:04:24.789> actually<00:04:24.970> be

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
configuration shouldn't actually be

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.010 
configuration shouldn't actually be
losing

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
losing

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.140 
losing
you<00:04:26.770> only<00:04:26.919> need<00:04:27.099> to<00:04:27.190> use<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.400> heating<00:04:27.759> one<00:04:27.910> and

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
you only need to use the heating one and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.760 
you only need to use the heating one and
then<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.330> should<00:04:28.539> stay<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.050> exact<00:04:29.349> same<00:04:29.530> heat

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
then it should stay the exact same heat

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.980 
then it should stay the exact same heat
all<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:29.949> time<00:04:30.069> but<00:04:30.729> because<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.509> not<00:04:31.660> rien

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
all the time but because it's not rien

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.360 
all the time but because it's not rien
reaching<00:04:32.259> the<00:04:32.379> cells<00:04:32.620> in<00:04:32.800> our<00:04:32.889> case<00:04:33.160> it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
reaching the cells in our case it

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.339 
reaching the cells in our case it
started<00:04:33.759> to<00:04:33.849> lose<00:04:34.030> heat<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.479> want<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.259> to

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
forget these things yep so now we're

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.520 
forget these things yep so now we're
going<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.310> do<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> little<00:04:57.520> bit<00:04:57.849> of<00:04:58.530> myth-busting

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
going to do a little bit of myth-busting

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.649 
going to do a little bit of myth-busting
I<00:04:59.650> guess<00:04:59.860> yeah<00:05:00.520> we're<00:05:00.759> bucking<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.150> old

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
I guess yeah we're bucking the old

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.860 
I guess yeah we're bucking the old
server<00:05:01.990> asking<00:05:02.770> like<00:05:02.889> goodbye<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.870> and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
server asking like goodbye to it and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.570 
server asking like goodbye to it and
we're<00:05:05.050> testing<00:05:05.440> if<00:05:05.530> G&amp;T<00:05:05.830> will<00:05:06.130> pull<00:05:06.340> up<00:05:06.430> a

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
we're testing if G&amp;T will pull up a

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.510 
we're testing if G&amp;T will pull up a
reactor<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.569> we'll<00:05:08.080> make<00:05:08.349> it<00:05:08.380> go<00:05:08.740> off<00:05:08.949> now

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
reactor like we'll make it go off now

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.920 
reactor like we'll make it go off now
I'm<00:05:09.639> pretty<00:05:09.909> sure<00:05:10.180> someone<00:05:10.449> asked<00:05:10.810> this

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
I'm pretty sure someone asked this

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.170 
I'm pretty sure someone asked this
question<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.590> us<00:05:11.620> in<00:05:12.280> this<00:05:12.460> case<00:05:12.639> it<00:05:12.819> just<00:05:12.849> blew

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
question to us in this case it just blew

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.309 
question to us in this case it just blew
up<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.419> components<00:05:13.930> as<00:05:14.020> if<00:05:14.139> they<00:05:14.259> were

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
up the components as if they were

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.170 
up the components as if they were
anything<00:05:14.560> else<00:05:14.830> yeah<00:05:15.009> only<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.520> CNT<00:05:15.880> blew<00:05:16.030> up

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
anything else yeah only it CNT blew up

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.839 
anything else yeah only it CNT blew up
the<00:05:16.360> actual<00:05:16.569> reactor<00:05:16.870> didn't<00:05:17.530> go<00:05:17.889> off<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.430> it

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
the actual reactor didn't go off and it

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.879 
the actual reactor didn't go off and it
was<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.030> running<00:05:19.509> reactor<00:05:20.020> keep<00:05:20.469> that<00:05:20.650> in<00:05:20.740> mind

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
was a running reactor keep that in mind

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.200 
was a running reactor keep that in mind
yeah<00:05:21.190> you're<00:05:21.909> right<00:05:22.000> sauce<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:22.449> it<00:05:23.909> right<00:05:24.909> so

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
yeah you're right sauce in it right so

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.760 
yeah you're right sauce in it right so
now<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.569> we<00:05:25.659> know<00:05:25.690> that<00:05:26.169> this<00:05:26.409> isn't<00:05:26.650> going

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
now that we know that this isn't going

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.469 
now that we know that this isn't going
to<00:05:26.919> work<00:05:26.979> we're<00:05:27.699> going<00:05:27.819> to<00:05:27.879> move<00:05:28.030> on<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.210> try

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
to work we're going to move on and try

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.120 
to work we're going to move on and try
it<00:05:28.599> again<00:05:28.719> yeah<00:05:29.409> we're<00:05:29.560> going<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.740> step<00:05:29.949> it<00:05:30.069> up

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
it again yeah we're going to step it up

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:42.600 
it again yeah we're going to step it up
a<00:05:30.280> bit<00:05:30.310> with<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.150> up<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.300> nuke

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.149 

right<00:05:43.509> so<00:05:43.689> now<00:05:43.810> we've<00:05:43.960> got<00:05:44.169> a<00:05:44.349> nuke<00:05:44.650> next<00:05:45.069> to<00:05:45.129> a

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
right so now we've got a nuke next to a

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.969 
right so now we've got a nuke next to a
TNT<00:05:45.729> we've<00:05:46.479> also<00:05:46.629> got<00:05:46.930> another<00:05:46.960> reactor<00:05:47.800> here

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
TNT we've also got another reactor here

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.820 
TNT we've also got another reactor here
just<00:05:48.909> in<00:05:49.000> case<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.210> nuke<00:05:49.479> does<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:50.259> we<00:05:50.650> do

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
just in case a nuke does it so we do

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.309 
just in case a nuke does it so we do
know<00:05:51.039> that<00:05:51.069> nukes<00:05:51.610> go<00:05:51.969> off<00:05:52.180> when<00:05:52.569> I<00:05:52.840> can't

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
know that nukes go off when I can't

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.839 
know that nukes go off when I can't
expose<00:05:53.710> next<00:05:54.129> three<00:05:54.280> so<00:05:54.370> we're<00:05:54.460> just<00:05:54.490> going<00:05:54.789> to

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
expose next three so we're just going to

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.580 
expose next three so we're just going to
show<00:05:55.509> you<00:05:55.569> that<00:05:57.539> so<00:05:58.539> here<00:05:58.689> we<00:05:58.780> go<00:05:58.810> there<00:05:59.409> goes

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
show you that so here we go there goes

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.740 
show you that so here we go there goes
the<00:05:59.620> TNT<00:06:00.219> and<00:06:00.430> now<00:06:01.389> the<00:06:01.449> nuke<00:06:02.789> and<00:06:03.789> there's<00:06:04.689> a

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
the TNT and now the nuke and there's a

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.809 
the TNT and now the nuke and there's a
goodbye<00:06:04.960> to<00:06:05.139> our<00:06:05.319> server<00:06:05.620> and<00:06:05.949> once<00:06:06.520> again<00:06:06.639> you

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819

saw<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.150> pretty<00:06:07.449> much<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:07.750> same<00:06:07.900> thing<00:06:07.960> here

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 
saw the pretty much the same thing here

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.279 
saw the pretty much the same thing here
when<00:06:08.590> you<00:06:08.710> use<00:06:08.830> a<00:06:08.860> nuke<00:06:09.159> or<00:06:09.879> a<00:06:09.939> TNT<00:06:10.629> or<00:06:10.659> anything

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
when you use a nuke or a TNT or anything

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.260 
when you use a nuke or a TNT or anything
to<00:06:11.409> explode<00:06:11.740> your<00:06:11.830> reactor<00:06:12.310> it<00:06:12.819> doesn't<00:06:13.150> have

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
to explode your reactor it doesn't have

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.679 
to explode your reactor it doesn't have
any<00:06:13.419> kind<00:06:13.689> of<00:06:13.810> extremely<00:06:14.740> dangerous<00:06:15.689> effects

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:16.689 
any kind of extremely dangerous effects

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.950 
any kind of extremely dangerous effects
yeah<00:06:16.990> the<00:06:17.139> reactor<00:06:17.500> won't<00:06:17.740> blow<00:06:17.949> up<00:06:18.779> just<00:06:19.779> up

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
yeah the reactor won't blow up just up

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.600 
yeah the reactor won't blow up just up
that<00:06:20.229> holes<00:06:20.469> for<00:06:20.620> my<00:06:20.680> new<00:06:20.830> they<00:06:21.159> react<00:06:21.430> with

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
that holes for my new they react with

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.830 
that holes for my new they react with
much<00:06:21.729> much<00:06:21.939> bigger<00:06:22.150> as<00:06:22.979> you've<00:06:23.979> probably<00:06:24.009> seen

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
much much bigger as you've probably seen
