00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 girls hello and today I have 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.990
 there was a free minute I want 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.420
 answer those questions you are interested in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.370
 which we asked to do so 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 do not take long to execute your 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.109
 request he called me and channels around 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 I honestly say I have never heard of 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.050
 so you're in trouble but when I follow 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 I wrote Bella in search and so big 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
 the girl list has long been taking it off 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.590
 many read their questions turn out not to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.539
 so so interesting it is pretty 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.160
 did give detailed answers but I 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.600
 I'll try not to talk too much 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 delay because 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.550
 not to make more length seen 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 so let's probably find new ones 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.950
 beauty channel and find 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.680
 Of course girls I find for example when 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.870
 recommendations do not fall away when I watch it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 videos like the videos themselves are interesting 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.280
 the subject is interesting to be a girl 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 will open a video and be sure to subscribe 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.250
 if she is simple open 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.739
 talks about something interesting the same 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 what is not interested if you are all looking 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.710
 video your glue 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.309
 hold if not so what are the criteria 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 selection I try to watch everything but 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 girls me 220 somewhere subscriptions from 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.610
 half need to unsubscribe from barking vividly 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.540
 bloggers are somehow fed up with them all 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.950
 on the same wavelength 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 water will leave the units probably and therefore I 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.090
 Many videos are skipping of course just 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.330
 it's not enough time for this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 what are the selection criteria well when me 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.540
 interesting topic for example and calf 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.939
 for a moment i shop which i'm straight 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.700
 waiting on this blogger or 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.590
 Well, what I need for example 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 information which case would not 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.870
 watch the girls video I'm 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.950
 mainly 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.680
 all these in her which i have 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.660
 stories including always to the end 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.910
 maximum sometime when the carriage can I 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.200
 scroll if there can be some wear 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.320
 tells the product and I'm not interested 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 and period 20 before the palace 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.480
 also so physically time to watch everything 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.460
 everything 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.040
 and at the same time I want to see everyone and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.920
 other girls she what video immediately 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.950
 turn off I see that the name is not 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.540
 corresponds to the video as it is not 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.960
 somehow a little bit repulsive why 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.780
 some kind of self-deception is obtained further 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.990
 advertising before before during and after 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.120
 video how do you feel about this 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.840
 girls I am okay to advertise 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.030
 before the video and please after the video well 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.460
 that's it during me annoying 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 do you always reply to comments 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.460
 girls always 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.110
 even if someone didn’t answer something 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.090
 tanne on and just maybe straight what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.390
 then maybe I didn't see maybe 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.760
 somewhere we may have missed and don’t know 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.500
 Do I always try to make it seem to me 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.120
 people waiting, he wrote so I imagine 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.680
 I always leave the other in place 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.600
 imagine not to be too 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.940
 nice just if the person is aut 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.610
 coming girls question do you read 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.280
 comment under video to other bloggers yes 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.080
 but this is rarely of course unless you drop it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.860
 interested video for example on you 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.230
 someone wrote turned girl video 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.150
 some product and can be read 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.280
 below reviews about it happen something too 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.709
 see and reads with smoother it did not fit 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.870
 or all time such oily skin amentia 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.120
 then I do not ask here in such cases I 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.340
 clean and the video you reviewed 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.150
 twice and even more yes there are girls 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.670
 me even these videos are added in 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.620
 countries but I will say it right away 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.510
 video with makeup and which i like 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.760
 I want to repeat the next question dozens 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.829
 was it that they unsubscribed 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.659
 some channel why of course there was 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.819
 I used to quite often 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.269
 signed later but I stopped 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.030
 like this man but don't know either 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.489
 I have nothing special to him, and somehow I 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.560
 I understand that I no longer want to inflict 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.819
 u just already tastes don't argue and on 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.040
 second moment why i happen 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.480
 unsubscribe her earlier and now minutes 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.489
 will clean again the list as I have already 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.290
 said at the beginning of the video this is us because 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.079
 that a person changes becomes somehow 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.030
 others about sense arrogant throw ponte 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.639
 but sorry on the image is notarized 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.939
 so there are such channels i love people chip 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.659
 who remain in the senate to their wave 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.139
 I hope you got what I meant 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.379
 further name three favorite channels 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.810
 both are this tough question because 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.609
 the one and only one is my favorite channel 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.829
 on youtube is a hundred percent and anonymous 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:14.170
 below I will leave a link to this topic 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.419
 if i correctly call it english 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:22.479
 a blogger is just a beautiful girl 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:25.240
 just super and does makeup on and 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.160
 open such she has there to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.870
 to myself 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.030
 2 3 would channel like william 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.909
 give and market outposts links to not 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.030
 because I forgot their panic can here 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:41.789
 Further, in your opinion is the main 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.180
 component of a successful video seems to me 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.889
 information kindness disposition 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.409
 openness is man as he is 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.310
 no need to pose as yourself why you don't 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.880
 imagine either trying to say times 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.660
 this 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.850
 you kind of be and like you here 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.650
 there are always pleasant and interesting lives 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.860
 watch these different people 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.000
 I think it means a lot further like 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.660
 you developed 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.540
 and develop your channel your chip 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.270
 share a secret I will not tell more 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.640
 what to develop my channel do not have me 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.010
 many watch before the taxi I heard from them 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.710
 do not write them your trick is your hair 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.370
 I do n’t know why see for yourself 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.440
 Aida is probably my how I started as 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.960
 budget and efficiently and simply these 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.410
 Here are all the tips that are related and beauty 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.110
 secrets really like girls and me 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.280
 I will continue to take off 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.160
 many come to my channel to 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.860
 look at these videos further signed 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.260
 Are you on the channel and other topics I 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.030
 sign in what m. 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.040
 and somehow very much a man there two please 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.280
 there they tell us about the different chips and 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.550
 different programs 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.620
 light to adjust the camera well and 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.960
 musical this channel and what mistakes 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.540
 worth avoiding or creating a video 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.390
 girls it seems to me the speech is the most 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:13.540
 the main thing is if a person speaks very badly 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.510
 I still have it, I know it’s not 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.730
 very bad myself so i have before 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.640
 it was even worse but I try and try 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.790
 changing myself looking at myself 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.710
 Well, more or less neat kind of here 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.570
 This is the first thing you meet on 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.880
 clothes you spend native comments 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.770
 what was your reaction this of course 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.029
 were 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.949
 very rarely pelvis I'm already on somehow 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.469
 the previous video did say who is not 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.529
 I looked again girls 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:46.339
 if they write me for example, that's it 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:50.360
 negative unfounded met somehow 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:52.819
 tried calmly what you didn't like 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.919
 don't look for example or something else 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.929
 it is people like the opposite even 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.089
 gets them starts to answer and back 

00:06:56.929 --> 00:07:01.069
 and not to enter this dialogue I just 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:03.439
 now no answer at all see no point 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:05.029
 I just block all kinds of dislikes and 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.909
 Are they important comments for you? 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:10.159
 girls end point without this wine 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:12.469
 on the feed back some reaction 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:15.499
 there are some videos like this 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:17.419
 I should not take pictures, I do not know 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:19.999
 do you like the drum? 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.649
 hooked me off there especially well 

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:24.069
 there you can view the viewing time 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:26.959
 video but still not figure it out 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.909
 therefore, it is clear that if a person watched 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:31.129
 the video did not watch it maybe 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.360
 This future interests further pulls 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.490
 exactly again shoot something 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.469
 I want to tell my channel 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.469
 also the same again of course important 

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:41.809
 because it is your support and always 

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:44.449
 thank you girls so much 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:45.349
 thank you for taking the time 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.289
 my channel 

00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:51.589
 under my video yet spend some 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:52.490
 a piece of my life just like me on 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:55.039
 that's all for now 

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.069
 see you next videos and everyone 

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.069
 until
