00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
computers the very first to feature it

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.650 
computers the very first to feature it
and<00:00:10.950> they<00:00:11.519> did<00:00:11.730> not<00:00:11.880> disappoint<00:00:12.090> or

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
and they did not disappoint or

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.320 
and they did not disappoint or
shortchange<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.469> they<00:00:13.559> went<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> 5k<00:00:14.580> panel

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
shortchange it they went with a 5k panel

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
shortchange it they went with a 5k panel
yes<00:00:15.560> 5k<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.039> went<00:00:17.220> ahead<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.580> skipped

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
yes 5k they just went ahead and skipped

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330 
yes 5k they just went ahead and skipped
over<00:00:17.940> 4k<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> has<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> resolution<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.980> 50

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.390 
main computer but I went with this base
model<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.439> how<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> performance<00:01:05.250> is

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
model just to see how the performance is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
know mostly for the average consumer out

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.310 
know mostly for the average consumer out
there<00:01:17.280> especially<00:01:17.640> started<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.330> $2,500

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
there especially started off at $2,500

tests and just my first impressions

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
tests and just my first impressions
coming<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.040> another<00:01:23.159> video<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.450> plug

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
coming up in another video but as I plug

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
coming up in another video but as I plug
this<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:26.009> time<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
this in for the very first time and I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.940 
this in for the very first time and I
power<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.509> computer<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.259> take<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
power on the computer and just take a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
just I was about to say something else

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
just I was about to say something else
but<00:01:33.990> everything<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.220> pops<00:01:35.640> off<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
but everything just really pops off the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
but everything just really pops off the
screen<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.439> hard<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> show<00:01:37.770> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
screen and it's kind of hard to show on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.950 
screen and it's kind of hard to show on
the<00:01:38.250> video<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.450> best<00:01:39.659> display

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the video but this is the best display

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
the video but this is the best display
that<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> personally<00:01:40.770> looked<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> person

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909

and maybe better ones out there on the
market<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> best<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
