00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
I ever get into this but then when it's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.260 
I ever get into this but then when it's
out<00:02:02.470> running<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.010> makes<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.370> all<00:02:03.490> worthwhile

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
out running it makes it all worthwhile
