frames<00:00:29.460> per<00:00:29.640> second<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.539> that's<00:00:30.660> good

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:48.090 

yeah<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.840> try<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> skip<00:00:37.489> all<00:00:38.489> that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.430 

and<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:49.090> figure<00:00:49.540> out<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.720> sound<00:00:49.930> because<00:00:50.200> it<00:00:50.350> is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
and I figure out the sound because it is

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.030 
and I figure out the sound because it is
kind<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.770> choppy<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:52.090> I<00:00:52.390> just<00:00:53.380> left<00:00:53.620> it<00:00:53.739> so<00:00:53.920> I'd

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
kind of choppy so I just left it so I'd

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.590 
kind of choppy so I just left it so I'd
be<00:00:54.160> able<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.309> have<00:00:54.489> two<00:00:54.610> gameplay<00:00:55.090> more<00:00:55.390> and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
be able to have two gameplay more and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.810

the<00:00:55.930> graphics<00:00:56.379> are<00:00:56.500> great<00:00:56.739> because<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.640> the

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
the graphics are great because of the

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.600 
the graphics are great because of the
Intel<00:00:58.720> I<00:00:59.020> may<00:00:59.500> not<00:00:59.650> the<00:00:59.770> Intel<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.220> graphics
