00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hey I welcome to a next video lesson

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.440 
hey I welcome to a next video lesson
with<00:00:05.040> Sun<00:00:05.279> Studio<00:00:05.700> today<00:00:06.000> we're<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.359> to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
with Sun Studio today we're going to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.120 
with Sun Studio today we're going to
talk<00:00:06.629> about<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.080> three<00:00:07.350> most<00:00:07.529> important

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
talk about the three most important

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.190 
talk about the three most important
settings<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:08.700> camera<00:00:08.960> namely<00:00:09.960> shutter

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
settings in your camera namely shutter

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.459 
settings in your camera namely shutter
speed<00:00:10.620> ISO<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.639> aperture<00:00:12.090> let's<00:00:13.049> start<00:00:13.320> with

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
speed ISO and aperture let's start with

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.829 
speed ISO and aperture let's start with
a<00:00:13.500> shutter<00:00:13.769> speed<00:00:14.360> shutter<00:00:15.360> speed<00:00:15.660> or

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
a shutter speed shutter speed or

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.960 
a shutter speed shutter speed or
exposure<00:00:16.440> time<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> time<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.640> camera

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
exposure time is a time the camera

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.000 
exposure time is a time the camera
shutter<00:00:18.210> opens

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.700 

now<00:00:21.939> how<00:00:22.180> fast<00:00:22.539> should<00:00:22.900> you<00:00:23.109> set<00:00:23.380> your<00:00:23.529> shutter

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
now how fast should you set your shutter

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.249 
now how fast should you set your shutter
speed<00:00:23.859> on<00:00:24.310> your<00:00:24.460> camera<00:00:24.849> when<00:00:25.029> filming<00:00:25.259> the

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
speed on your camera when filming the

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.349 
speed on your camera when filming the
basic<00:00:26.619> rule<00:00:26.830> called<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.250> 180<00:00:27.910> degrees

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
basic rule called the 180 degrees

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.689 
basic rule called the 180 degrees
shutter<00:00:28.750> rule<00:00:29.020> is<00:00:29.259> that<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.099> use<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.400> double

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
shutter rule is that you use the double

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.630 
shutter rule is that you use the double
of<00:00:30.849> your<00:00:31.000> frame<00:00:31.240> rate<00:00:31.290> now<00:00:32.290> let's<00:00:32.920> say<00:00:33.129> we<00:00:33.400> use

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
of your frame rate now let's say we use

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.700 
of your frame rate now let's say we use
24<00:00:34.180> frames<00:00:34.449> per<00:00:34.540> second<00:00:35.079> that<00:00:35.260> will<00:00:35.440> mean<00:00:35.680> a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
24 frames per second that will mean a

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.040 
24 frames per second that will mean a
shutter<00:00:36.070> speed<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.430> 48<00:00:36.910> now<00:00:37.540> the<00:00:37.600> closest

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
shutter speed of 48 now the closest

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.590 
shutter speed of 48 now the closest
setting<00:00:38.350> on<00:00:38.470> my<00:00:38.500> camera<00:00:38.650> is<00:00:39.309> 50<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:40.330> I<00:00:40.360> would

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
setting on my camera is 50 so I would

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.090 
setting on my camera is 50 so I would
use<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.930> as<00:00:41.080> my<00:00:41.199> standard<00:00:41.620> setting<00:00:41.920> for

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
use that as my standard setting for

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.579 
use that as my standard setting for
shooting<00:00:42.400> 24<00:00:42.760> frames<00:00:43.000> per<00:00:43.089> second<00:00:43.600> now<00:00:44.379> what

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
shooting 24 frames per second now what

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.530 
shooting 24 frames per second now what
does<00:00:44.769> the<00:00:44.860> shutter<00:00:45.100> speed<00:00:45.190> do<00:00:45.610> well<00:00:46.360> it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
does the shutter speed do well it

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.950 
does the shutter speed do well it
controls<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.989> visual<00:00:47.350> effect<00:00:47.769> of<00:00:47.920> motion<00:00:48.339> blur

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
controls a visual effect of motion blur

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.200 
controls a visual effect of motion blur
now<00:00:49.960> remember<00:00:50.920> when<00:00:51.280> you<00:00:51.370> use<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.730> slow<00:00:52.000> shutter

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
now remember when you use a slow shutter

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.330 
now remember when you use a slow shutter
speed<00:00:52.629> you<00:00:52.839> will<00:00:52.930> create<00:00:53.199> more<00:00:53.620> motion<00:00:54.100> blur

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
speed you will create more motion blur

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.490 
speed you will create more motion blur
and<00:00:54.610> when<00:00:55.030> use<00:00:55.210> a<00:00:55.360> fast<00:00:55.690> shutter<00:00:55.930> speed<00:00:56.320> you

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
and when use a fast shutter speed you

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.560 
and when use a fast shutter speed you
will<00:00:56.590> create<00:00:56.829> a<00:00:56.920> more<00:00:57.100> freezing<00:00:57.699> action<00:00:57.910> which

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
will create a more freezing action which

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.860 
will create a more freezing action which
can<00:00:58.750> cause<00:00:58.989> stuttering<00:00:59.670> final<00:01:00.670> remark<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.300> slow

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
can cause stuttering final remark a slow

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.630 
can cause stuttering final remark a slow
shutter<00:01:02.140> speed<00:01:02.500> makes<00:01:02.829> your<00:01:02.980> image<00:01:03.280> brighter

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
shutter speed makes your image brighter

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.120 
shutter speed makes your image brighter
than<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.059> faster<00:01:04.720> speed<00:01:04.930> because<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.979> light

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
than a faster speed because the light

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:15.020 
than a faster speed because the light
has<00:01:06.160> more<00:01:06.550> time<00:01:06.789> to<00:01:06.940> get<00:01:07.149> in<00:01:07.270> your<00:01:07.420> camera

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.160 

let's<00:01:16.030> get<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.210> real<00:01:16.420> life<00:01:16.570> sample<00:01:16.990> showing

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
let's get a real life sample showing

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.109 
let's get a real life sample showing
indifference<00:01:17.500> okay<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.490> now<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:18.880> got<00:01:19.090> a

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
indifference okay so now we got a

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.020 
indifference okay so now we got a
shutter<00:01:19.479> speed<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.810> 30<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.710> I<00:01:21.549> will<00:01:21.700> show<00:01:21.880> that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
shutter speed of 30 and I will show that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.880 
shutter speed of 30 and I will show that
it<00:01:22.240> causes<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.659> bit<00:01:22.810> more<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.259> motion<00:01:23.799> blur

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.100 

and<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:30.940> we<00:01:31.000> got<00:01:31.300> a<00:01:31.330> shutter<00:01:31.750> speed<00:01:32.080> of

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
and now we got a shutter speed of

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.140 
and now we got a shutter speed of
thousand<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:33.430> will<00:01:33.520> cause<00:01:33.760> more<00:01:33.790> a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
thousand so it will cause more a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.430 
thousand so it will cause more a
frame-by-frame

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
frame-by-frame

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.740 
frame-by-frame
action<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:39.400> you<00:01:39.580> might<00:01:39.790> not<00:01:39.940> clearly<00:01:40.330> see<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
action now you might not clearly see the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.510 
action now you might not clearly see the
differences<00:01:41.320> between<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.830> two<00:01:42.070> different

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
differences between the two different

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.370 
differences between the two different
settings<00:01:42.760> they<00:01:43.540> are<00:01:43.600> more<00:01:43.840> subtle<00:01:44.140> but<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:46.380> you

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
settings they are more subtle but if you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.990 
settings they are more subtle but if you
start<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.800> go<00:01:47.920> in<00:01:48.100> slow<00:01:48.340> motion<00:01:48.580> when<00:01:48.880> your

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
start to go in slow motion when your

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.030 
start to go in slow motion when your
footage<00:01:49.360> then<00:01:49.660> you<00:01:49.840> can<00:01:50.080> much<00:01:50.440> more<00:01:50.740> clearly

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
footage then you can much more clearly

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.890 
footage then you can much more clearly
see<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.520> differences<00:01:52.060> between<00:01:52.120> these<00:01:52.660> new

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
see the differences between these new

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.390 
see the differences between these new
settings

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.700 

and<00:02:01.300> we're<00:02:01.480> back<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.840> next<00:02:02.200> setting<00:02:02.530> that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and we're back to the next setting that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.250 
and we're back to the next setting that
I<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.890> oh<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.000> ISO<00:02:04.510> controls<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:05.080> light

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
I is oh now the ISO controls the light

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.440 
I is oh now the ISO controls the light
sensitivity<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.310> camera<00:02:06.640> sensor<00:02:07.210> a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
sensitivity of the camera sensor a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.990 
sensitivity of the camera sensor a
higher<00:02:08.200> ISO<00:02:08.470> means<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.430> becomes<00:02:09.760> more

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
higher ISO means it becomes more

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.030 
higher ISO means it becomes more
light-sensitive<00:02:10.690> therefore<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.710> will<00:02:11.830> make

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
light-sensitive therefore it will make

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.250 
light-sensitive therefore it will make
your<00:02:12.160> image<00:02:12.490> brighter<00:02:12.820> now<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.750> maximum

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
your image brighter now the maximum

amount of ISO available varies from

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.530 
amount of ISO available varies from
camera<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.080> camera<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:18.610> example<00:02:18.970> my<00:02:19.090> camera

the<00:02:20.920> maximum<00:02:21.370> amount<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:22.050> 6400<00:02:23.050> but

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the maximum amount is 6400 but

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.010 
the maximum amount is 6400 but
personally<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> always<00:02:25.150> tried<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.780> never

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
personally I always tried to never

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.860 
personally I always tried to never
exceed<00:02:26.560> an<00:02:26.740> ISO<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.490> 800<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.690> my<00:02:28.810> case

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
exceed an ISO of 800 because in my case

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.840 
exceed an ISO of 800 because in my case
everything<00:02:29.620> higher<00:02:29.800> creates<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.340> huge<00:02:30.730> amount

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
everything higher creates a huge amount

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.270 
everything higher creates a huge amount
of<00:02:31.150> digital<00:02:31.600> grain<00:02:31.870> which<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.710> most<00:02:32.830> case<00:02:33.100> is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
of digital grain which in most case is

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.190 
of digital grain which in most case is
something<00:02:33.520> we<00:02:33.820> don't<00:02:33.940> want<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:34.990> can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
something we don't want now you can

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.280 
something we don't want now you can
check<00:02:35.380> your<00:02:35.560> own<00:02:35.710> camera<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.430> see<00:02:36.640> which

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
check your own camera to see which

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.110 
check your own camera to see which
actually<00:02:38.290> has<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> nice<00:02:38.830> limit<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.610> choose<00:02:39.820> from

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
actually has a nice limit to choose from

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.780 
actually has a nice limit to choose from
not<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.690> having<00:02:40.960> an<00:02:41.410> extended<00:02:42.010> range<00:02:42.490> of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
not to having an extended range of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.440 
not to having an extended range of
digital<00:02:43.330> green<00:02:44.790> okay<00:02:45.790> let's<00:02:46.060> get<00:02:46.180> some

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
digital green okay let's get some

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.030 
digital green okay let's get some
real-life<00:02:46.690> samples<00:02:47.230> showing<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> difference

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
real-life samples showing the difference

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.240 
real-life samples showing the difference
so<00:02:48.940> now<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.120> got<00:02:49.390> my<00:02:49.600> setting<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.200> ISO<00:02:50.740> hundred

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
so now I got my setting on ISO hundred

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.270 
so now I got my setting on ISO hundred
with<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> shutter<00:02:52.570> speed<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.900> 160<00:02:53.680> an<00:02:53.890> aperture

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
with a shutter speed of 160 an aperture

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.790 
with a shutter speed of 160 an aperture
of<00:02:54.430> 6.3<00:02:55.330> now<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.410> see<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:56.710> is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
of 6.3 now you can see there is

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.290 
of 6.3 now you can see there is
absolutely<00:02:57.010> no<00:02:57.820> digital<00:02:58.060> grain<00:02:58.600> here<00:02:58.990> and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
absolutely no digital grain here and

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.180 
absolutely no digital grain here and
okay<00:03:01.300> now<00:03:01.600> we're<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:02.110> set<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
okay now we're going to set it just to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.890 
okay now we're going to set it just to
show<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.610> example<00:03:03.910> put<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.660> on<00:03:04.780> maximum<00:03:05.410> ISO

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
show the example put it on maximum ISO

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.040 
show the example put it on maximum ISO
which<00:03:07.900> is<00:03:08.580> 6400<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.330> can<00:03:10.450> see<00:03:10.750> there

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
which is 6400 and as you can see there

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.949 
which is 6400 and as you can see there
is<00:03:11.260> much<00:03:11.290> more<00:03:12.220> grain<00:03:12.730> visible<00:03:13.420> on<00:03:13.570> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
is much more grain visible on the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.540 
is much more grain visible on the
footage<00:03:15.840> okay<00:03:16.870> next<00:03:17.500> last<00:03:17.800> setting<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
footage okay next last setting the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.180 
footage okay next last setting the
aperture<00:03:19.060> now<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.810> aperture<00:03:20.440> means<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.920> size

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
aperture now the aperture means the size

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.940 
aperture now the aperture means the size
of<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.580> opening<00:03:21.730> made<00:03:22.209> by<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> diaphragm

of the opening made by a diaphragm
measured<00:03:23.950> in<00:03:24.070> f-stops<00:03:24.280> or<00:03:24.820> f-numbers<00:03:25.650> now<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
measured in f-stops or f-numbers now the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.530 
measured in f-stops or f-numbers now the
aperture<00:03:27.190> controls<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.760> depth<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.209> field

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
aperture controls the depth of field

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.080 
aperture controls the depth of field
meaning<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> range<00:03:29.770> of<00:03:30.040> distance<00:03:30.489> that<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.880> in

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
meaning the range of distance that is in

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.920 
meaning the range of distance that is in
focus<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:31.950> what<00:03:32.950> do<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.220> f-stops<00:03:33.580> mean<00:03:33.820> well<00:03:34.690> a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
focus so what do the f-stops mean well a

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.430 
focus so what do the f-stops mean well a
small<00:03:35.709> F<00:03:36.010> number<00:03:36.280> means<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:37.150> bigger<00:03:37.660> aperture

now final remark a smaller F number

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.759 
now final remark a smaller F number
makes<00:04:06.760> your<00:04:06.940> image<00:04:07.269> brighter<00:04:07.630> than<00:04:08.080> a<00:04:08.320> bigger

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
makes your image brighter than a bigger

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.470 
makes your image brighter than a bigger
F<00:04:09.010> number<00:04:09.250> also<00:04:10.150> because<00:04:10.420> more<00:04:10.690> light<00:04:10.900> enters

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
F number also because more light enters

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.720 
F number also because more light enters
camera<00:04:11.930> let's<00:04:12.739> get<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.920> realized<00:04:13.370> sample

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
camera let's get a realized sample

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.270 
camera let's get a realized sample
showing<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.209> difference<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.920> now<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.040> got

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
showing you a difference so now I got

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.400 
showing you a difference so now I got
the<00:04:16.400> aperture<00:04:16.729> set<00:04:17.000> at<00:04:17.150> 2.8<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.870> as<00:04:18.169> you<00:04:18.260> can

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
the aperture set at 2.8 and as you can

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.659 
the aperture set at 2.8 and as you can
see<00:04:18.620> their<00:04:18.859> background<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.459> blurred<00:04:20.180> out<00:04:21.669> just

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
see their background is blurred out just

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.790 
see their background is blurred out just
me<00:04:22.790> in<00:04:22.850> focus<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.479> as<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.960> probably<00:04:24.139> can<00:04:24.500> feel

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
