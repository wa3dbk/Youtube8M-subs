00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
foolproof method of diffusing your

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.560 
foolproof method of diffusing your
lights<00:04:46.930> it's<00:04:47.169> not<00:04:47.490> if<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.669> really<00:04:49.030> want<00:04:49.300> to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
lights it's not if you really want to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.790 
lights it's not if you really want to
diffuse<00:04:49.900> your<00:04:50.080> lights<00:04:50.229> just<00:04:50.500> go<00:04:50.620> out<00:04:50.740> and

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
diffuse your lights just go out and

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.480 
diffuse your lights just go out and
spend<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.250> $30.00<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.000> buy<00:04:52.479> some<00:04:52.690> diffusers

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
spend the $30.00 and buy some diffusers

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.280 
spend the $30.00 and buy some diffusers
maybe<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.580> softbox

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
maybe a softbox

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.800 
maybe a softbox
you<00:04:56.290> know<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:56.860> do-it-yourself<00:04:57.550> rig<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:58.120> to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
you know do a do-it-yourself rig to to

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.800 
you know do a do-it-yourself rig to to
get<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.169> softbox<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.280> front<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.550> your<00:05:00.669> lights

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
get a softbox in front of your lights

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.240 
get a softbox in front of your lights
there<00:05:02.169> actually<00:05:02.290> are<00:05:02.500> plenty<00:05:02.979> of<00:05:03.010> tutorials

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
there actually are plenty of tutorials

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.030 
there actually are plenty of tutorials
that<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:03.940> guys<00:05:04.180> can<00:05:04.330> use<00:05:04.419> white<00:05:04.690> nylon<00:05:05.040> and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
that you guys can use white nylon and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.090 
that you guys can use white nylon and
create<00:05:06.510> nice-looking<00:05:07.860> diffusers<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.010> can

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
create nice-looking diffusers that can

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.230 
create nice-looking diffusers that can
sit<00:05:09.370> right<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.639> front<00:05:09.760> of<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.910> lights<00:05:10.060> that

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
sit right in front of the lights that

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.860 
sit right in front of the lights that
work<00:05:10.510> really<00:05:10.870> good<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:12.130> obviously<00:05:13.000> did<00:05:13.479> this<00:05:13.630> to

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
work really good I obviously did this to

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.260 
work really good I obviously did this to
see<00:05:14.080> what<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.500> bedsheets<00:05:14.950> and<00:05:15.250> baking<00:05:15.970> paper

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
see what the bedsheets and baking paper

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.890 
see what the bedsheets and baking paper
would<00:05:17.200> look<00:05:17.380> like<00:05:17.560> on<00:05:17.770> camera<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:19.360> just

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
would look like on camera so just

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.629 
would look like on camera so just
warning<00:05:20.200> you<00:05:20.260> if<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.070> know<00:05:21.190> about<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.460> appear

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
warning you if you know about it appear

ahead<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:41.950> I<00:05:42.190> clicked<00:05:42.700> on<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.090> second<00:05:43.650> five

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
ahead and I clicked on the second five

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.430 
ahead and I clicked on the second five
hundred<00:05:44.950> watt<00:05:45.070> light<00:05:45.100> with<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:46.080> bed<00:05:47.080> sheet<00:05:47.350> in

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
hundred watt light with the bed sheet in

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.600 
hundred watt light with the bed sheet in
front<00:05:47.470> of<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.800> these<00:05:47.889> are<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.130> two<00:05:48.310> on<00:05:48.490> the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
front of and these are the two on the

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.440 
front of and these are the two on the
stands<00:05:49.000> right<00:05:49.120> here<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:49.510> it's<00:05:49.900> actually<00:05:50.229> a<00:05:50.410> 250

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
stands right here so it's actually a 250

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.490 
stands right here so it's actually a 250
combined<00:05:52.450> together<00:05:52.630> making<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.320> five

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
combined together making the five

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.060 
combined together making the five
hundred<00:05:53.889> and<00:05:54.930> moving<00:05:55.930> on<00:05:56.050> now<00:05:56.320> know<00:05:56.740> what<00:05:56.950> I'm

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
hundred and moving on now know what I'm

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.010 
hundred and moving on now know what I'm
doing<00:05:57.310> right<00:05:57.430> here<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.700> I<00:05:57.910> actually<00:05:58.120> have<00:05:58.479> the

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
doing right here is I actually have the

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.279 
doing right here is I actually have the
500<00:05:59.560> watt<00:05:59.770> not<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:00.070> two<00:06:00.190> 50s<00:06:00.639> I<00:06:01.360> have<00:06:01.750> a<00:06:01.780> 500

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
500 watt not the two 50s I have a 500

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.080 
500 watt not the two 50s I have a 500
watt<00:06:02.349> off<00:06:02.560> right<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.010> right<00:06:03.190> which<00:06:03.789> is

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
watt off right to the right which is

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.020 
watt off right to the right which is
actually<00:06:04.810> lighting<00:06:05.260> up<00:06:05.410> all<00:06:05.590> of<00:06:06.010> this<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.700> a
