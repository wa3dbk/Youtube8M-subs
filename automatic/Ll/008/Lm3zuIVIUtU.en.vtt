00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.299
 There are two main kinds of water to be 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:13.610
 purified raw water is one that 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.850
 it is extracted from natural sources as 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.870
 springs lakes rivers and napas 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.540
 underground 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.810
 the water served instead is the one 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.840
 sewer collection and discarded 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.270
 from the toilets keys toilets 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.270
 kitchens industries and others is 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.809
 the first treatment we will talk about 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.850
 is the water purification of which 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.280
 you get safe drinking water for 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.820
 human consumption from raw water 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.100
 its stages are a sieve where 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.129
 eliminate large solids 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.039
 a pre-chlorination where you add 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.630
 Sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.970
 to eliminate pathogens 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.490
 You must also add alkalinizers 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.490
 so that the pH of the water is not affected 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.350
 the posterior circulation consists of 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.260
 add aluminum sulfate and hydroxide 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.360
 of calcium to capture minor solids 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.210
 size through the reaction of 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.420
 precipitation of aluminum hydroxide and 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.850
 calcium sulfate 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.380
 the aluminum hydroxide forms some 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.850
 clots that then decant by gravity 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 catching the smallest particles 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.640
 by filtration through sand and gravel 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.070
 they retain these solids 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.890
 and after chlorination and flowering 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.620
 final the drinking water is ready to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.420
 be consumed 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.990
 the second treatment of which 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.090
 we'll talk about is the sewage 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.590
 from which irrigation water is obtained 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.590
 from sewage water 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.490
 its stages are classified according to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.689
 a primary stage or treatment 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.819
 mechanical a secondary or biological and 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.099
 a tertiary that consists in the 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.500
 additional stages such as 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.940
 demineralization of heavy metals and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.940
 the degradation of nitrates and phosphates 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 of this treatment you get a 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.180
 solid waste also called what is 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.550
 reuse as fertilizer or it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.360
 incinerator has some risks that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.940
 we will deal with later 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.280
 of the sewer the water is connected 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.410
 and pre-treated so that the plant 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.870
 of treatment comes the water without large 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.950
 solid waste like garbage that is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.810
 throw into the sewer 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.269
 then enter the treatment plant 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.340
 and they are sequentially subjected to a 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.739
 secondary and tertiary treatment if 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.239
 was required depending on the level of 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.239
 minerals and nutrients you have 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.860
 roughly the stages are 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.430
 a sieving and degreasing a 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.159
 sedimentation aeration or flotation for 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.450
 expel methane gases produced 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.410
 by the decomposition of matter 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.500
 organic 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.520
 the bacterial action consists of adding 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.710
 decomposing bacteria 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.250
 the filtration removes the products from 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.620
 decomposition and disinfection 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.260
 by chlorination and uvb rays e eliminates 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.930
 partially pathogenic agents that 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.790
 bring the water 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.799
 plants water treatment 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.989
 industrial services require large 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.359
 facilities as we observed in the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.040
 image given the huge volumes of 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:43.549
 water that should be treated to great 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.769
 scale however increasingly arise 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.480
 innovative and advanced technologies for 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.090
 that this treatment is carried out 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.450
 domestic level for example at home 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.450
 own 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.600
 on the other hand the main problem in 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.980
 the sewage treatment is how 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.540
 achieve the safety of sludge 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.269
 residual 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.549
 These are highly polluting 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.710
 eliminate them by incineration usually 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.960
 be used as fertilizer in agriculture 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.020
 The sludge treatment consists of 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.550
 reduce significantly 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.370
 microorganisms bad odors and emanation 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.460
 of polluting gases into the atmosphere 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.530
 by the decomposition gases like sulfur 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.960
 of hydrogen and methane are the biggest 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.610
 responsible is alarming the high 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.100
 content of microorganisms in 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.500
 the bacterial sludge as follows the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.680
 escherichia coli salmonella and vibrio 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.720
 cholera among many others besides 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.080
 viruses and parasites that are potentially 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.760
 pathogens there are bacteria resistant to 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.850
 antibiotics of fertilizers 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.700
 which are then ingested in food 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.740
 fertilized which constitutes one of 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.690
 the biggest problems of using sludge 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.690
 as fertilizer in agriculture 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.710
 the level of water treatment 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.370
 served in Chile has improved 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.260
 significantly in the last decade 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.910
 notwithstanding the objectives of 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.729
 treatment are still at a level 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.350
 primary environmental protection and still 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.199
 there are areas in which it is urgent to build 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.740
 new plants as shown in the 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.710
 next table 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.449
 however, and considering that an 18 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.910
 percent of the world's population does not have 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.650
 drinking water our situation is very 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.750
 fortunate 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.300
 think of the northern countries of 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.220
 Africa and South Asia that for the year 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.620
 2008 were in the range of 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.110
 extreme shortage situation that has not 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.030
 improved so far maybe they are 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.850
 necessary new technologies with the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.520
 than to get drinking water for example to 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.740
 through sea water and also at low 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.930
 cost since the pace at which the 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.979
 droughts in these regions the auguries 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.979
 they are quite dark
