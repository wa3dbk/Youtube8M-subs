00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
can see and the reason why I'm

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.210 
can see and the reason why I'm
highlighting<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.810> because<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:20.039> is

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
highlighting this is because this is

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.830 
highlighting this is because this is
kind<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> first<00:00:20.789> time<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.390> I've<00:00:21.510> owned

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
kind of the first time that I've owned

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.540 
kind of the first time that I've owned
kind<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> brand-name<00:00:23.240> solar<00:00:24.240> panel<00:00:25.550> I've

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
kind of a brand-name solar panel I've

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.220 
kind of a brand-name solar panel I've
spent<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.300> good<00:00:27.510> money<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.840> charge

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
spent some good money on charge

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.919 
spent some good money on charge
controllers<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> batteries<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.510> have

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
controllers and and batteries but I have

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.400 
controllers and and batteries but I have
yet<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> purchase<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.949> brand-name<00:00:32.989> solar<00:00:33.989> panel

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
yet to purchase a brand-name solar panel

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
yet to purchase a brand-name solar panel
so<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> kind<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.130> my<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so this is kind of my first and and the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
so this is kind of my first and and the
reason<00:00:37.170> why<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> took<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.010> plunge<00:00:38.219> was<00:00:38.760> first

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
reason why I took the plunge was first

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.440 
reason why I took the plunge was first
of<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:40.040> I<00:00:41.040> wanted<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.940> start<00:00:42.210> doing

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
of all because I wanted to start doing

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
of all because I wanted to start doing
some<00:00:42.809> videos<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> little<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
some videos with a little bit of a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.060 
some videos with a little bit of a
bigger<00:00:44.250> power<00:00:44.489> source<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.860> second<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> all

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
bigger power source and second of all

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
bigger power source and second of all
because<00:00:47.149> this<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:49.140> close<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
because this is actually really close to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.639 
because this is actually really close to
$1.00<00:00:50.250> per<00:00:50.610> watt<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> hundred<00:00:51.899> pan<00:00:52.050> 100

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
$1.00 per watt this is a hundred pan 100

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.520 
$1.00 per watt this is a hundred pan 100
watt<00:00:52.770> panel<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.090> only<00:00:54.270> 135<00:00:55.020> bucks<00:00:55.350> on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
watt panel and it was only 135 bucks on

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.340 
watt panel and it was only 135 bucks on

typically they only come with a loose

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.000 
typically they only come with a loose
spec<00:02:16.030> sheet<00:02:16.299> which<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.650> dubious<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:17.980> best

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.860 
anyway and they don't give someone who
was<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.790> ordering<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.329> for<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.690> first

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
was just ordering this for the first

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.900 
was just ordering this for the first
time<00:02:23.140> would<00:02:23.410> have<00:02:23.709> zero<00:02:24.160> clue<00:02:24.430> how<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.640> hook

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
time would have zero clue how to hook

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.789 
time would have zero clue how to hook
the<00:02:25.060> thing<00:02:25.239> up<00:02:25.420> or<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.319> with<00:02:26.470> it

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
the thing up or what to do with it

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.330 
the thing up or what to do with it
so<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.129> kind<00:02:27.579> of<00:02:27.610> like<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.000> as<00:02:28.150> well<00:02:29.190> okay<00:02:30.190> now

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
so I kind of like that as well okay now

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.020 
so I kind of like that as well okay now
flipped<00:02:30.790> over<00:02:30.970> on<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.329> back<00:02:31.660> side<00:02:31.930> you'll<00:02:32.440> see

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
flipped over on the back side you'll see

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.479 
flipped over on the back side you'll see
this<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.239> pretty<00:02:34.930> typical<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.340> want

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
this is pretty typical but I just want

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.849 
this is pretty typical but I just want
to<00:02:36.579> point<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.819> out<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.720> junction<00:02:38.319> box<00:02:38.530> or

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
to point this out this junction box or

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.740 
to point this out this junction box or
where<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.459> diodes<00:02:39.819> are<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.420> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
where the the diodes are and the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.370 
where the the diodes are and the
connections<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.519> wiring<00:02:42.700> goat<00:02:43.090> is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
connections for the wiring goat is

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.009 
connections for the wiring goat is
really<00:02:44.380> good<00:02:45.250> quality<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.970> has<00:02:46.269> clips<00:02:46.720> on<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
really good quality and has clips on the

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.569 
really good quality and has clips on the
side<00:02:47.230> where<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.470> can<00:02:47.560> actually<00:02:47.859> pop<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.250> top

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
side where you can actually pop the top

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.720 
side where you can actually pop the top
off<00:02:49.079> that's<00:02:50.079> pretty<00:02:51.069> rare<00:02:51.280> from<00:02:51.519> what<00:02:51.639> I've

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
off that's pretty rare from what I've

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.909 
off that's pretty rare from what I've
seen<00:02:51.760> as<00:02:52.090> well<00:02:52.299> I<00:02:52.720> think<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.290> other<00:02:53.410> ones<00:02:53.620> that

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
seen as well I think the other ones that

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.319 
seen as well I think the other ones that
I've<00:02:54.040> seen<00:02:54.069> come<00:02:54.280> apart<00:02:54.819> but<00:02:55.000> they're<00:02:55.180> not

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
I've seen come apart but they're not

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.360 
I've seen come apart but they're not
obvious<00:02:55.720> how<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:56.109> them<00:02:56.200> apart<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.190> that's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
obvious how to get them apart so that's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.400 
obvious how to get them apart so that's
nice<00:02:57.609> and<00:02:57.910> then<00:02:58.419> these<00:02:58.660> have<00:02:58.900> already<00:02:59.230> have

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
nice and then these have already have

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.460 
nice and then these have already have
mc4<00:03:00.040> connectors<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.700> them<00:03:00.940> which<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.389> you<00:03:02.380> know

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
mc4 connectors on them which is you know

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.110 
mc4 connectors on them which is you know
not<00:03:02.859> a<00:03:02.889> huge<00:03:03.250> deal<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.609> can<00:03:03.760> order<00:03:03.970> those

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
not a huge deal you can order those

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.940 
not a huge deal you can order those
yourself<00:03:04.569> but<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:05.139> just<00:03:05.260> an<00:03:05.440> extra<00:03:05.739> expense

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
yourself but it's just an extra expense

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.250 
yourself but it's just an extra expense
you<00:03:06.280> have<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.609> do<00:03:06.790> when<00:03:07.329> when<00:03:07.959> you're<00:03:08.079> putting

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
you have to do when when you're putting

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.990 
you have to do when when you're putting
panels<00:03:08.650> together<00:03:08.829> putting<00:03:09.549> your<00:03:09.639> system

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
panels together putting your system

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.870 
panels together putting your system
together<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.950> literally<00:03:11.950> every<00:03:12.370> other<00:03:12.459> panel

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
together and literally every other panel

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.379 
together and literally every other panel
that<00:03:13.000> I've<00:03:13.120> seen<00:03:13.359> except<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:13.989> my<00:03:14.109> diem<00:03:14.410> solar

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
that I've seen except for my diem solar

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.909 
that I've seen except for my diem solar
which<00:03:16.389> is<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.810> pretty<00:03:17.079> good<00:03:17.230> company<00:03:17.650> as<00:03:17.769> well

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
which is a pretty good company as well

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.670 
which is a pretty good company as well

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
cheap like Chinese ones that I've

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.569 
cheap like Chinese ones that I've
ordered<00:03:22.660> they<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.230> come<00:03:23.440> with<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.310> know<00:03:24.400> a

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
ordered they just come with you know a

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.890 
ordered they just come with you know a
wire<00:03:24.910> with<00:03:26.069> two<00:03:27.069> wires<00:03:27.340> with<00:03:27.669> exposed<00:03:28.359> wire<00:03:28.630> at

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
wire with two wires with exposed wire at

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.750 
wire with two wires with exposed wire at
the<00:03:29.019> end<00:03:29.169> they<00:03:29.380> don't

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
the end they don't

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.550 
the end they don't
with<00:03:29.849> connectors<00:03:30.299> on<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.480> end<00:03:30.689> so<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.470> a

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
with connectors on the end so just a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.770 
with connectors on the end so just a
nice<00:03:31.739> little<00:03:31.920> touch<00:03:32.220> there<00:03:33.650> okay<00:03:34.650> not<00:03:34.950> that

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
nice little touch there okay not that

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.789 
nice little touch there okay not that
open<00:03:36.780> circuit<00:03:37.230> measurements<00:03:38.189> are<00:03:38.599> anything

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
open circuit measurements are anything

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.740 
open circuit measurements are anything
special<00:03:40.799> or<00:03:41.099> indicative<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.150> anything<00:03:42.569> really

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
special or indicative of anything really

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.649 
special or indicative of anything really
but<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.709> hooked<00:03:43.920> up<00:03:44.040> my<00:03:44.099> multimeter<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.480> this

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
but I hooked up my multimeter to to this

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.420 
but I hooked up my multimeter to to this
and<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.010> show<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.360> working<00:03:48.810> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
and just to show that it is working and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
and just to show that it is working and
gives<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.299> voltage<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:52.349> says

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
gives you the the voltage that it says

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.140 
gives you the the voltage that it says
it's<00:03:52.739> going<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:54.950> as<00:03:55.950> for<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.519> paper<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.909> was

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
it's going to as for that paper that was

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.179 
it's going to as for that paper that was
trying<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.450> blow<00:03:57.690> away<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:58.170> just<00:03:58.409> dug<00:03:58.799> this<00:03:58.980> out

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
trying to blow away I just dug this out

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.039 
trying to blow away I just dug this out
just<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.549> show<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.819> this<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.209> an<00:04:00.329> example<00:04:00.659> of

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
just to show you this is an example of

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.300 
just to show you this is an example of
literally<00:04:01.859> all<00:04:02.069> that<00:04:02.099> was<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:03.890> cheapo<00:04:04.890> panel

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
literally all that was in a cheapo panel

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460 
literally all that was in a cheapo panel
that<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.519> ordered<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.780> graph<00:04:07.109> that<00:04:07.140> shows

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that I ordered it's a graph that shows

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.789 
that I ordered it's a graph that shows
you<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.010> performance<00:04:08.609> of<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> module<00:04:09.569> and

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
you the performance of the module and

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.410 
you the performance of the module and
some<00:04:10.799> specs<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.370> comes<00:04:11.760> literally<00:04:12.269> with

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
some specs it comes literally with

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.539 
some specs it comes literally with
nothing<00:04:12.780> else<00:04:12.900> nothing<00:04:13.739> on<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.950> back<00:04:14.099> just

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
nothing else nothing on the back just

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.180 
nothing else nothing on the back just
that<00:04:15.480> was<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.629> it<00:04:15.959> was<00:04:16.049> taped<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.769> module

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
that was it it was taped to the module

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.800 
that was it it was taped to the module
and<00:04:17.340> good<00:04:18.329> luck

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and good luck

and good luck
so<00:04:19.350> anyway<00:04:20.030> I'm<00:04:21.030> really<00:04:21.209> happy<00:04:21.479> with<00:04:21.690> this

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
so anyway I'm really happy with this

so anyway I'm really happy with this
thing<00:04:22.199> it's<00:04:22.530> really<00:04:23.160> good<00:04:23.460> quality<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
thing it's really good quality the the

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.110 
thing it's really good quality the the
has<00:04:26.580> got<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.789> serial<00:04:27.360> number<00:04:27.660> on<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.910> for<00:04:29.910> the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
has got a serial number on the for the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.010 
has got a serial number on the for the
module<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.550> I'm<00:04:32.639> sure<00:04:32.699> if<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.690> have<00:04:33.840> any

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
module there so I'm sure if you have any

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.659 
module there so I'm sure if you have any
warranty<00:04:34.349> issues<00:04:34.740> it's<00:04:35.039> going<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.250> be<00:04:35.310> easy<00:04:35.460> to

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
warranty issues it's going to be easy to

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.469 
warranty issues it's going to be easy to
identify<00:04:35.820> that<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.760> concludes<00:04:39.000> the

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
identify that so that concludes the

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.290 
identify that so that concludes the
review<00:04:39.949> if<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.400> want<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.760> see<00:04:41.910> what<00:04:42.120> this

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
review if you want to see what this

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.760 
review if you want to see what this
thing<00:04:42.479> can<00:04:42.630> actually<00:04:42.690> do<00:04:43.199> I'm<00:04:43.349> going<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.530> start

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
thing can actually do I'm going to start

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.210 
thing can actually do I'm going to start
a<00:04:43.860> series<00:04:44.220> called<00:04:45.000> will<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.510> solar<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.260> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
a series called will it solar and the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.100 
a series called will it solar and the
reason<00:04:47.849> I<00:04:47.880> got<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.210> name<00:04:48.449> my<00:04:48.660> son's<00:04:48.930> really

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
reason I got that name my son's really

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.890 
reason I got that name my son's really
into<00:04:49.590> good<00:04:49.979> mythical<00:04:50.190> morning<00:04:50.750> channel<00:04:51.750> on

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
into good mythical morning channel on

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.490 
into good mythical morning channel on
YouTube<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.530> so<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:54.210> thought<00:04:54.389> I'd<00:04:54.570> kind

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
YouTube and so I just thought I'd kind

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.029 
YouTube and so I just thought I'd kind
of<00:04:55.680> play<00:04:56.130> off<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:57.260> call<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.470> next

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
of play off of that and call this next

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.770 
of play off of that and call this next
little<00:04:59.370> series<00:04:59.669> will<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.210> solar<00:05:00.479> and<00:05:00.720> I'm

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
little series will it solar and I'm

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.540 
little series will it solar and I'm
going<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:00.960> use<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.260> panel<00:05:01.710> because<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.400> is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
going to use this panel because this is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.260 
going to use this panel because this is
this<00:05:03.060> is<00:05:03.270> an<00:05:03.389> actual<00:05:03.690> usable<00:05:04.289> size<00:05:04.620> panel

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
this is an actual usable size panel

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.430 
this is an actual usable size panel
where<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.510> actually<00:05:06.660> start<00:05:06.990> powering

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
where you can actually start powering

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.430 
where you can actually start powering
meaningful<00:05:08.039> devices<00:05:08.550> with<00:05:08.729> it<00:05:08.940> 10<00:05:09.840> watt<00:05:10.020> 20

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
meaningful devices with it 10 watt 20

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.480 
meaningful devices with it 10 watt 20
watt<00:05:10.560> panels<00:05:10.979> you're<00:05:11.099> not<00:05:11.190> going<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.370> be<00:05:11.430> able

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
watt panels you're not going to be able

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.909 
watt panels you're not going to be able
to<00:05:11.610> do<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.789> whole<00:05:11.849> lot<00:05:12.120> with<00:05:12.270> but<00:05:13.020> this<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.889> can

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
to do a whole lot with but this you can

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.640 
to do a whole lot with but this you can
actually<00:05:14.340> power<00:05:14.520> something<00:05:15.210> usable<00:05:15.599> and<00:05:15.900> so

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
actually power something usable and so

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.100 
actually power something usable and so
I'm<00:05:16.800> going<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.099> be<00:05:17.340> using<00:05:17.550> this<00:05:17.880> panel<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.510> a

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
I'm going to be using this panel and a

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.649 
I'm going to be using this panel and a
cheap<00:05:19.530> charge<00:05:19.889> controller<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.880> an<00:05:21.360> inverter

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
cheap charge controller and an inverter

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.370 
cheap charge controller and an inverter
to<00:05:22.050> show<00:05:23.389> what<00:05:24.389> you<00:05:24.539> can<00:05:24.750> actually<00:05:24.930> do<00:05:25.349> with

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
to show what you can actually do with

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.409 
to show what you can actually do with
this<00:05:25.710> particular<00:05:26.070> panel<00:05:26.520> with<00:05:26.909> this<00:05:27.060> kind<00:05:27.360> of

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
this particular panel with this kind of

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.510 
this particular panel with this kind of
a<00:05:27.479> size<00:05:27.720> of<00:05:27.990> panel<00:05:28.380> should<00:05:29.070> be<00:05:29.159> an<00:05:29.250> interesting

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
a size of panel should be an interesting

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.879 
a size of panel should be an interesting
series<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.449> stay<00:05:30.780> tuned<00:05:30.990> for<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.260> thanks<00:05:31.770> for
