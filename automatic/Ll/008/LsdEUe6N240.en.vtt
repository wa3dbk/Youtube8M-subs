in the series
I'm<00:04:25.289> not<00:04:25.740> gluten<00:04:26.669> saying<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.120> terrible<00:04:27.690> I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
graphically I think that really all the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.140 
graphically I think that really all the
things<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.300> did<00:04:36.509> right<00:04:36.810> were<00:04:37.050> overshadowed<00:04:37.380> by

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
the things that just really in the way

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.149 
the things that just really in the way

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
us like the commentary that was just

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.129 
us like the commentary that was just
unbelievably<00:04:44.159> annoying<00:04:44.849> as<00:04:45.300> in<00:04:45.570> Michael<00:04:45.780> Cole

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139
