 where god will be able to make you a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 powerful instrument in his hands if you 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.390
 begin to practice speaking in 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.970
 the apostle Paul was saying in the same 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.390

 book today that people read 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.190

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.270
 there is no one who has spoken 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.880
 as much as paul to speak in tongues 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.110
 it gives you the full measure of 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.350
 ministry of fault rests round

 specific amine to so powerful how 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.080
 these revelations he received from god the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.570
 plan of salvation their redemption of humanity 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.120
 which made us discover through the 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.360
 letters the teams and well we 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.900
 understand I understood this the talk 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.810
 in it was a powerful engine for 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.959
 help him in his revelations year 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.940
 seize rnd give alleluia I 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.740
 plains the most 10 inches in the same 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.900
 chapter 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.300
 9:46 we see in this shock that is 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.970
 nor a little bit to Paris reserves in 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.750
 public accounting standards in 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.220
 meetings seemed slow he was 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.310
 obvious people would not understand 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.290
 we also need to read the word of 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.200
 taught to praise God by singing them 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.580
 intelligible fields so he says of course 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.320
 at that time people were praying 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.950
 so much talk so long and 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.239
 the computer when we are together we 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.020
 can also have a lot of things 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.760
 intelligible to tell oneself 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.460
 but still we see that Paul 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.440
 ti brilliant language is extremely 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.470
 mighty he says that when we pray 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.720
 language our intelligence and sterile 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.790
 but our spirit is praying in the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.260
 same tax chapter 21 14 that means 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.310
 what 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.170
 our intelligence of our being in 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.350
 slope she does not like our intelligence 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.940
 not even is out of control she 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.140
 wants to control everything we have 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.850
 grown up is taught since little 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.450
 the cult of reason reason 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.800
 so important it's so much the 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.370
 center of everything we do not understand 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.440
 not we struggle on wary do not 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.810
 you worry what your intelligence and at 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.130
 control of your life and sometimes you can 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.870
 please release 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.600
 I have something else to do I trust 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.100
 in god god said that whoever speaks 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.230
 hanks is hard human i'm going 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.570
 take an hour I will reload the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.820
 batteries from the east but fortified from 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.790
 inside of them recharge the batteries 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.850
 In the name of Jesus Hallelujah 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.830
 I started to practice speaking 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.660
 in languages ​​every day and paul was saying 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.970
 that I speak more than all of you I 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.270
 could imagine this man it's sums 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.680
 spoken in the morning at noon the night he 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.750
 was in the shower he talk in 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.250
 languages ​​that is getting ready and his little 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.810
 lunch they speak their language if they 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.350
 were of our day he would have rolled 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.310
 by car and he would have spoken in language 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.630
 because there you need your 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.220
 intelligence for 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 the frozen road you can leave
