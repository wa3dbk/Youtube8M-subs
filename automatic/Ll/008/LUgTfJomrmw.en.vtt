 length effectively cutting edge total 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.090

 i.e. it is a good daytime cutter with it 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.390
 so concave descents thin seats 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.140

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.800
 complaints about the peg that was here 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.210
