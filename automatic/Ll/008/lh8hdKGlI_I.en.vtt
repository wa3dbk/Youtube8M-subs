 less bagnall art and cédric and that's 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.590
 interesting to have his opinion precisely 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:26.540
 on the car e 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:30.740

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.700

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.300
 as a car that it can cost a 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.040
 arm probably what they do best 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.040
 to do like mercedes or an hour 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.649

 am riding in a class s mercedes 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.380
 ayem to your career understood it the little 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.990
 cushion on the support of the lodges 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:16.450

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.590
 tell me if you feel so good I love 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.119
 the guy who tells me they do not like 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 the cars is good Corsican is this 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.090
 who tells me he does that but it's at 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.990
 benchmark for seventy years but 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.700
 I said I do not put the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.319
 cars already refused to put as much 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.509
 money in a car is different 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.470
 I thing there you need are there you yourself 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:41.709
 you are an 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:44.709
 What is it lé rugby this course it 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:47.259
 could be the football that would be done I 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.729
 am myself I have until what's the point 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.409
 said it's not a class is 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.979
 spontaneously having led him first 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:02:06.640
 clean up right now you tell me if all 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:08.310
 that's still a little spotty all 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.299
 it's 70 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.560
 you know that no, but you have to 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.170
 passes that remakes flagship this is 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.040
 some 25 c that's no, but you do not know 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.660
 what I was waiting for you to ask me 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.819
 issue you not ask me pissed 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.769
 and why do they do that what they know 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.450
 in France tends to 2 g that of the boss 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.480
 will never see it is seen a little to 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.819
 states it's the CEO's 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.590
 of hyundai certainly a little bit you 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.780
 will see very little but it's a way 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.950
 for them to say we are present when 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.130
 even on its members these fights 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.480
 hanging but we take milestones mark 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.130
 sizes is like football 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.799
 see you have to go to the championship 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.620
 will never win the same for example 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.829
 over ten years because 80 75 years ago there is a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.940
 stuff where i can to huy to the usb3 truck there 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.290
 if one day we want to be in league 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.310
 champions or play the world cup 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.329
 first of all, you have to go through the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.720
 stuff that is not the evening at the 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.970
 Nantes 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.829
 What is Nantes waiting for? 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.880
 the inventory so it's been 40 years since 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.360
 nantes 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.580
 cumulated the champion if I could 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.900
 exceed 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.540
 yeah I do not know this alkaline daime 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.280
 everything to his good he brags about in their 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.860
 country they sell a little bit you see 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 it's all a messenger it's a way 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.790
 to say it's weird in the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.370
 world is because you have it too 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.510
 probably why that's because 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.840
 it is a false contact but if there is any 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.730
 light 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:34.150
 yes no but there is no turn to I am 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.660
 round and material tours 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.580
 noble 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.080
 I prefer to be next to you a little more 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.920
 speed me too but now they 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.140
 do not stop saying must say long 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.940
 fashionable ways he puts it all this 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.580
 Wood is wood as if it had 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.850
 summer coal 'ise what I liked your 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.830
 report on the Peugeot that you 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.440
 will have it in the center peugeot le 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.110
 concept because yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.910
 all right to the water so that 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.830
 actually I do not know if we're going to 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:09.790
 see that that's all far from perfect 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.740
 but the shadow of genesis the rites the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.200
 nude lights that's not me it's 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.030
 you who saw it kama because you see in 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.410
 talk about helping you believe you see there is 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.880
 a too clinical light 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.530
 people will tell me but why do you 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.730
 say it's not good roubaudi you're 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.070
 at home you already want them 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.840
 teeth in a dental office are you 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.200
 tell me about the expectations 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.200
 that's it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.770
 yeah we did without bound yesterday and that's 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.350
 not bad but by lots of little details 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.710
 they are not there we believe we believe in 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.540
 seeing the armchairs believe for example 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.460
 the light is too stung and at night 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.740
 they wanted to light up all the time 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:11.460
 the bazaar but that's not good that it 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:20.050
 would need a second-best non lapize 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:21.490
 a little bit of a little bit more if she 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.180
 wants to do like the mercedes taxis they 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.250
 have this light 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.720
 after there's a guy who will tell you the six 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.130
 Games robots can be hot self 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.410
 armchair I not so bad that I played 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.860
 bad to locate very hot a little bit 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.350
 hot especially too because do we have to 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.750
 carpet on it you feel stuff in C 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:46.620
 who rolls week to inflate but what but 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.850
 it does that but you do not know what that 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.920
 feel the damn lumbar adjustment we have 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:55.840
 is 100 km and we have already eaten a quarter 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.900
 parents of the good recoil fat of 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.050
 full night anyway is clear no he 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.730
 is that yes it is butter devious 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.430
 would take time but I too 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.630
 always afraid of me no it's not bad 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.630
 you see what you 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.960
 so with this kind of oxcart 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.960
 ground 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.020
 there's everything but the account is not there 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:26.880
 as they say a guard and look at me 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.490
 it's not beautiful 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.050
 the autumn go ahead fool me lessons 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.580
 because in fact it's rolling in 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.810
 these beautiful scenery with music 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.120
 that makes me want to film I do not know 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.710
 not what I would do but that's what 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.039
 is nice by the way, come on come that's it 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.039
 rolling 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.460
 and 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.529
 and 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.150
 that's it's you cars up 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:01.210
 classical music beautiful road 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.379
 it's totally lost one of his 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.379
 relay in the square candor
