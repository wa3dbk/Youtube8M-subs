00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.619
 since welcome the video here what I you 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.740
 Present today I'll show you once 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 briefly what you in the next update in the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 version 2.6 of the adac expected 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.790
 in addition to the commercial bugfixing and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.989
 small texture and beauty repairs 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.030
 Of course some new ones too 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.640
 I'll give you some features here 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.820
 we want to show in advance we catch 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.329
 now again and what does that bring 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.079
 as the first new feature of the game that 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 Gas turbine power plant who is angry 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.250
 not about fallow bees dollars 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 or 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.110
 like in underwater this one can now 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 use by the new 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.509
 Gas turbine power plant builds on this 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.509
 brings a total of 90 energy at one 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:15.960
 at that time with a balance of videos 100 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.520
 and so you can beautiful this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 harness energy sources for you 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 another highlight is the new one 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.479
 deep sea research complex building there 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.400
 you can now explore new items 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.689
 which then islandwide do not apply 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.990
 We continued, for example 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.060
 once - 15 percent on food - 15 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 percent on drinks or - 15 11 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.409
 lifestyle or just minus five percent 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200
 on all three types 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.819
 the farther can but here the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.219
 Living room either +8 for the increase 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.109
 respective faction or +4 for all three 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.100
 fractions 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.909
 the same applies to the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
 tax revenues that more for 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.630
 maintenance costs for the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.229
 energy consumption or just for the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.359
 Life Cycle Assessment around this per Fraction or But 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.979
 just for all three fractions each order 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.979
 to lower a certain factor 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.560
 Another feature was the eco-balance 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.060
 Revised this work speaks 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.670
 linear from the values ​​of minus 99 999 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.190
 Normally they had a production 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.430
 of 175 percent here are more now 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.160
 because the above +12 because you are noble 4 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.160
 600 + 10 from the senate effect so 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.390
 regulated months 70 percent at 5 100 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.790
 if you now the accordingly 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.150
 Life Cycle Assessment increases what with just once 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.150
 right here 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.300
 make screws 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.760
 you can see how linear the colors are 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.060
 corresponding increase in the productivity 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.630
 of course , the life cycle assessment falls 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.130
 accordingly in the minus range 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.860
 of course, accordingly 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.690
 worse crops on the plantations then 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.740
 also for who like their settlement 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.320
 further beautify 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.480
 Again, there is something new 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.410
 palette pulsating lighting these 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.170
 you will find the menu fee 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.849
 give praise and lighting and masts 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.190
 and here as a special feature like me 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.480
 already said some changes 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.410
 These masks you can either under 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.360
 water on the quay wall of vacation tree 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.810
 and depending on where you are 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.430
 changes over the old 1 next to or 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.800
 under water 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.300
 according to a number also for 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.350
 people a bit more in with theirs 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.489
 Settlement play respectively 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.239
 beautify 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.870
 in the menu acc acc your building there under 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.760
 Street employee 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.560
 There you can do a whole lot of factory workers 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.350
 Range of workers also set that 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.840
 switch back to c as usual 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.500
 can and live a little bit more 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.420
 brings in the bude we come now to the 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.269
 part for our military strategist here 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.160
 the new jackets offered virginia that 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.739
 especially against hostile and used 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.269
 can be 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.700
 but that is the only unit that 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.690
 the new law 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:25.270
 next to the janko offered only by law 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.310
 the new tenerife helios to that 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.730
 was designed around enemy buildings 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.730
 attack 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:38.290
 then also a new one 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.389
 aircraft carrier of up to eight aircraft 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.290
 can accommodate you to transport 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.669
 can repair or refuel 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.660
 depending of course logically from 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.660
 the size plane 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.090
 such such a small gaggle 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.889
 threaten by John Deere as normal the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.219
 carriers and more return 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.219
 command then land this 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.800
 according to the carrier 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.330
 the same again from other carriers 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.420
 with one 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.560
 unit hawks 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.880
 just like that 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.139
 stationed on it and then at 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.139
 corresponding return command 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.729
 this carrier drives and lands 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.560
 of course the cats there too 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.900
 has set up final touch boot one 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.660
 particularity of this masking 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.660
 world in which it then surrounding units 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:05.820
 on the whole, as a prospect 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.249
 on the new the new update 2 and 0 6 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.969
 I hope 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:15.079
 there is something for everyone 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.079
 parents only once again beautiful
