go<00:01:46.170> into<00:01:46.410> system<00:01:47.010> then<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.090> control<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
go into system then go to control and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100 
go into system then go to control and
over<00:01:50.100> down<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.370> you'll<00:01:51.060> see<00:01:51.150> wait<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.930> kill

are<00:02:11.970> using<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
are using up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.820 
are using up
and<00:02:14.030> there's<00:02:14.630> also<00:02:14.780> another<00:02:15.200> thing<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.800> you

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and there's also another thing that you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.980 
and there's also another thing that you
can<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.460> can<00:02:16.490> actually<00:02:17.030> change<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.720> so

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
can do you can actually change it so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.690 
can do you can actually change it so
that<00:02:18.370> your<00:02:19.370> computer<00:02:19.630> actually<00:02:20.630> um<00:02:21.310> turns<00:02:22.310> on

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that your computer actually um turns on

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.780 
that your computer actually um turns on
faster<00:02:23.540> okay<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:23.990> what<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.590> want<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.070> is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
faster okay so what you want to do is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.140 
faster okay so what you want to do is
you've<00:02:26.060> got<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:27.290> you've<00:02:27.710> got<00:02:27.740> H<00:02:28.520> key<00:02:28.850> under

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
you've got so you've got H key under

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
you've got so you've got H key under

that system control

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.410 
that system control
I'm<00:02:35.810> going<00:02:35.960> to<00:02:36.050> go<00:02:36.110> down<00:02:36.440> until<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.160> says

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
I'm going to go down until it says

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.750 
I'm going to go down until it says
contact<00:02:38.560> contents<00:02:39.560> index<00:02:39.770> where<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.580> has<00:02:40.730> a

contact contents index where it has a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.030 
contact contents index where it has a
little<00:02:40.940> plus<00:02:41.300> sign<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.590> that's<00:02:42.740> going<00:02:42.980> to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
little plus sign on so that's going to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.550 
little plus sign on so that's going to
show<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.340> all<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.760> different<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.360> tours<00:02:45.350> you

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
show you all the different on tours you

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.440 
show you all the different on tours you
can<00:02:45.710> edit<00:02:45.860> all<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.280> registry<00:02:46.760> sings<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.360> you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
can edit all the registry sings so you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.500 
can edit all the registry sings so you
want<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.690> go<00:02:47.780> down<00:02:48.050> right<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.920> bottom<00:02:49.510> so

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
want to go down right to the bottom so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.330 
want to go down right to the bottom so
once<00:02:50.930> you're<00:02:51.050> at<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.170> bottom<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.890> want<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.190> go

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
once you're at the bottom you want to go

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.270 
once you're at the bottom you want to go
over<00:02:52.550> here<00:02:52.730> versus<00:02:53.180> startup<00:02:53.840> delay<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:55.100> that's

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
over here versus startup delay so that's

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.940 
over here versus startup delay so that's
start<00:02:56.000> delay<00:02:56.450> with<00:02:56.630> no<00:02:56.840> spaces<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.650> double

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
start delay with no spaces so double

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.810 
start delay with no spaces so double
click<00:02:58.010> on<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.780> I'm<00:02:59.780> in<00:03:00.490> decimal<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.640> used

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
click on this and I'm in decimal it used

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.730 
click on this and I'm in decimal it used
to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:03.220> 480,000<00:03:04.220> I've<00:03:04.700> changed<00:03:05.240> mine<00:03:05.600> to

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
to be 480,000 I've changed mine to

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.190 
to be 480,000 I've changed mine to
40,000<00:03:06.740> um<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.360> make<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.660> law<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.080> can

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
40,000 um you can make it law you can

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.630 
40,000 um you can make it law you can
make<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.410> high<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.830> doesn't<00:03:10.220> really<00:03:10.340> matter

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
make a high it doesn't really matter

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.940 
make a high it doesn't really matter
just<00:03:11.150> it'll<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.780> depend<00:03:12.110> on<00:03:12.350> how<00:03:12.530> long<00:03:12.709> it'll

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
just it'll just depend on how long it'll

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.430 
just it'll just depend on how long it'll
take<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.400> computer<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:13.970> load<00:03:14.120> up<00:03:14.330> so<00:03:15.320> that's

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
take your computer to load up so that's

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.260 
take your computer to load up so that's
not<00:03:15.739> a<00:03:15.800> cool<00:03:16.190> little<00:03:16.430> trick<00:03:16.670> that<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.910> can<00:03:17.000> do

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
not a cool little trick that you can do

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.290 
not a cool little trick that you can do

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
can do for nerds XP but you can get into

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.350 
can do for nerds XP but you can get into
this<00:03:29.720> as<00:03:29.930> well<00:03:29.959> if<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:30.920> go<00:03:31.100> into<00:03:31.489> run<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.270> you

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
this as well if you go into run and you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.090 
this as well if you go into run and you

got MSC so it's GP ed IT dots m/s see so

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.950 
got MSC so it's GP ed IT dots m/s see so
you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.070> type<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.280> in<00:03:44.490> on<00:03:44.850> run<00:03:45.210> you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
you want to type that in on run you

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.830 
you want to type that in on run you
wanna<00:03:46.140> click<00:03:46.350> OK<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.880> will<00:03:48.090> bring<00:03:48.420> up<00:03:48.600> once

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
wanna click OK this will bring up once

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.860 
wanna click OK this will bring up once
it's<00:03:49.020> loaded<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:50.520> group<00:03:50.760> policy<00:03:51.150> so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
it's loaded the group policy so

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.960 
it's loaded the group policy so
basically<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:52.680> will<00:03:52.860> change<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.520> local

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
basically this will change the local

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.930 
basically this will change the local
computer<00:03:54.210> policy<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.400> years<00:03:56.700> of

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
computer policy and the years of

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.550 
computer policy and the years of
configuration<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.990> will<00:03:58.080> not<00:03:58.110> only<00:03:58.380> change

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
configuration so it will not only change

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.950 
configuration so it will not only change
the<00:03:59.010> whole<00:03:59.190> computers<00:03:59.790> but<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:00.870> also

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
the whole computers but it can also

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.730 
the whole computers but it can also
change<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:02.130> your<00:04:02.640> one<00:04:02.850> user

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
change just your one user

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.290 
change just your one user
you<00:04:04.800> can<00:04:04.980> see<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.580> few<00:04:05.850> different<00:04:06.240> things

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
you can see it's a few different things

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.720 
you can see it's a few different things
you<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.930> change<00:04:07.260> here<00:04:07.520> software<00:04:08.520> settings

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
you can change here software settings

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.230 
you can change here software settings
basically<00:04:09.540> allows<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:10.050> to

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
basically allows you to

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.930 
basically allows you to
change<00:04:11.630> any<00:04:12.080> software<00:04:12.590> or<00:04:12.980> Windows<00:04:13.640> settings

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
change any software or Windows settings

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.949 
change any software or Windows settings
those<00:04:14.870> move<00:04:15.140> on

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.249 

so<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:20.739> can<00:04:21.039> change<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.789> scripts<00:04:22.449> below<00:04:23.050> i'm

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
so you can change the scripts below i'm

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.010 
so you can change the scripts below i'm
not<00:04:23.759> so<00:04:24.759> that's<00:04:25.000> pretty<00:04:25.210> good<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.870> can
