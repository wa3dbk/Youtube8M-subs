00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.290
 the history of cables morph message 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.869
 null goes back to the beginning of the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 post-war the script is appreciated from a 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.699
 black and white movie but the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.500
 music is not played by a symphony orchestra 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.500
 but a 52 horsepower engine 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 today in a word variance 1500 of 1951 a 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 luxury car the steering wheel and the beautiful 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540
 Instrument panel with gold-plated 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.199
 all sides already allow to include the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.199
 'economic miracle' 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.660
 the buffet is indeed a miracle of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.540
 postwar period 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.570
 when the 1500 hansa is presented in 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.570
 March 1949 in Geneva 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.629
 German competitors mute opel 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.180
 Ford and Mercedes still produce the models 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.960
 of the 30s and also the engine of 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 hansa is better the four cylinder has 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.890
 a power of 52 horses the Mercedes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.890
 170 see for example with 10% more than 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.409
 displacement only 45 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.560
 the official maximum speed of this 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.420
 car are 120 kilometers per hour but 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.690
 to reach them you need a lot 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.240
 time and courage because it shakes for 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.630
 everywhere I went 80 and it's enough 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.550
 reaches completely 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.220
 on the other hand the poor stability 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.520
 directional oscillating rear axle 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.299
 gives the hansa a surprising comfort 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.710
 marching 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.450
 very interesting is the vision towards 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 forward it looks like the back of a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 whale seems to be a huge car but 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.159
 they do not help it, it's the fan of hansa 1500 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.899
 there are several family sedan versions 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.689
 van and cabriolet four seats 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.100
 like this model of the automobile museum 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:13.600
 of volkswagen with jet body milan 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.290
 it quickly becomes clear what the point is 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.540
 weak of this car the gearbox the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.840
 lever at the wheel is very modern in the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.660
 years of 50 makes the marches are not 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.200
 directly put gears but to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.870
 through rods what produces 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 pulls and struggles but when you walk 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.790
 In three years, 23,000 were manufactured 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.800
 hansa 1500 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.400
 when the gortat jan sabil 500 was 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.340
 presented in 1949 was one of the cars 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.590
 most advanced of his time was the first 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.920
 German car with a pontoon body 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.560
 American type although simple without 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.560
 many tested ribs or sheets 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.910
 also the technique was very modern 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:08.900
 intermittent independent suspension 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.030
 electricity and since 1950 with the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.190
 first automatic gearbox will 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.350
 market 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.960
 in comparison the fox back net mÃ¼ller is 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.000
 sees more youthful cool almost eccentric to 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.280
 Although its forms are much more 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.550
 old center is like the way 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.920
 bendetti fillets in with bodies get 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.560
 I was transformed by the beetle into a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.350
 ideal of postwar beauty the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 flirty part rounded back the hood 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.110
 audible and bicolor paint transform 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.230
 the force baguette hefner in a car 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.280
 luxury although the engine is modest a boxer 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.280
 of 25 horses 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.610
 It goes better with me than him because of pact 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.450
 only two German cars go on the market 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.450
 in 1949 the vaart drum record and the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.000
 elegant fox baguette mule cabriolet 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.209
 compared to the board part the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.209
 Drinking ska work is more dynamic 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.269
 in sporty and beautiful 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.519
 the cellular big demand was received the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.519
 order to manufacture 2000 units 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.510
 but only 696 were built because the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.110
 factory caught fire in 1949 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.930
 during that tragic event 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.150
 ride in the car a coveted object of 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.000
 collectors and it costs the same with your 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.570
 radio only 100 units have survived 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.570
 until today 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.340
 with the board the directional stability 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.710
 it is also in the beetle all a 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.479
 challenge due to the narrow tires 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.909
 and the oscillating axle behind you have to 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.909
 Concentrate a lot so as not to deviate 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.050
 on the road the best thing is not to demand 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:01.939
 too much to the boxer engine four 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.939
 11- liter cylinders 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.970
 from 0 to 100 in 50 seconds a sports 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.879
 it looks different maximum speed 105 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.620
 kilometers per hour but what map with 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:19.599
 this wind of march you have the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:22.270
 feeling of going fast 7500 frames 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:25.930
 It cost the Volkswagen cabriolet three 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:29.409
 times more than the normal 11 thousand 400 the 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.750
 hansa if I had to decide for one 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:34.780
 of the two I think I would take the 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.750
 Volkswagen drives more easily and 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.930
 it is very beautiful, of course, everything is more 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:46.389
 spartan but the andres statement goes 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:51.180
 with me statement both trucks of 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.180
 Piura are still dream cars
