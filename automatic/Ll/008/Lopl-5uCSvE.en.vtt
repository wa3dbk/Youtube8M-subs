eighty-seven<00:00:07.779> view<00:00:07.960> at<00:00:08.080> Riga<00:00:09.480> we're<00:00:10.480> gonna

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:10.629 
eighty-seven view at Riga we're gonna

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:13.580 
eighty-seven view at Riga we're gonna
gotta<00:00:10.809> turn<00:00:11.110> around

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
hundred all of them pulley system over

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.720 
hundred all of them pulley system over
here<00:00:44.620> on<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.949> front<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:47.700> accommodate<00:00:48.700> our
