00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
top and we're going to make this come

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.450 
top and we're going to make this come
down<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.949> more<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.219> needs

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
down a bit more like that and that needs

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.390 
down a bit more like that and that needs
to<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.260> coming<00:01:04.710> similar

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to have a so that is then coming similar

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.590 
to have a so that is then coming similar
angle<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.960> should<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.320> coming<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.710> there

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
angle that should be coming down there

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
angle that should be coming down there
this<00:01:09.600> has<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> thickness<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.100> because

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this has got a thickness to it because

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.020 
this has got a thickness to it because
the<00:01:11.520> fetch<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.799> straw<00:01:13.799> roof<00:01:14.729> kind

the fetch is a kind of straw roof kind

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
the fetch is a kind of straw roof kind
of<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.470> that's<00:01:16.470> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.799> come<00:01:16.979> around<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of thing that's going to come around the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
of thing that's going to come around the
top<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> be

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
top like that and that's going to be

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.850 
top like that and that's going to be
rounded<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> top<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
rounded on the top there so we kind of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820 
rounded on the top there so we kind of
rounded<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> edges<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.680> we're

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
rounded on the edges and then we're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
rounded on the edges and then we're
going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:27.090> door<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:28.140> going

pattern<00:01:50.970> around<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> thatch<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
pattern around there of the thatch and

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.410 
pattern around there of the thatch and
that<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:56.119> read<00:01:57.119> something

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that will then also I read something

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.609 
that will then also I read something
like<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> put<00:01:58.500> these

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
like that and I'm going to put these

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.399 
like that and I'm going to put these
little<00:01:58.890> X's<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.670> here<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.750> something

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
little X's in here which is something

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
little X's in here which is something
they're<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> things<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.340> hold<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.790> all

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
they're kind of things that hold it all

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.350 
they're kind of things that hold it all
down<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> bring<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.969> kind

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
of down here and it's going to be kind

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.160 
of down here and it's going to be kind
of<00:02:08.429> patchy<00:02:09.890> along<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> bottom

of patchy along the bottom
that<00:02:13.010> will<00:02:13.370> be<00:02:13.520> rounded<00:02:13.910> off<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.210> well<00:02:14.420> a

little bit there roundish that's kind of
the<00:02:17.600> thickness<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:20.030> action<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.050> will

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230

there like that I have a bit of shadow
down<00:03:55.910> there<00:03:56.269> maybe<00:03:56.950> put<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:57.980> shadow<00:03:58.310> on<00:03:58.579> that

down there maybe put a shadow on that

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.310 
down there maybe put a shadow on that
side<00:03:59.090> I'm<00:03:59.360> putting<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.840> shadow<00:04:00.079> on<00:04:00.230> a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
side I'm putting the shadow on a

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.930 
side I'm putting the shadow on a
different<00:04:00.620> side<00:04:00.860> than<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.130> normally<00:04:01.190> do<00:04:01.700> so

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
different side than I normally do so

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.280 
different side than I normally do so
that<00:04:02.150> would<00:04:02.299> be<00:04:02.480> slightly<00:04:02.959> shaded<00:04:03.380> there<00:04:05.290> you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
that would be slightly shaded there you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.060 
that would be slightly shaded there you
will<00:04:06.470> see<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:08.560> thatch<00:04:09.560> on<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.190> side

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
will see that the thatch on this side

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.270 
will see that the thatch on this side
the<00:04:13.070> thickness<00:04:13.579> of<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.970> kind<00:04:14.810> of<00:04:14.870> straw<00:04:15.280> straw

we'll probably be there but that would

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.750 
we'll probably be there but that would
be<00:04:21.840> much<00:04:22.080> target<00:04:22.680> going<00:04:22.920> up<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.280> there<00:04:23.490> and
