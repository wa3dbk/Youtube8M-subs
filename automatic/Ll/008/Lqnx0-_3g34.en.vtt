00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 the feet of jonathan journey won't 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 walk more under the shirt of 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.799
 PSV player decided to go for vitesse 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.990
 and that is surprising 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.210
 marcel brands a bit we sometimes become you 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.580
 in football it is is you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 disappointed further that happens and from 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 on the other hand I also go there one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.760
 little note 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.590
 given the last period that that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.630
 you had a difficult time 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.250
 yes maybe maybe it was gone with him 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.750
 the disappointment that we had at the time 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.029
 have not removed that option 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.010
 I don't know exactly from the other side 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.810
 this happens in football i think 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.060
 we as psv us 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.980
 as we become things 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.310
 our big clubs 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.680
 and yes it is a shame that 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.660
 that he goes with vitesse goes against of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.420
 on the other hand I still hope 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.270
 despite everything he became 100% fit again 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.520
 becomes psv and that graces the club because of it 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.710
 has done everything to fit Jonathan 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.210
 get first after his resignation and they 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.500
 then addiction to that heavy one 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.000
 knee injury 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.140
 from then on naturally helped him 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.520
 to look but best medical process 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.790
 and the clear ones came in the summer 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.920
 does face the dilemma after the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.410
 option lights of three years or not 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 agent have not the option 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.700
 could and wanted it light it 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.740
 financial risk was too great for ours 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.590
 have offered alternatives to tom 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.550
 to look after a year plus one 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.250
 option 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.710
 in the end that resulted in 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.729
 November in a number of conversations 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 then we have younger then too 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.119
 and we said so 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.429
 what the medical process looked like and 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.350
 that in that case we could offer it 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.190
 we got it for pc understanding then one 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 made a good offer 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.929
 we were aware that you have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.390
 the first day that it was in london 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:58.220
 in total with with Jordan and vitesse 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.440
 ok ok last week i have one 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.569
 had been informed by his agent that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.869
 that young then not our offers 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:07.009
 would go in but that for another 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.720
 future perspective 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.819
 So he goes when he is fully fit 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.819
 play in the yellow black of vitesse
