 that the guitar touches are different 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.950
 the air of light very different from that of 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.230
 flight like that because it also teaches us the 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.910
 rociera are things that are danceable 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.520

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.280
 dancers do not have a square 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.820

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.790
 a soft lounge from the king to the living room 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.950

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.310

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.720

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.310

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.080
 200 300 people to the same bo the can is 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.700
 a fandango calls him of the card that but 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.120
 nothing else that is sung in to ours 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.379
 in tango 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.150

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.010
 ask for your companions but with 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.569
 sincerity and it is not for you for example

 he defends himself well 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.000
 for ccoo because the great singers 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.989
 they do not interpret well the fandango of 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.050
 huelva because I say like everything when 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.069

 baked first floor 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:24.549
 from the cradle of the fandango 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:31.719
 the air of the uner or a school was 

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:31.719
 creating where others drank
