different directions by using the face

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
different directions by using the face
buttons<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.510> i<00:00:54.539> may<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.140> shooting

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
buttons down at the same time but you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
buttons down at the same time but you
get<00:00:59.280> used<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.789> plus<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.660> that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
get used to it plus you don't get that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
get used to it plus you don't get that
full<00:01:01.109> range<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.590> 360<00:01:02.520> degrees<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.030> shooting

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
full range of 360 degrees of shooting

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.329 
full range of 360 degrees of shooting
now<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> didn't<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> control<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> whole

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
now I didn't like the control that whole

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.190 
now I didn't like the control that whole
lot<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> synapse<00:01:06.150> levels<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.020> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
lot and synapse levels which are on

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
lot and synapse levels which are on
Rails<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.830> steer<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> ship<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.610> behind

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
Rails and you steer the ship from behind

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
Rails and you steer the ship from behind
so<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.990> these<00:01:10.140> synapse<00:01:10.560> levels<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> circle

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so in these synapse levels the circle

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.950 
so in these synapse levels the circle
pad<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.640> control<00:01:11.880> both<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.090> ami<00:01:12.390> reticle

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
pad will control both the ami reticle

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
pad will control both the ami reticle
and<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.439> ship<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.130> somewhat<00:01:14.460> cumbersome

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and the ship so it's somewhat cumbersome

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
and the ship so it's somewhat cumbersome
now<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> circle<00:01:15.869> pad<00:01:16.020> pro<00:01:16.049> may<00:01:16.530> make<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
now the circle pad pro may make the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
now the circle pad pro may make the
controls<00:01:17.310> better<00:01:17.549> well<00:01:18.180> since<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.600> have

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
controls better well since I don't have
