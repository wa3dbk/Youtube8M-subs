don't<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.660> yeah<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.410> you<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:31.950> people

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
don't you yeah and you know some people

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.740 
don't you yeah and you know some people
struggle<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.550> as<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.030> saw<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> seven<00:01:33.630> digit

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
struggle just as we saw a seven digit

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
struggle just as we saw a seven digit
numbers<00:01:34.260> yeah<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.830> trouble<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.220> numbers

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
numbers yeah the trouble with numbers

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980 
numbers yeah the trouble with numbers
they<00:01:35.550> don't<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:35.880> anything<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.240> isolation<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they don't mean anything in isolation so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.320 
they don't mean anything in isolation so
if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.100> number<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.850> nine<00:01:39.060> digit

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
if you take the number like nine digit

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.450 
if you take the number like nine digit
number<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.960> three<00:01:40.380> nine<00:01:40.770> six<00:01:41.100> four<00:01:41.400> one

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
number to one three nine six four one

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120 
number to one three nine six four one
zero<00:01:41.790> two<00:01:42.180> sounds<00:01:43.020> horrendous<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.010> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
zero two sounds horrendous but if you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.270 
zero two sounds horrendous but if you
break<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.460> down<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:45.240> chunks<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:46.440> two<00:01:47.130> one

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
break it down into chunks like two one

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.390 
break it down into chunks like two one
three<00:01:47.580> nine<00:01:48.390> six<00:01:48.570> four<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.140> zero<00:01:49.560> two<00:01:49.920> it's

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
three nine six four one zero two it's

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.040 
three nine six four one zero two it's
more<00:01:50.550> palatable<00:01:50.940> that's<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.840> right<00:01:51.900> for

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
more palatable that's all right for

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.719 
more palatable that's all right for
short-term<00:01:52.440> memory<00:01:52.830> but<00:01:53.370> if<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
short-term memory but if you want to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
short-term memory but if you want to
transfer<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.120> to<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.360> long-term<00:01:54.540> memory<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
transfer it to your long-term memory I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.620 
transfer it to your long-term memory I
break<00:01:55.440> it<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.590> into<00:01:55.830> pairs<00:01:56.370> of<00:01:56.820> numbers<00:01:56.970> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
break it down into pairs of numbers and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.249 
break it down into pairs of numbers and
I'd<00:01:57.780> make<00:01:57.900> up<00:01:58.050> a<00:01:58.110> story<00:01:58.350> okay<00:01:59.160> so<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.790> example

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
I'd make up a story okay so for example

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.749 
I'd make up a story okay so for example
21<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.410> first<00:02:01.619> two<00:02:01.740> digits<00:02:02.070> imagine<00:02:02.369> it's

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
21 of the first two digits imagine it's

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.460 
21 of the first two digits imagine it's
your<00:02:02.910> 21st<00:02:03.180> birthday<00:02:03.390> you've<00:02:03.930> got<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.050> key<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
your 21st birthday you've got a key to a

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.469 
your 21st birthday you've got a key to a
door<00:02:04.500> there's<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> key<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> tower<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
door there's a key to a tower a
mysterious<00:02:07.380> tower<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.850> go<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
steps you notice there are 39 steps in

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.810
