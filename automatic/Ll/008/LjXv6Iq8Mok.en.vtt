00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone and welcome to that you 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.250
 change lives on average doctissimo 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.319
 the French eat nearly 100 kilos 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 of meat per year and this figure has tripled 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.080
 in just a century so why 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.269
 well just because the meat 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.500
 has become more accessible 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.519
 frozen packs she has 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.960
 transformed into a few tens 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.520
 of years into a product of great 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.199
 consumption but be careful 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.150
 to excess eat too much meat can 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.859
 harm your health and the planet 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.970
 so limited his carnivorous instincts 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.970
 it changes your life 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.820
 a good rib of beef a tartare 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.410
 appetizing fleshy chops nothing 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.210
 to talk about it I know that makes you salivate 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.530
 but rest assured I do not tell you 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.580
 nor to stop completely from 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.600
 eat meat on the contrary 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.400
 since it is very rich in protein 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.260
 and then the red meat also 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.580
 may be very useful for fighting 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.650
 the anemic 1 is when we miss 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.750
 close when all is well it's three 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.950
 times a week and no more why and 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.360
 well because it is very strongly 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.670
 suspected of increasing the risks of 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.260
 colorectal cancer up to 29% 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.309
 additional risks for 100 g of 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.170
 daily consumption 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.880
 it is also the richest meat in 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.320
 fat and some studies have 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.210
 showed an increased risk of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.040
 esophageal cancer the pancreas 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.570
 lungs and stomach of the endometrium and 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 of prostate in fat 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.630
 consumers eat less meat 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.890
 it's also good for the planet a little 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.210
 people know but the production of 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.310
 meat is very energy intensive 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.140
 to give you an idea produce a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.820
 kilo of veal rejects about 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.790
 the same amount of greenhouse gases 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.200
 a 220km ride car here 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.300
 I made you a little guilty but 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.410
 it still makes you think 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.149
 ask what to replace the meat 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.220
 is well thought vegetable proteins and 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.720
 anti-soy cereals whose 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.070
 saturated fatty acids from elsewhere are good 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.570
 for your arteries and if you are 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.040
 still not convinced know that according to 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.930
 a study carried out by the students 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.520
 Harvard from vegetarians 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.750
 would have a much more sex life 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.909
 blooming and there I go out all of 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.590
 following a lot more motivated tears too 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.790
 I did my little study 1 100% of 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.799
 people who clicked the button 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.880
 subscription are in much better health 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.840
 have a good hearing 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.840
