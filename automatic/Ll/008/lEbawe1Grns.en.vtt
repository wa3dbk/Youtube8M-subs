I've been getting a lot of questions

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
I've been getting a lot of questions
about<00:00:34.649> people<00:00:34.920> asking<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.520> best<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:36.380> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
about people asking how to best use the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160 
about people asking how to best use the
solo<00:00:37.620> material<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> practice<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.170> I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
solo material how to practice it and I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
solo material how to practice it and I
wanted<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> address<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.550> pretty<00:00:42.239> quickly

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
wanted to address it in a pretty quickly

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
wanted to address it in a pretty quickly
and<00:00:42.809> again<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.829> back<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> playing

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and again just get back to the playing

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.720 
and again just get back to the playing
but<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.739> feel<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> best<00:00:47.010> way<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.129> try<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but I feel the best way to try these is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.819 
but I feel the best way to try these is
just<00:00:47.760> take<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> theory<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.559> take<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
just take the theory out of it take the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
just take the theory out of it take the
thinking<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:51.260> experiment

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
thinking out of it and just experiment

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.560 
thinking out of it and just experiment
with<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.649> works<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.010> where<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.160> doesn't

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
with where it works and where it doesn't

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
with where it works and where it doesn't
similar<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.860> you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> small<00:00:56.399> child

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
native native languages it's a lot of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.349

have<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> loop<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.439> there's<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
have a loop or do that there's a lot of

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
have a loop or do that there's a lot of
different<00:01:50.040> options<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.060> mean<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.659> are

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
different options there I mean there are

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
different options there I mean there are
plenty<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.189> practice<00:01:53.189> loops<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.820> so

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
plenty of practice loops out there so

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
plenty of practice loops out there so
just<00:01:54.780> something<00:01:55.259> that's<00:01:55.470> structured<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
just something that's structured that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.969 
just something that's structured that
you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.439> work<00:01:58.590> something

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
you can you can you know work something

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.649 
you can you can you know work something
out<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.729> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.030> kind<00:02:00.630> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
out with and just kind of kind of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.350 
out with and just kind of kind of
experiment<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.380> let's<00:02:01.829> give<00:02:02.729> an<00:02:02.820> example<00:02:03.090> here

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
experiment so let's give an example here

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959 
experiment so let's give an example here
I'm<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.469> phrase<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.610> my

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I'm going to use the phrase from my

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.869 
I'm going to use the phrase from my
third<00:02:06.869> lesson<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> solo<00:02:08.429> lick<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
third lesson from the solo lick so that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.170 
third lesson from the solo lick so that
Dexter<00:02:09.239> Gordon<00:02:09.390> lick<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:10.379> putting<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.099> link

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
Dexter Gordon lick I'm putting a link

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.580 
Dexter Gordon lick I'm putting a link
to<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.540> video<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:13.019> now<00:02:13.049> if<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.409> don't

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
to that video right now if you don't

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.869 
to that video right now if you don't
already<00:02:13.739> know<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.519> work<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.760> out

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
already know it you want to work it out

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.920 
already know it you want to work it out
but<00:02:15.659> here<00:02:16.379> it<00:02:16.469> is<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:17.209> practice<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.480> I'm<00:02:18.659> going

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
but here it is in practice and I'm going

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.740 
but here it is in practice and I'm going
to<00:02:18.989> basically<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:20.150> start<00:02:21.150> out<00:02:21.269> trying<00:02:21.510> in

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
to basically just start out trying in

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.259 
to basically just start out trying in
different<00:02:22.049> places<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.500> see<00:02:22.769> how<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.549> works<00:02:23.760> so

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
different places and see how it works so

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.619 
different places and see how it works so
here<00:02:24.719> we<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:25.969> all<00:02:26.969> right<00:02:27.030> let's<00:02:27.390> try<00:02:27.540> this

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
here we go all right let's try this

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.539 
here we go all right let's try this
first<00:02:28.049> in<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.319> most<00:02:28.500> predictable<00:02:28.950> spot<00:02:29.310> so

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
first in the most predictable spot so

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.830 
first in the most predictable spot so
we're<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.849> start<00:02:30.120> playing<00:02:30.329> this<00:02:30.510> phrase

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
we're going to start playing this phrase

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.959 
we're going to start playing this phrase
at<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.500> beginning<00:02:31.889> of<00:02:31.980> each<00:02:32.159> of<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.459> four<00:02:32.730> bar

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
at the beginning of each of the four bar

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.360 
at the beginning of each of the four bar
groupings<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.019> 12<00:02:34.319> bar<00:02:34.560> blues<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.040> first

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
groupings of this 12 bar blues so first

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.149 
groupings of this 12 bar blues so first
four<00:02:35.670> middle<00:02:36.180> four<00:02:36.420> last<00:02:37.079> four<00:02:37.439> it's<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.099> to

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
inside the box on that that location now

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.140 
inside the box on that that location now
let's<00:03:13.740> try<00:03:13.890> starting<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> second<00:03:14.940> bar

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
let's try starting it on the second bar

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
let's try starting it on the second bar
of<00:03:15.420> each<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.960> four<00:03:16.170> bar<00:03:16.350> groupings<00:03:16.830> still

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
of each of the four bar groupings still

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.620 
of each of the four bar groupings still
going<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> sound<00:03:17.730> like<00:03:17.820> Bebop<00:03:18.210> but<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.540> going

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
going to sound like Bebop but it's going

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.140 
going to sound like Bebop but it's going
to<00:03:18.720> sound<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.990> little<00:03:19.080> bit<00:03:19.230> displaced<00:03:20.150> just

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
to sound a little bit displaced just

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.460 
to sound a little bit displaced just
kind<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.420> tweak<00:03:21.630> on<00:03:21.780> our<00:03:21.870> concept<00:03:22.350> without

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
kind of a tweak on our concept without

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.970 
kind of a tweak on our concept without
changing<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> lick<00:03:23.580> at<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.180> here<00:03:24.390> we<00:03:24.480> go

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
changing the lick at all so here we go

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:48.390 
changing the lick at all so here we go
one<00:03:25.980> two<00:03:26.370> three<00:03:26.850> four

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.309 

yeah<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.700> see<00:03:49.849> it<00:03:50.000> still<00:03:50.239> sounds<00:03:50.599> like<00:03:50.720> a<00:03:50.750> good

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
yeah and see it still sounds like a good

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.860 
yeah and see it still sounds like a good
bebop<00:03:51.650> lick<00:03:51.860> but<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.540> sounds<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.569> little<00:03:53.690> bit

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
bebop lick but it's sounds a little bit

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.360 
bebop lick but it's sounds a little bit
different<00:03:53.930> now<00:03:54.709> I'm<00:03:54.799> going<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:54.980> try<00:03:55.099> something

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
different now I'm going to try something

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.680 
different now I'm going to try something
that's<00:03:55.430> going<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.700> end<00:03:55.849> up<00:03:55.909> feeling<00:03:56.599> and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
that's going to end up feeling and

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.839 
that's going to end up feeling and
sounding<00:03:56.989> very<00:03:57.170> different<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.830> starting<00:03:58.730> this

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
sounding very different is starting this

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.289 
sounding very different is starting this
phrase<00:03:59.629> on<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.349> third<00:04:00.590> beat<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:02.060> first

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
phrase on the third beat of the first

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.000 
phrase on the third beat of the first
bar<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.659> each<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.959> these<00:04:03.019> four<00:04:03.290> bar<00:04:03.530> groupings

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
bar of each of these four bar groupings

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:29.360 
bar of each of these four bar groupings
so<00:04:04.250> check<00:04:04.579> this<00:04:04.730> out<00:04:04.909> it<00:04:05.060> feels<00:04:05.269> pretty<00:04:05.930> crazy

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.830 

and<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:31.090> know<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.300> feels<00:04:31.479> like<00:04:31.780> a

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
and it you know it feels like a

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.260 
and it you know it feels like a
completely<00:04:32.259> different<00:04:32.410> phrase<00:04:32.830> but<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.460> works

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
completely different phrase but it works

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.369 
completely different phrase but it works
really<00:04:34.419> well<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.169> sounds<00:04:35.470> really<00:04:35.590> good<00:04:35.830> so

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
really well and it sounds really good so
