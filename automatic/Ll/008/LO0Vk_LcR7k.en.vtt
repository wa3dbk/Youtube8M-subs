today I just wanted to talk about the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230 
today I just wanted to talk about the
fact<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> lot<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.029> ideas

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
fact that I was I have a lot of ideas

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.560 
fact that I was I have a lot of ideas
going<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.770> lot<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.310> them<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.760> can't<00:00:21.359> do

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
going on and a lot of them I can't do

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.290 
going on and a lot of them I can't do
immediately<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.460> something<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.180> was

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
immediately but then something I was

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.189 
immediately but then something I was
thinking<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.619> lot<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> people

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
thinking of is that a lot of people

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
thinking of is that a lot of people
liked<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:28.820> training<00:00:29.820> series<00:00:30.090> when<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.330> started

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
liked my training series when I started

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
liked my training series when I started
from<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.869> reclaimed<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> built<00:00:32.130> my<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.340> up

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
from a reclaimed and built my way up

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.360 
from a reclaimed and built my way up
from<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:34.170> thinking<00:00:35.000> possibly<00:00:36.350> of

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
from that so I was thinking possibly of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.940 
from that so I was thinking possibly of
just<00:00:38.370> scrapping<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.719> series<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.770> now

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
just scrapping this series I have now

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.190 
just scrapping this series I have now
since<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.969> wasn't<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.510> very<00:00:42.540> well<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
since it wasn't going very well and I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
since it wasn't going very well and I
don't<00:00:43.739> mind<00:00:43.860> anybody<00:00:44.250> saying<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.059> even<00:00:45.840> if

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
don't mind anybody saying that even if

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.380 
don't mind anybody saying that even if
you<00:00:46.379> think<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:47.940> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
much the same thing two episodes and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.979 
much the same thing two episodes and
have<00:00:52.469> made<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.190> four<00:00:55.100> f4f<00:00:56.100> per<00:00:56.309> episode

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
have made like what four f4f per episode

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
have made like what four f4f per episode
which<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.949> good<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:01.640> but

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
which is not good at all and then but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.830 
which is not good at all and then but
then<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.030> people<00:01:03.329> liked<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
then a lot of people liked it when I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.620 
then a lot of people liked it when I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
started from a1 refined metal or like

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380 
started from a1 refined metal or like
everybody<00:01:07.439> liked<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:08.040> revolve<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.090> riches

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390

series<00:01:09.689> where<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> started<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.640> 0.33<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
series where I started from 0.33 and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
series where I started from 0.33 and
traded<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> something<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
traded up to something from that so I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.800 
traded up to something from that so I
was<00:01:14.010> thinking<00:01:14.250> instead<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.479> skipping

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
was thinking instead of just skipping

was thinking instead of just skipping

from now i'll come back to it for series
3<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.520> series<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.119> whichever<00:01:21.420> number<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> will

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
wanted revolve to riches to be then just

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.820 
wanted revolve to riches to be then just
let<00:02:33.050> me<00:02:33.140> know<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.590> really<00:02:34.130> want<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.460> just<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
let me know I really want to just do the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.040 
let me know I really want to just do the
lower<00:02:36.830> tier<00:02:37.070> one<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.880> because<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.480> I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
lower tier one just because as I

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.680 
lower tier one just because as I
remembered<00:02:39.590> there<00:02:40.430> was<00:02:40.459> like<00:02:40.970> more<00:02:41.330> trades

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
remembered there was like more trades

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.250 
remembered there was like more trades
easier<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.680> do<00:02:42.860> when<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.760> was<00:02:43.850> lower<00:02:44.000> tier<00:02:44.300> just

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
easier to do when it was lower tier just

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.040 
easier to do when it was lower tier just
because<00:02:45.590> then<00:02:46.330> well<00:02:47.330> since<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.840> was<00:02:47.930> lower

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
because then well since it was lower

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.810 
because then well since it was lower
tier<00:02:48.320> i<00:02:48.350> was<00:02:48.560> getting<00:02:48.770> more<00:02:48.890> items<00:02:49.340> cradle

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
tier i was getting more items cradle

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.390 
tier i was getting more items cradle
down<00:02:49.940> quicker<00:02:50.270> whereas<00:02:51.200> unusual<00:02:51.740> recently

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
down quicker whereas unusual recently

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.130 
down quicker whereas unusual recently
for<00:02:52.820> me<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.270> been<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.630> really<00:02:53.750> really

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
for me it's been going really really

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.350 
for me it's been going really really
slowly<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.490> just<00:02:55.910> let<00:02:55.940> me<00:02:56.030> know<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.240> you

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
slowly so just let me know what you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.510 
slowly so just let me know what you
think<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:58.600> don't<00:02:59.600> mind<00:02:59.780> whatever<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.590> say<00:03:00.830> but
