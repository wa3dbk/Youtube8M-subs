radiation<00:01:33.210> scan<00:01:33.630> Sarge<00:01:33.990> gave<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
radiation scan Sarge gave you from the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.490 
radiation scan Sarge gave you from the
base<00:01:34.829> yeah<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.939> my<00:01:35.970> pack<00:01:36.240> why<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:37.439> do

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
base yeah it's in my pack why what do

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020 
base yeah it's in my pack why what do
you<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.829> should<00:01:37.860> scan<00:01:38.310> everything
