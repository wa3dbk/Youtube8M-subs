all<00:03:28.380> right<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.100> break<00:03:29.370> both<00:03:29.610> those<00:03:29.820> sections

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
all right so break both those sections

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.020 
all right so break both those sections
down<00:03:30.420> break<00:03:30.960> them<00:03:31.170> into<00:03:31.260> smaller<00:03:31.620> subgroups

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
down break them into smaller subgroups

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.850 
down break them into smaller subgroups
connect<00:03:33.030> them<00:03:33.150> together<00:03:33.380> straight<00:03:34.380> alternate

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
connect them together straight alternate
