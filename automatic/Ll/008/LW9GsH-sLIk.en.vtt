00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
piston hammer in there his specs are

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.220 
piston hammer in there his specs are
really<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:31.590> balanced<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:33.230> back

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
really really not balanced at all back

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.200 
really really not balanced at all back
in<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.440> box

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
in the box

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.790 
in the box
side<00:00:36.210> alright<00:00:36.930> let's<00:00:37.110> open<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> take

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
side alright let's open them up and take

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.030 
side alright let's open them up and take
a<00:00:37.829> look<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> dragon<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.860> have

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
a look at the dragon so here we have

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.430 
a look at the dragon so here we have
twin<00:00:41.340> strike<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.480> probably<00:00:42.989> already

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
twin strike and as you probably already

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.160 
twin strike and as you probably already
guessed<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.210> greatly<00:00:45.210> miss<00:00:45.390> transformed

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
guessed this is greatly miss transformed

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.619 
guessed this is greatly miss transformed
from<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.190> way<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:48.120> supposed<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
from the way it's actually supposed to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
from the way it's actually supposed to
be<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.260> looks<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.620> he's<00:00:49.860> got<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.250> arms

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
be it looks like he's got little arms

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.319 
be it looks like he's got little arms
here<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.449> those<00:00:52.230> aren't<00:00:52.829> arms<00:00:53.610> they're<00:00:53.940> just

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
here but those aren't arms they're just

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.939 
here but those aren't arms they're just
completely<00:00:54.690> missed<00:00:54.960> transformed<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.860> we

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
completely missed transformed so what we

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.119 
completely missed transformed so what we
need<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.690> take<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.840> arms<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> swing

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
need to do is take the arms and swing

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.209 
need to do is take the arms and swing
them<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.750> to<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> back<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.680> figure<00:01:01.890> like

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
them up to the back of the figure like

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.820 
them up to the back of the figure like
this<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:03.539> take<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> dragon<00:01:04.140> heads<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this and then take the dragon heads and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
this and then take the dragon heads and
fold<00:01:05.250> them<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.380> around<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.840> these<00:01:09.840> will

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
fold them out and around and these will

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560 
fold them out and around and these will
actually<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> correct<00:01:11.640> arms<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
actually be the correct arms this is the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
actually be the correct arms this is the
way<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> figure<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.290> supposed<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> be

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
way the figure is supposed to be

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.240 
way the figure is supposed to be
transformed<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.200> way<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.950> plug

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
transformed and that way you can plug

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.100 
transformed and that way you can plug
you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.580> actually<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.299> him<00:01:18.570> hold<00:01:18.869> his

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you can actually have him hold his

transformation<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> pretty<00:01:53.310> easy

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
transformation is pretty easy

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.090 
transformation is pretty easy
first<00:01:54.570> we'll<00:01:54.750> come<00:01:54.930> back<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> rear<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
first we'll come back to the rear of the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609 
first we'll come back to the rear of the
figure<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> twin<00:01:57.840> tail<00:01:58.079> section

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
figure and there is a twin tail section

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.859 
figure and there is a twin tail section
that<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.860> will<00:01:59.040> fold<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.329> way<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.630> like

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
that we will fold all the way down like

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.139 
that we will fold all the way down like
that<00:02:01.310> then<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.640> open<00:02:03.000> up<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> chest<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
that then we will open up the chest and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.199 
that then we will open up the chest and
fold<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.540> head<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.710> body<00:02:08.209> though

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
fold the head up into the body though

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.720 
fold the head up into the body though
when<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.349> as<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.069> saw<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.520> just

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
when you do that as you saw I just

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.240 
when you do that as you saw I just
popped<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.180> off

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
popped it off

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.100 
popped it off
so<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.490> gotta<00:02:16.640> kind<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.210> you<00:02:17.930> got<00:02:18.080> to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
so you just gotta kind of be you got to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.470 
so you just gotta kind of be you got to
be<00:02:18.200> careful<00:02:18.680> with<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.190> guy<00:02:19.280> because<00:02:19.580> if<00:02:20.330> you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
be careful with this guy because if you

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.300 
be careful with this guy because if you
flip<00:02:20.660> them<00:02:20.870> around<00:02:20.990> too<00:02:21.440> hard<00:02:21.740> or<00:02:21.920> too<00:02:21.950> fast

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
flip them around too hard or too fast

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.450 
flip them around too hard or too fast
you<00:02:22.550> will<00:02:22.820> break<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.680> head<00:02:24.680> off<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.310> but

as<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.380> can<00:04:12.500> see<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.850> only<00:04:14.060> issue<00:04:14.209> in<00:04:14.480> this

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
as you can see the only issue in this

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.900 
as you can see the only issue in this
mode<00:04:14.840> are<00:04:15.110> these<00:04:15.260> are<00:04:15.829> these<00:04:16.040> leg<00:04:16.310> pieces<00:04:16.729> they

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
mode are these are these leg pieces they

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.819 
mode are these are these leg pieces they
tend<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.390> flop<00:04:17.870> up<00:04:18.049> out<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.200> bit<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.560> they<00:04:18.650> don't

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
tend to flop up out a bit and they don't

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.820 
tend to flop up out a bit and they don't
really<00:04:18.950> peg<00:04:19.280> into<00:04:19.609> place<00:04:19.910> so<00:04:20.810> that's<00:04:21.590> a

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
really peg into place so that's a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.740 
really peg into place so that's a
problem<00:04:22.280> but<00:04:22.610> otherwise<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.270> figure<00:04:23.510> looks

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
problem but otherwise the figure looks

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.839 
problem but otherwise the figure looks
good<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.200> it's<00:04:24.470> fine<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:25.070> beast<00:04:25.340> mode

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
good and it's fine in beast mode

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.129 
good and it's fine in beast mode

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
into the rear legs of hunger so these

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.189 
into the rear legs of hunger so these

going to be a peg coming off hunger that

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.629 
going to be a peg coming off hunger that
will<00:05:47.180> peg<00:05:47.419> into<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:47.899> chest<00:05:48.349> here<00:05:48.740> I'm<00:05:48.889> at
