00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.080
 yes hello comes together to one 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 another building on this awaits 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.130
 Saturday and there in the last reallife 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 Gameplay has found great acceptance and 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 the deck has aroused interest where Leuer 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.430
 I have implemented this here now 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.260
 this is the trader or barca trader 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.939
 deck of treat and apple the list 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.769
 kindly provided and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.650
 I 've budgeted a bit so 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 a bit the price level lowered that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.570
 deck is still at its core 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.760
 So it was a very nice game 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.430
 the costs already addressed in now 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 pay about 20 to 25 euros on magic 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 card does not carry postage as always 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.399
 really lower budget range would 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.870
 I can say that is nice to implement the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.510
 Maps are sometimes quite new as well 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.670
 easy to get and yes definitely as 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.930
 budget was feasible here and is up 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.219
 every case a very nice van dyck 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.219
 The game can be very nice synergies 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.059
 you may not see so often 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 The name of the decks is the bazaar 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.829
 Trader is goblin for 2011 and abt 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.210
 a player gets control 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.210
 an artifact a creature your land 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.010
 which one controls itself something like that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 you do that with the very first 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.799
 brussels by secutor at the same time bidder 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.600
 as well as nice trick is a demon for 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.400
 four painters 66 fly so trample 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.420
 neat other cost provider has 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.100
 but the side effect you can 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.090
 win independently and the opponent 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.549
 can not lose the game 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.960
 so not so good at first 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.970
 but look if we have our bazaar trader 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.970
 So we have the enemy four times 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.530
 he 24 damage a total of trails 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.610
 So mostly four attacks reach 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.590
 In any case that you harm enough 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.150
 gets through and then you push the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.500
 creature you control yourself so 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.360
 the trial user simply to the opponent 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 over and you immediately won the game 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.770
 is still pretty simple 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.329
 Of course, we are going strong and overpowering 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.009
 you can be a bit Persian earlier 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.540
 it can push the opponent over 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.220
 we can not win the game anymore and we 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.280
 then you can not lose anymore so ne 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.869
 very nice energy here in this way 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 then we have the Bronx Bomber shell 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.570
 is never wrong four men 41 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.700
 if a player is not the owner 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.170
 This card is controlled 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 you immediately sacrifice and win 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.340
 hurt so we push the bosses was 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 over seven harms instant gives 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.039
 of course even better things here in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.569
 The work of the abo is twice in 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.240
 this memorial for four men seven 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.020
 harm is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.340
 but there is better then we have 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.990
 Martini and Eck often have both 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.460
 about the same effects as 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.900
 take control over one 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.760
 Creature to the end of the train 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.500
 you will always get a tab hurry 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.990
 marketing gets this chain plus 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.520
 one plus one brand take us 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.630
 of course an opposing creature in 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.490
 of course we are the moment 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.020
 controller but want the end is 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.660
 we can not give back so we can 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.980
 use the bazaar trader and one here 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.980
 creature we control 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.750
 even if it is only this moment a 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.520
 So players give the control one 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.070
 give players that are of course we 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.240
 we give the quasi and ourselves 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.650
 control over a creature we 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.830
 but already in time 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.360
 origin opposite and the antl end of 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.100
 turn effect is overwritten and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.540
 the creature is a permanent part of us 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.710
 For all that , I want to be very nice 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.780
 You can look at the opponent and him with it 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.760
 his creatures clown martini and corners 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.530
 often so recognized four times available 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.570
 Of course, very nice additions are still 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.370
 You do not have fly or old streep 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.360
 Bazaar trader on the field when takes over 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.160
 one for that control over the 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.870
 opposing creature attacks with it 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.130
 nimble then goes directly to the opponent 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.350
 head or openness to a creature 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.400
 if it is still some danger that 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.930
 flying has as much damage as that 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.580
 creature had stronger in any case 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.470
 very nice effect alternative age 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.270
 Street it becomes the opposing creature 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.640
 to make the advantage of our cards 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.110
 Of course , super strong for twice 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.160
 additional costs is stated that they are against 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.780
 with four goals ever directly from the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.420
 play and we draw two cards 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.980
 that in any case really really strong 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.270
 and then we have one more right 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.490
 combo in which covers our game 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.470
 immediately wins and although in place has for 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.000
 four painters you can tap two 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.720
 cards in our own cemetery ins 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.930
 send exile 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.670
 his card will be used for us or 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.990
 if the owner of the model call 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.460
 damage is inflicted will damage 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.260
 prevented and instead for everyone 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.180
 changed a card from the damage 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.190
 cemetery and or the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.210
 side effect like most cards 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.990
 then of course if they have good 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.460
 have effects 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.200
 if you have no more cards in the cemetery 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.700
 Of course you lose the game 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.380
 do you want the models with the buzzer 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.420
 mistake the opponent or shoot 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.610
 shove over he said before with 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.590
 the buck the enemy the whole cemetery 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.090
 this is also an author in exile 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.380
 so nice combo in mortal coil 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.970
 JÃ¼terbog and basalt trader support 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.980
 Of course , utility cards are also important 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.390
 we can not destroy everything here in the 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.130
 moment in the reason is pitt were four 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.930
 terminals in the deck destroyed and one 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.410
 Of course, creature is hard as mark 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.390
 hughes 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.220
 and often already had a lot to take over 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.800
 but you want to be sure of the number 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.600
 and also has terminal completely 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.250
 very important as you want of course 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.630
 Opponent take the removal from the hand 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.520
 or count out of hand, we take 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.740
 our combos energies or the bazaar 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.600
 simply kill trader dress 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.670
 do not let the enemy creature 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.140
 drop off map at our option 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.260
 shows us the hand that very well 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.940
 and will harm three for three men 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.800
 must throw off two cards also a very 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.090
 strong cards continue the opponent 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.740
 limit 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.240
 yes what is the mahner base doing now 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.650
 here very budgeted next to the three blue 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.760
 box already explained itself 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.860
 along with the the mortal coil have 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.140
 we four times dragons kassa with that he 13 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.610
 dual call me now is a good one 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.140
 ticket costs in place at maybe 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.090
 six euros super good you can of course 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.920
 here also wowereit or terrie moffitt 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.110
 Expands play the usual budget 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.400
 Of course, six countries should do so 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.130
 we wanted and all that I have then 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.180
 filled with standard countries yes im 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.370
 main deck you could of course one 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.690
 fourth piste persike utah can play 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.130
 to rebuild a bit because you are 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.390
 has too much removal or the enemy at 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.470
 Do not play many creatures at all 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.590
 you can also take out the terminals 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.270
 More of the kathrein do so with tutors 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.190
 reintun so here you have one more 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.570
 a bit of freedom the mana base like 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.280
 always with magic you can be so expensive 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.320
 Shaping as you wish means you as 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.300
 So do other dual countries 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.730
