with<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:03.050> crock<00:06:03.470> pot<00:06:03.500> so<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.909> have<00:06:05.330> a<00:06:05.629> 2-cup

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
with the crock pot so I have a 2-cup

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.490 
with the crock pot so I have a 2-cup
container<00:06:06.919> here<00:06:07.370> to<00:06:08.000> fork<00:06:08.419> up<00:06:08.539> containers<00:06:09.199> and

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
container here to fork up containers and

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.399 
container here to fork up containers and
then<00:06:10.099> this<00:06:10.340> is<00:06:10.490> probably<00:06:10.669> a<00:06:11.240> fork<00:06:11.960> up<00:06:12.169> and<00:06:12.379> a

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
then this is probably a fork up and a

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.129 
then this is probably a fork up and a
fork<00:06:12.710> up<00:06:12.919> and<00:06:13.190> a<00:06:13.520> 5<00:06:13.759> cup<00:06:14.090> maybe<00:06:14.300> or<00:06:14.599> maybe

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
fork up and a 5 cup maybe or maybe

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.830 
fork up and a 5 cup maybe or maybe
deserve<00:06:15.560> 5<00:06:15.889> cups<00:06:16.220> I'm<00:06:16.490> not<00:06:16.639> really<00:06:16.789> sure<00:06:16.940> but

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
deserve 5 cups I'm not really sure but

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.439 
deserve 5 cups I'm not really sure but
