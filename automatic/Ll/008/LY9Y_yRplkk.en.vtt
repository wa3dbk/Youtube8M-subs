00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.630
 and thanks for being here again the insipid speaks 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.630
 and now let's discuss for a while what only rational numbers 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.030
 we previously discussed what a whole number was 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.430
 and now we're going to see that a whole number is part of one more group 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.820
 big it's called the rational numbers 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.850
 and what rational number for simply rational numbers a 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.349
 number that can be expressed as a reason don omar montero 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.529
 or what is the same a fraction 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.669
 in this case we see a version like x on ye 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.320
 and for this they were national place 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 in kylie both would have to be whole number 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.660
 a simple example ejido rational number 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 the number zero points 5 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.470
 that can also be written as a leftover still gave me 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.660
 and we see that one 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 about the object of his man whole number 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.960
 as we said whole number bread 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 to be part of the rational numbers and because in that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.580
 Well simply because all the rumors but just rational 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.300
 the demonstration is simple any whole number 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 I can put it on 1 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.360
 and equivalent and at the same time in a whole number 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.530
 about another whole name and the definition of rational numbers 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.160
 in a whole number reason so any whole number 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.970
 the rational number 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.119
 simply with the whole number they put it on 1 and already a rational man 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 the numbers and can not be lent in different way 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.690
 in this case we see the finite decimals the decimals had are 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.270
 or how can we barak and decimals that have end 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.109
 in this case a means 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.950
 can be written as 0 points 5 and as soon as he knew how to describe zero point 

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:38.900
 25 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.880
 But it's not always like this 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.110
 what happens in the case of a third one would say among others 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.670
 if we do it to the calculator 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.180
 We will choose on request 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.220
 they will see what 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.720
 1 divided between train 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.229
 equal to zero point brought the 3rd asks infinitely 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.460
 the calculator 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 it was written by men or simply 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.850
 chases calculator 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.369
 I will continue to continue and continue the 13 days repeating itself is in the mind 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.699
 what happens in this case 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.769
 was this what is called a periodic infinite decimal number 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.979
 infinite because it repeats infinitely and periodic that keeps repeating 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.809
 exactly the same number 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:23.269
 and it is written as zero point 3 with a bar on the train 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.520
 and leopard the bullfighter who tells me is that the number 13 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.020
 infinitely repeated 19 vita I showed vilo all those times 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.449
 and these infinite decimal numbers newspaper 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.979
 they are rational 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.459
 yes yes if you second from the definition of national humor eln in a reason of 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.509
 whole number 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.989
 therefore zero train point / 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.039
 which means that the train repeats itself endless times 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:51.219
 the same as some lived from the robbery a third that a reason of whole number 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.809
 and in many cases with used data 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.019
 for example the reason for it one on nine 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.819
 the number zero navarra point where then repeated infinitely 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.439
 and that same thing happens with the 2 over nine 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.029
 that closed with everything / the 4 over nine that the zero point 4 / 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.769
 5 out of nine 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.539
 and the 2 on train 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.179
 that in two thirds it is also written as 0 points and ibarra where 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:16.549
 emitted kelsey 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.399
 it is written infinitely 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.789
 Now look at this number 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.709
 will be this eleventh to the infinite newspaper 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.359
 let's look at it with 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.799
 care 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.819
 if they have if they are fixed after the decimal point let's see what this is 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.950
 encounter number 1 4 2 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.879
 holes 5 7 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.129
 then we go again the 1 4 8 and 5 7 a 4 8 5 7 to 1 4 8 and 5 7 and if I continue 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:44.009
 typing 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.059
 there may be cases are flooded are repeated 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.709
 periodically 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.379
 and in an infinite way 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.899
 therefore this number one decimal 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.839
 infinite newspaper 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:58.879
 so you can see in this case that not only happens happens with homero 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.109
 alone but with number combinations 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.230
 to repeat themselves 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.319
 periodically infinitely as they are infinite decimal periodic 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.969
 sybase mÃ¡laga collaborates can see that this number the number one seventh if 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.909
 well presents 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.449
 and the point 1 4 2 8 5 7 goes repeating is going to repeat infinitely 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.129
 for me in this case 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.169
 the day 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.490
 left over 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.389
 whistles day between 12 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.370
 is going to have it repeating infinitely 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.830
 to see what the zero point 8 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.830
 and then it repeats infinitely 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.860
 but he has only done it once 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.819
 what happens in this case 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.599
 in this case 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.690
 the name given to this number is the decimal 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.180
 infinite newspaper mix 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.160
 and in Mexico because it has a combination of repeating numbers 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.100
 infinitely periodically and number that he does not repeat 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.819
 and in this case this other different number 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.379
 it looks but not the same 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.379
 is zero points 0 8 3 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.879
 where what he tells me here is that he 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.479
 points 0 8 was only activated once 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.940
 and the 3 that the one that contains the bar and that is written infinitely 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.229
 so by way of touching review rational numbers 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.630
 this other definition 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.870
 they are all good that can be represented 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.670
 as the quotient of two whole 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.110
 agreed mined the distinct being 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.469
 what is the same with the common fraction 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:33.599
 and we had reviewed whole Nuncan shrimp that could be negative like the 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.670
 negative 5 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.029
 zero or positive like 40 and the 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.499
 the fraction m 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:43.079
 that are reasons for number but in this case in all three cases we are seeing 

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.150
 here eleven out of 25 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.180
 three quarters of a half 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.560
 the finite decimals that only that they have an end in this case we can see the 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.320
 zero when 44 0 points 75 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.539
 and zero points 5 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.699
 lotus and bad infinite newspaper that we live or decimals where a number 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.020
 it repeats infinitely periodically 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.790
 zero point 3/0 point 4 / 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.289
 and only point 4 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.289
 only point 1 4 2 4 5 7 / 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.650
 the bar tells me the number that will be repeated infinitely and 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.749
 periodically 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:20.099
 and the decimal numbers infinite newspaper mixed 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.020
 only numbers where 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.190
 only decimals where some numbers are repeated so 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.439
 infinite periodic and another no 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:29.779
 mista mixed 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.419
 as in this case that was point 0 8 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.210
 where they do not repeat themselves 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.229
 never the point 0 8 only tribune by the train / means that the 3 write of 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:40.259
 way 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.259
 infinite and periodic 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.909
 we already know what rational numbers are 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.519
 now for next video as what only irrational number
