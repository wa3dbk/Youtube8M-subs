 a cedé is not going to be a web page 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.440

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.530
 Spanish group called Ancor worth

 to sing in English because as you know 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.890
 Spanish we all know how to see the case 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.189
 is that it's a Spanish group called 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.630
 ancor vale I leave you there your subject so that 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.759

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.000
 paypal that puts a donor that is like 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.560
 donor but with inverted vowels 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.569
 for you to leave a tip if you 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.849
 like it's free I like it and it's metal 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 new young people I sing a girl that is 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.310
 prettier than me and it's nicer to see 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.780
 what to watch this video 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.209
 then if you want you have a good time 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 ancor the biologist of today who 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.570
 that was the stupidity of the movie 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.569
 slasher from before good is going to about 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.130
 technical fears because you tell me fuck 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.650
 fuck uncle I have a lot of fears 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.550
 had when my girlfriend because my parents 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.330
 why 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.280
 because I'm scared good then I'm going 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.780
 to give a series of tips because if 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.450
 that friends have all passed us 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.670
 including me better have fears 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.470
 train and scenic or we have a little bit of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.489
 such in fact if they do not get nervous before 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.680
 to get on stage is that you are 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.940
 fucking very nice then it is 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.040
 logical that you have those little things but 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.780
 good how to overcome nerves and how 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.489
 overcome scenic fear good the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.860
 first point according to víctor de andrés is 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.200
 rehearse mogollón teach a lot of vale there 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.090
 to teach a lot because in itself 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.620
 playing live is much more difficult and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.420
 it's only once I do not eat when I'm 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.790
 preparing in the trial in the local 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.440
 then the first point is that you have to 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.030
 rehearse a lot that happens when 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.830
 we are live the second point that 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.989
 we have a lot of tension tensions 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.000
 we are nervous they bring us something not if 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.680
 we have our head in a thousand places the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.420
 stomach gives us good laps must 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.640
 reduce stress and release tension 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.300
 in what way then well eating 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.760
 pipes 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.130
 I know if smoking gum sucking 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.080
 you smoke a cartridge what you do you have to 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.590
 reducing stress is one of the things 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.590
 How are you 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 that is, we have stage fright and we stop 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.680
 delay delay it to delay it to 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.240
 delay the retarded and when 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.410
 we got to be from then but the 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.180
 prayer to touch the fear is technical 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.220
 is going to multiply by two minimum and if 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.960
 it's not for me so I get time later 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.080
 another thing that needs to be done is 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.040
 avoid stimulants 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.050
 is stimulating the whole caffeine 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.270
 what ends up in line etcetera etcetera 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.680
 because because if we do not have a whore 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.030
 paranoia or point more fear stage 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.100
 because it is what makes everything just 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.040
 nor then avoid the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.390
 stimulants and it's fine and then the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.250
 Biggest advice that I can tell you is 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.209
 that as we always have tension or good 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.950
 that's what has always 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.540
 operated the latter of all is more 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.580
 important in fact I think it's the most 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.190
 important for everything in life is that of 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.630
 have fun and laugh a lot 6 and friends and there 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.280
 to laugh a lot because if you laugh 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.870
 long before a concert you spend it 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.060
 you're super good 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.610
 relaxed you will not have tension and you 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.650
 Scenic fear will surely be much 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.940
 minor and nothing more thank you very much for 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.010
