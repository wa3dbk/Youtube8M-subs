grow on so when we've got a bunch of
little<00:01:07.090> itsy-bitsy<00:01:07.450> baby<00:01:07.840> cucumbers<00:01:08.200> here

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
little itsy-bitsy baby cucumbers here

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.220 
little itsy-bitsy baby cucumbers here
growing<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.580> what<00:01:10.570> did<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.810> want<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.050> point

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
growing and what did you want to point

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.040 
growing and what did you want to point
out<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.560> me<00:01:11.590> okay<00:01:12.160> so<00:01:12.220> this<00:01:13.150> one<00:01:13.450> has<00:01:13.720> been

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
out to me okay so this one has been

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.710 
out to me okay so this one has been
properly<00:01:15.060> pollinated<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:16.510> tell

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
properly pollinated and you can tell

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.350 
properly pollinated and you can tell
because<00:01:16.810> it's<00:01:17.080> starting<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.560> grow<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:19.060> one

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
because it's starting to grow this one

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.240 
because it's starting to grow this one
it's<00:01:20.050> hard<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.409> tell<00:01:20.560> if<00:01:20.650> it's<00:01:20.770> been<00:01:20.920> properly

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
it's hard to tell if it's been properly

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.660 
it's hard to tell if it's been properly
pollinated<00:01:21.909> yet<00:01:22.120> this<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:22.570> wasn't<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.670> yeah

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
pollinated yet this one wasn't and yeah

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.670 
pollinated yet this one wasn't and yeah
what<00:01:25.150> we<00:01:25.270> found<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.870> that<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.200> ones<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.590> we

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
what we found is that the ones that we

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.320 
what we found is that the ones that we
don't<00:01:26.770> get<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.190> in<00:01:27.310> time<00:01:27.340> or<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:27.880> don't<00:01:28.150> get

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
don't get to in time or just don't get

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.330 
don't get to in time or just don't get
pollinated<00:01:28.659> naturally<00:01:29.260> immediately<00:01:30.040> start

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
pollinated naturally immediately start

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.090 
pollinated naturally immediately start
to<00:01:30.520> shrivel<00:01:30.820> up<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.330> it's<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.800> can<00:01:32.950> come

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
to shrivel up and it's like you can come

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.390 
to shrivel up and it's like you can come
out<00:01:33.159> once<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.300> then<00:01:34.450> come<00:01:34.630> out<00:01:34.720> again<00:01:35.020> like

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
out once and then come out again like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.010 
out once and then come out again like
two<00:01:36.400> hours<00:01:36.580> later<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.510> would<00:01:37.660> they're

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
two hours later and you would they're

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.110 
two hours later and you would they're
noticeably<00:01:38.650> smaller<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.160> browner<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:40.090> I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
noticeably smaller and browner so I

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.960 
noticeably smaller and browner so I
found<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.870> we<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.350> pretty<00:01:41.650> quickly<00:01:41.970> what

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
found that we know pretty quickly what

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.880 
found that we know pretty quickly what
the<00:01:43.090> fate<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.540> of<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.930> cucumbers<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.680> how

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the fate is of the cucumbers and how

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.880 
the fate is of the cucumbers and how
exactly<00:01:45.100> do<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.580> pollinate<00:01:46.000> these<00:01:46.330> by<00:01:46.570> hand

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
exactly do you pollinate these by hand

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.230 
exactly do you pollinate these by hand
what<00:01:48.300> how<00:01:49.300> I<00:01:49.330> do<00:01:49.570> it<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.230> take<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.150> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
what how I do it is I take one of the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.730 
what how I do it is I take one of the
male<00:01:52.480> flowers<00:01:53.790> mm-hmm

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
male flowers mm-hmm

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.660 
male flowers mm-hmm
and<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.100> it'll<00:01:56.310> come<00:01:56.340> off<00:01:56.610> easily<00:01:56.970> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.100 

what<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.409> peel<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:06.420> petals<00:02:06.840> down

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
what I do is I just peel the petals down

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.650 
what I do is I just peel the petals down
like<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.340> mm-hmm<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> part

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
like so mm-hmm and then this is the part

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.100 
like so mm-hmm and then this is the part
here<00:02:13.170> because<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.010> pollen<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.989> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
here because the pollen on it and then I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.010 
here because the pollen on it and then I
take<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.590> into

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.020

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
that's good I suppose yeah yeah so we've

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.710 
that's good I suppose yeah yeah so we've
also<00:03:11.980> got<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> second<00:03:12.760> window<00:03:13.000> box<00:03:13.210> that<00:03:13.570> we

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
also got the second window box that we

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.140 
also got the second window box that we
are<00:03:13.870> hoping<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.470> grow<00:03:14.770> some<00:03:15.100> flowers<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.670> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
are hoping to grow some flowers and and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.240 
are hoping to grow some flowers and and
the<00:03:16.660> idea<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.110> flowers<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.830> hopefully

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
the idea the flowers is that hopefully

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.840 
the idea the flowers is that hopefully
they<00:03:18.400> will<00:03:19.800> attract<00:03:20.800> insects<00:03:21.460> which<00:03:21.730> are

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
they will attract insects which are

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.990 
they will attract insects which are
going<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.030> help<00:03:22.210> us<00:03:22.330> pollinate<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.760> that's

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
going to help us pollinate so that's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.520 
going to help us pollinate so that's
sort<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.870> come<00:03:26.080> on<00:03:26.200> along<00:03:26.380> slowly<00:03:26.830> but<00:03:27.130> surely

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
sort of come on along slowly but surely
