this<00:00:01.979> video<00:00:02.280> today<00:00:02.520> shows<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.419> results<00:00:04.020> from

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
this video today shows the results from

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.970 
this video today shows the results from
a<00:00:04.680> simulation<00:00:05.549> test<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.420> SolidWorks<00:00:06.990> we're

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
a simulation test in SolidWorks we're

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.610 
a simulation test in SolidWorks we're
simulating<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:09.030> wheel<00:00:09.330> hitting<00:00:10.230> against<00:00:10.559> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
simulating a wheel hitting against a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.310 
simulating a wheel hitting against a
curb<00:00:11.179> what<00:00:12.179> we're<00:00:12.330> doing<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.990> we're<00:00:13.200> actually

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
curb what we're doing is we're actually

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.630 
curb what we're doing is we're actually
allowing<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.190> drop<00:00:14.730> test<00:00:15.389> our<00:00:15.990> drop<00:00:16.410> weight<00:00:16.980> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
allowing a drop test our drop weight of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.140 
allowing a drop test our drop weight of
1,600<00:00:18.570> pounds<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.800> against<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.460> wheel<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
1,600 pounds to be against the wheel and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.170 
1,600 pounds to be against the wheel and
yes<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> Liam<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.830> weight<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.699> being

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
yes the Liam and that weight is being

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.200 
yes the Liam and that weight is being
applied<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.109> wheel<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.670> wheel<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
applied to that wheel as that wheel is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.620 
applied to that wheel as that wheel is
that<00:00:27.480> 13<00:00:27.930> degree<00:00:28.199> angle<00:00:28.619> from<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.160> horizontal

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
that 13 degree angle from the horizontal

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.060 
that 13 degree angle from the horizontal
axis<00:00:30.769> now<00:00:31.940> this<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.149> also<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.870> continuation<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
axis now this is also a continuation of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190 
axis now this is also a continuation of
that<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> movie<00:00:36.870> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that the first one was the movie that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
that the first one was the movie that
you<00:00:37.410> saw<00:00:37.790> actually<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> avi<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.510> was

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you saw actually the avi that was

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.319 
you saw actually the avi that was
created<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.290> SolidWorks<00:00:40.969> this<00:00:41.969> actually

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
created in SolidWorks this actually

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
created in SolidWorks this actually
gives<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> results<00:00:43.559> shows<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
gives you the results shows you what the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.060 
gives you the results shows you what the
stresses<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.800> Dark

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
stresses are as you can see the Dark

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
stresses are as you can see the Dark
Blues<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:48.059> good<00:00:48.680> they<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.980> under<00:00:50.219> any

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
Blues are good they are not under any

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
Blues are good they are not under any
stress<00:00:50.700> whereas<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.629> color<00:00:52.140> starts<00:00:52.500> changing

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
stress whereas the color starts changing

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.369 
stress whereas the color starts changing
to<00:00:53.039> green<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> yellow<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.140> red

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to green then the yellow and then to red

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
to green then the yellow and then to red
you<00:00:56.100> start<00:00:56.370> seeing<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.030> more<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you start seeing more and more of the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
you start seeing more and more of the
stress<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.100> really

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
stress and as you can see this is really

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.119 
stress and as you can see this is really
a<00:00:59.489> true<00:00:59.789> picture<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.920> SolidWorks<00:01:01.920> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
a true picture of what SolidWorks is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
a true picture of what SolidWorks is
actually<00:01:02.520> doing<00:01:02.940> by<00:01:03.329> applying<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> pressure

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
actually doing by applying that pressure

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.920 
actually doing by applying that pressure
to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> top<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> ground<00:01:06.630> being

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to the top of this with the ground being

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.340 
to the top of this with the ground being
at<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> bottom<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:08.119> fixed<00:01:09.119> ground<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
at the bottom a fixed ground at that and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890 
at the bottom a fixed ground at that and
then<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> wheel<00:01:10.860> sitting<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.340> top<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
then the wheel sitting on top of it it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
then the wheel sitting on top of it it
allows<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> stresses<00:01:14.729> are

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
allows you to see what the stresses are

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
allows you to see what the stresses are
going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.650> rim<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
going to be on this rim as that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.270 
going to be on this rim as that
contact<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.229> weight<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.950> placed

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
contact our is that weight that's placed

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.420 
contact our is that weight that's placed
upon<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:21.479> again<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.200> said

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
upon it which again like I said

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.130 
upon it which again like I said
simulates<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> wheel<00:01:24.180> actually<00:01:24.509> hitting<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
simulates the wheel actually hitting the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.340 
simulates the wheel actually hitting the
curb<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:26.759> again<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.689> different<00:01:28.080> view

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
curb this again is just a different view

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
curb this again is just a different view
and<00:01:28.380> isometric<00:01:29.100> view<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> will<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and isometric view if you will of that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.270 
and isometric view if you will of that
same<00:01:31.470> room

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
same room

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.780 
same room
showing<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.470> where<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> stress<00:01:35.340> points<00:01:35.700> are

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
showing you where the stress points are

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.609 
showing you where the stress points are
at<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> stress

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
at and as you can see here the stress

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.819 
at and as you can see here the stress
points<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.210> top<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:39.750> edges<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
points are on the top two edges of that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.469 
points are on the top two edges of that
room<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> highest<00:01:41.640> points<00:01:42.180> where<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
room at the highest points where the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170 
room at the highest points where the
contact<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> made<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.670> has<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> true

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
contact is made and that has a true

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.420 
contact is made and that has a true
picture<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.619> goes<00:01:47.009> towards<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
picture here and as it goes towards the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.969 
picture here and as it goes towards the
center<00:01:47.790> where<00:01:48.000> there's<00:01:48.149> less<00:01:48.420> stress<00:01:48.979> these

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
center where there's less stress these

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.770 
center where there's less stress these
two<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> colors<00:01:50.640> merging<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
two the colors merging back into the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
two the colors merging back into the
blue<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> light<00:01:52.560> blue<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.159> even<00:01:53.280> into

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
blue and the light blue and even into

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.410 
blue and the light blue and even into
the<00:01:54.210> green<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:56.399> remainder<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.180> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the green so the remainder of this is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.190 
the green so the remainder of this is
basically<00:01:57.869> showing<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.469> different<00:01:58.740> types<00:01:59.310> of

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
basically showing you different types of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.399 
basically showing you different types of
freefall<00:02:01.759> freefall<00:02:02.759> being<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.259> can

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
freefall freefall being that you can

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.880 
freefall freefall being that you can
actually<00:02:04.740> test<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> freefall<00:02:07.229> weight

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
actually test this as a freefall weight

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.029 
actually test this as a freefall weight
without<00:02:08.369> any<00:02:08.759> control<00:02:09.179> whatsoever<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.590> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
without any control whatsoever and you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.360 
without any control whatsoever and you
can<00:02:11.160> also<00:02:11.310> got<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
can also got it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.930 
can also got it
and<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.180> weight<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.810> being<00:02:14.080> placed

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
and this this weight is being placed

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.260 
and this this weight is being placed
about<00:02:15.940> nine<00:02:16.240> inches<00:02:16.750> above<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.800> 9.15<00:02:18.640> actually

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
about nine inches above or 9.15 actually

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.070 
about nine inches above or 9.15 actually
inches<00:02:19.990> above<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.440> rim<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:22.420> tests<00:02:22.840> here

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
inches above the rim and the tests here

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.370 
inches above the rim and the tests here
are<00:02:23.290> showing<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.890> two<00:02:24.160> different<00:02:24.280> ways<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:25.150> is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
are showing it two different ways one is

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.710 
are showing it two different ways one is
in<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.500> freefall<00:02:26.830> situation<00:02:27.819> while<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.480> other

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
in a freefall situation while the other

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.790 
in a freefall situation while the other
is<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.770> guided<00:02:30.120> situation<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.500> one<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.620> them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
is in a guided situation and one of them

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.880 
is in a guided situation and one of them
is<00:02:32.890> actually<00:02:33.100> falling<00:02:33.720> from<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.959> less<00:02:35.290> height

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
is actually falling from a less height

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.210 
is actually falling from a less height
than<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.819> guy<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> guy<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.900> is

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
than the guy to be is the guy that is

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.150 
than the guy to be is the guy that is
9.15<00:02:39.450> whereas<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.660> freefall<00:02:41.170> is<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:42.010> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
9.15 whereas the freefall is just a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
9.15 whereas the freefall is just a
little<00:02:42.550> bit<00:02:42.700> less<00:02:43.540> than<00:02:43.750> nine<00:02:43.989> so<00:02:45.030> gives<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
little bit less than nine so gives you a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.850 
little bit less than nine so gives you a
good<00:02:46.420> idea<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.410> power<00:02:47.590> of

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
good idea of what the power of

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.610 
good idea of what the power of
simulation<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.060> SolidWorks<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.470> can

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
simulation is in SolidWorks that it can

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.759 
simulation is in SolidWorks that it can
actually<00:02:50.800> determine<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.209> power<00:02:52.510> or<00:02:52.989> the

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
actually determine the power or the

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.620 
actually determine the power or the
stress<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.820> rhythm<00:02:55.480> as<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.260> hits<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.040> curb

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
stress on a rhythm as it hits a curb

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.320 
stress on a rhythm as it hits a curb
with<00:02:58.630> 1,600<00:02:59.350> pounds<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.830> force<00:03:00.190> against<00:03:01.150> that

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
with 1,600 pounds of force against that

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.720 
with 1,600 pounds of force against that
rim<00:03:01.630> in<00:03:02.560> two<00:03:02.800> different<00:03:02.950> methods<00:03:03.489> one

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
rim in two different methods one
