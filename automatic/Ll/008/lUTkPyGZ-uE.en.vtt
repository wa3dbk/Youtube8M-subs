00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.899
 difficult because when we drink in 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.780

 shit and diatta time squats 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.530
 after the appearance meets the tastes there 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 you know a good rank drive must 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.660

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.479
 side windsor he sees a guy who 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.610

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.860
 killed his co common point was average 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.300
 bourhis everywhere while mc it's 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.160

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 of mentally ill because he stride 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.940
 quietly at the baptism of fire in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.110
 killing of Korian do ron psig 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.430
 so far the classic when all the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.900
 world does that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.580

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.910
 but what happens in the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.080
 ship for that pilot like that because 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.299
 that at the base he should fly 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
 I'm going to show you we've managed to 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:32.640
