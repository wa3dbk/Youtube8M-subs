00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 I've always wanted to work with games since 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.790
 when I was a child 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.110
 It's but I did not imagine that I was going to 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.510
 get to work with games and me 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.640
 sustain for so many years 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 so it's every day I go 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.310
 work for me is a dream 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.690
 accomplished 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.990
 to be able to work in what you always 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.510
 wanted to work as a child and is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 winning for this having fun being 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.160
 happy and making people have fun 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.510
 while the product for me is a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 realized dream 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.739
 I think when I was about 10 years old I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 I saw a making off of the empire strikes back 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.210
 star wars second episode 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 I was so amazed by what I 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.219
 those neighboring small ones those 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 those controlled explosions and I 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.460
 I remember asking myself what you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.800
 Do you want to be when you grow up there? 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 to work with cinema do there but not 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 You may, because I did not see that kind of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 movie in Brazil today sometimes I go back 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.560
 Back home, I'm doing exactly the same. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.679
 I wish I did not want to do cinema. 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.319
 doing is working entertainment with 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.090
 the games to find a stranger because 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.259
 I stayed a long time sometimes at home. 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 playing video games with your friends 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.890
 were in the mouth ball 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.760
 I always liked art ever 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.320
 I really liked fun and for me the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.150
 games they make this combination of 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.860
 perfect way when you have all 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.230
 the artistic elements present in 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.150
 Businesswoman has fun wondering how it is 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.270
 makes a game is fundamental independent 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.800
 of the area that you will operate within the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 development of a game 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.600
 whether you are an artist a game designer or 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.000
 screenwriter a use to know the process is well 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.810
 with the moment you enter it is crucial to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.810
 do a good job 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.929
 the game designer has to know 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.469
 basically create challenges that are 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.539
 interesting challenges is that at the same time 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.329
 time are not so easy for the 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.190
 player to get bored and abandon the 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.049
 game that are not as difficult to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.420
 anxiety player to reach the 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.420
 frustrated goal does not move the player away 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.770
 I can not believe I can not believe that 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.200
 there is a game designer that does not have 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.090
 pleasure in your profession make a game 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.560
 that makes me happy and I always 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.300
 I thought you happy with what I 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 Do you do a day to day has no price? 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.470
 so I do not always tell people 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.110
 that when you do what you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.599
 like money is a result of this 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.980
 He ends up coming naturally. 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.040
 so I follow exactly the same 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.810
 family that accompanied me without 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.810
 hurry i never thought to do anything else
