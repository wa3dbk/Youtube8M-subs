00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello in this tutorial I will show you how 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 make this huge pencil with paper 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.810
 corrugated and in which you can save 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.810
 things 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:21.340
 the materials you will need are paper 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.760
 corrugated pink yellow corrugated paper 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.770
 silicon a piece of brown paperboard 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.250
 You can take it out of some cereal box 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.610
 this I had it from a box of cookies 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.730
 a rule scissors a black down that does not 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 be very thin and a pen or pencil 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.120
 something similar to draw 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.830
 first roll cartonboard with the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 part coffee out 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.140
 around everything and as forming a 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.300
 cone 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.260
 you must leave the lid free so that 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.110
 you can the icon without counting the top of the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.129
 down should measure between 10 and 15 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.129
 centimeters approximately 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 now one all with silicone add 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.200
 everything you can to make it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.780
 perfectly fixed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.450
 It also adds silicone at the tip of the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.200
 cone winter break and this is not us 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.200
 go out 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 this way you will stay 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.760
 then remember a rectangle of paper 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.540
 55 cm yellow corrugated 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.490
 long and 40 centimeters wide you owe 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.650
 fix on that the brave ones of paper 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.630
 corrugated are vertical direction 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.500
 your rectangle since this will give you the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.500
 pencil effect 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.700
 with silicon on the entire edge of the paper 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.229
 corrugated places the connection you made 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.229
 and they see it around like this 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.720
 adds a lot of silicon in the bit that 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.720
 it fits and closes the cylinder 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.810
 measures the diameter of the top of 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.090
 your pencil and draw on paper 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 pink corrugated a circle that has the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.560
 diameter of your pencil more medium 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.739
 centimeter for example the diameter of a 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.530
 pencil is 7.5 centimeters and then 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.530
 I drew a circle of 8 centimeters 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.319
 he also drew a typical 5 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.269
 centimeters wide and long what 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.269
 Measure the circumference of your circle 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.730
 at once he trims his figures 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.890
 now place silicone all over 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.550
 circle outline and paste the ink 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.550
 about this 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.940
 add a little more silicon to join 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.940
 both tips of the strips 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.980
 and we're done with the draft of our 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.980
 pencil 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.810
 now it only remains for you to fill the pencil 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.760
 with whatever it is that decides to save what 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.239
 good is that you can save it up to 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.239
 ruler 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.980
 and cover everything with the eraser 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.410
 our pencil is already finished with this 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.900
 huge pencil you can draw is a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.220
 little more complicated but it 's fun 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.220
 try it and you do not need a pencil sharpener 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.510
 can be a smaller one and use it as 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.819
 carry case at school 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.440
 well that was all for today I hope you 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.750
 have liked this craft for the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.450
 back to school and share the video if 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.670
 I liked you I challenge you to do this huge 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.459
 pencil and in the guardÃ©s of some sites 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.090
 school supplies or your tools to 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.090
 make crafts
