tease like this I have I kind of

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.850 
tease like this I have I kind of
gradually<00:02:18.010> got<00:02:18.459> myself<00:02:18.760> out<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.470> needing<00:02:20.470> to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
gradually got myself out of needing to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.180 
gradually got myself out of needing to
sweeten<00:02:21.520> um<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.989> I'm<00:02:23.410> pretty<00:02:23.620> fine<00:02:23.890> with<00:02:24.160> just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
sweeten um so I'm pretty fine with just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.000 
sweeten um so I'm pretty fine with just
drinking<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.940> tea<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.360> its<00:02:25.840> own<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.350> feel<00:02:26.890> like

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
drinking the tea on its own I feel like

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.500 
drinking the tea on its own I feel like
this<00:02:27.220> tea<00:02:27.400> has<00:02:27.430> like<00:02:27.850> sort<00:02:28.150> of<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.300> natural

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
this tea has like sort of a natural

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.800 
this tea has like sort of a natural
sweetness<00:02:29.230> um<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.730> does<00:02:30.910> not<00:02:31.060> necessarily

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
sweetness um so it does not necessarily

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.250 
sweetness um so it does not necessarily
need<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.440> be<00:02:32.650> sweetened<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.400> does<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.450> stevia

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
need to be sweetened it does have stevia

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.160 
need to be sweetened it does have stevia
in<00:02:35.500> there<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:36.790> could<00:02:37.269> have<00:02:37.510> helped<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
in there so that could have helped it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.030 
in there so that could have helped it
but<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.190> actually<00:02:39.310> really<00:02:39.790> good<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.780> not

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
but it's actually really good it's not

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.490 
but it's actually really good it's not
funky<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.220> any<00:02:42.400> type<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> way<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.959> got<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.350> in

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
funky in any type of way and I got it in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.380 
funky in any type of way and I got it in
a<00:02:44.530> form<00:02:44.920> where<00:02:45.370> you'll<00:02:45.790> have<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.209> use<00:02:46.360> a

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
a form where you'll have to use a

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.170 
a form where you'll have to use a
strainer<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.440> did<00:02:47.980> go<00:02:48.190> ahead<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.459> steep<00:02:49.000> my

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.309 
strainer so I did go ahead and steep my
water<00:02:49.450> then<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.140> let<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.980> sit<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.610> water<00:02:51.970> for

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
water then I let it sit in the water for

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
but for three to five minutes that's how

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.860 
but for three to five minutes that's how
long<00:02:56.980> they<00:02:57.160> recommend<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.330> steep
