still a little bit rusty but I don't
want<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.039> get<00:01:41.640> too<00:01:42.600> much<00:01:43.130> more<00:01:44.929> of<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.380> off<00:01:46.560> for

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
want to get too much more of it off for

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.740 
want to get too much more of it off for
fear<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.700> some<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> bluing<00:01:48.390> might<00:01:48.539> come

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
fear that some of the bluing might come

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
fear that some of the bluing might come
off<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.110> was<00:01:49.289> really<00:01:49.319> heavy<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:50.069> right<00:01:50.310> here

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
off it was really heavy out right here

burn<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.299> chrysanthemum<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.000> may

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
burn the chrysanthemum and I think I may

burn the chrysanthemum and I think I may
have<00:01:54.179> taken<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.810> bit<00:01:54.929> off<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.719> to

have taken a little bit off there but to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.600 
have taken a little bit off there but to
get<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.020> rest<00:01:58.319> off<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.860> leave<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.459> of

raceways of the bolt here steel wool
didn't<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.370> get<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.519> whole<00:02:44.790> lot<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
didn't really get a whole lot of that

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.539

out<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.870> got<00:02:46.230> most<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> surface<00:02:46.950> rust<00:02:47.310> off

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
out it got most of the surface rust off

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
just going to be gritty and nasty and be

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.470 
just going to be gritty and nasty and be
a<00:02:53.010> pain<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.459> ass<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.120> get<00:02:54.239> out<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:57.120> the

a pain in the ass to get out of the

a pain in the ass to get out of the
receiver<00:02:57.840> area<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.709> get<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.220> there<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.400 
receiver area if I get it in there the
one<00:03:07.889> thing<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.269> was<00:03:09.480> also<00:03:09.660> worried<00:03:10.200> about

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
one thing that I was also worried about

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.059 
one thing that I was also worried about
was<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.829> bore<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:15.840> still<00:03:16.260> slightly

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
was the bore and it's still slightly

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.230 
was the bore and it's still slightly
worrisome<00:03:18.169> but

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:35.610 

it<00:03:25.240> did<00:03:25.510> clean<00:03:25.840> up<00:03:26.459> pretty<00:03:27.459> good<00:03:34.410> lands<00:03:35.410> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
it did clean up pretty good lands and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.930 
it did clean up pretty good lands and
grooves<00:03:35.680> aren't<00:03:36.040> as<00:03:36.130> sharp<00:03:36.220> as<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.760> would<00:03:36.880> have

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
grooves aren't as sharp as I would have

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.150 
grooves aren't as sharp as I would have
hoped<00:03:37.030> they<00:03:37.360> would<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:40.739> was<00:03:41.739> surprised

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
hoped they would be but I was surprised

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.860 
hoped they would be but I was surprised
at<00:03:42.340> how<00:03:42.459> well<00:03:42.489> didn't<00:03:42.940> clean<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.239> considering

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
at how well didn't clean up considering

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.630 
at how well didn't clean up considering
how<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.680> was<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.100> I<00:03:45.160> should<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.430> tried<00:03:45.580> to

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
how it was and I should have tried to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.210 
how it was and I should have tried to
get<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.850> bore<00:03:46.120> shot<00:03:46.390> before<00:03:46.600> but<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.440> just<00:03:48.069> don't

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
get a bore shot before but I just don't

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.890 
get a bore shot before but I just don't
know<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.610> would<00:03:49.239> have<00:03:49.330> been<00:03:49.450> able<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.750> see

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
know what would have been able to see

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.930 
know what would have been able to see
anything<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.440> was<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:50.830> dirty<00:03:51.130> there's<00:03:51.819> a

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
anything it was just so dirty there's a

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.220 
anything it was just so dirty there's a
little<00:03:52.180> bit<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.420> pitting<00:03:52.599> here<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.050> there

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
little bit of pitting here and there

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:03.059 
little bit of pitting here and there
which<00:03:54.130> isn't<00:03:54.310> surprising<00:03:54.550> at<00:03:55.090> all<00:03:56.459> as<00:04:01.799> as<00:04:02.799> it's

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
which isn't surprising at all as as it's

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.130 
which isn't surprising at all as as it's
been<00:04:03.220> speculated<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.569> probably<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.959> later

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
been speculated this is probably a later

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.690 
been speculated this is probably a later
30s<00:04:05.650> rifle<00:04:06.069> so<00:04:07.560> if<00:04:08.560> anybody<00:04:09.040> does<00:04:09.250> know<00:04:09.430> for

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
30s rifle so if anybody does know for

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.390 
30s rifle so if anybody does know for
sure<00:04:09.840> still<00:04:10.840> interested<00:04:11.319> in<00:04:11.440> knowing<00:04:11.590> how<00:04:12.340> you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
sure still interested in knowing how you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.449 
sure still interested in knowing how you
can<00:04:12.610> determine<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:13.060> exact<00:04:13.390> date<00:04:13.630> but<00:04:14.459> this

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
can determine the exact date but this

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.159 
can determine the exact date but this
here<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> little<00:04:16.000> bore<00:04:16.780> light<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.139> just

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
here is a little bore light it just

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.199 
here is a little bore light it just
collects<00:04:17.590> light<00:04:17.889> through<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.700> backside<00:04:19.150> of

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
collects light through the backside of

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.610 
collects light through the backside of
it<00:04:19.389> there<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:21.930> projects<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.050> down<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.350> barrel

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
it there and projects it down the barrel

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.060 
it there and projects it down the barrel
which<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> neat<00:04:24.610> little<00:04:24.639> tool<00:04:26.070> hands-free

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
which is a neat little tool hands-free

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.000 
which is a neat little tool hands-free
one<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:29.910> I'll<00:04:30.910> put<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.840> third<00:04:32.229> part<00:04:32.500> up<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.800> guess

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
one so I'll put a third part up I guess

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.290

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
I should say so still got a little ways

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.130 
I should say so still got a little ways
to<00:05:14.140> go<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:14.710> don't<00:05:14.979> know<00:05:15.250> if<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:16.300> Barrel<00:05:16.930> band

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
to go I don't know if this Barrel band

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.140 
to go I don't know if this Barrel band
is<00:05:17.320> really<00:05:17.470> salvageable<00:05:18.160> as<00:05:18.460> far<00:05:18.669> as<00:05:18.789> bluing

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
is really salvageable as far as bluing

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.260 
is really salvageable as far as bluing
instance<00:05:19.510> it's<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:20.050> rusted<00:05:20.560> but<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:22.000> front

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
instance it's just rusted but the front

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.700 
instance it's just rusted but the front
one<00:05:22.450> wasn't<00:05:22.690> too<00:05:22.870> bad<00:05:24.270> not<00:05:25.270> too<00:05:25.570> bad<00:05:25.600> at<00:05:25.990> all<00:05:26.110> so
