00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
another star made logic tutorial this

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.009 
another star made logic tutorial this
one<00:00:07.919> comes<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:08.340> Argo<00:00:08.940> cantar<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> forums

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
one comes from Argo cantar in the forums

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.039 
one comes from Argo cantar in the forums
asking<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> door<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:12.269> opens<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
asking about a door that opens and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.839 
asking about a door that opens and
closes<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.769> animation<00:00:14.370> playing<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
closes with the animation playing the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.269 
closes with the animation playing the
correct<00:00:15.210> way<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.809> if<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:17.010> which

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
correct way so if it was at all which

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
correct way so if it was at all which
was<00:00:17.490> opening<00:00:17.850> from<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> sides<00:00:18.449> then<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.720> would

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
was opening from the sides then it would

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.310 
was opening from the sides then it would
start<00:00:19.170> from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> sides<00:00:20.359> to<00:00:21.359> close<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.140> then

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
start from the sides to close and then

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
start from the sides to close and then
it<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.560> start<00:00:22.859> from<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.160> middle<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.820> open

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it would start from the middle to open

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820 
it would start from the middle to open
again<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.779> looked<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:25.680> was

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
again so it looked like it actually was

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.730 
again so it looked like it actually was
working<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.789> way<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> should<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.960> let's<00:00:28.410> go

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
working the way it should be so let's go

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
working the way it should be so let's go
ahead<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.130> build<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.519> I've<00:00:29.760> got<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> generic

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
ahead and build this I've got a generic

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
ahead and build this I've got a generic
door<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.830> I'm<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
door here and what I'm going to do is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.420 
door here and what I'm going to do is
just<00:00:32.669> throw<00:00:32.820> down<00:00:33.059> an<00:00:33.239> activation<00:00:33.630> module

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
just throw down an activation module

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
just throw down an activation module
that<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:36.000> use<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.510> select<00:00:37.350> everything

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that I can then use to select everything

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
that I can then use to select everything
else<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> happen<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.750> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
else that's going to happen what I do is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.569 
else that's going to happen what I do is
I've<00:00:40.290> got<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> little<00:00:40.739> spot<00:00:40.950> under<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
I've got a little spot under here and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
I've got a little spot under here and
I'll<00:00:42.149> put<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> into<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.370> activation<00:00:44.370> module<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I'll put it into a activation module and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.840 
I'll put it into a activation module and
a<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.350> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.559> gonna<00:00:46.739> control<00:00:47.280> our<00:00:47.579> two

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
a not so this is gonna control our two

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.350 
a not so this is gonna control our two
states<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.340> them<00:00:50.550> will<00:00:50.700> open<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> door

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
states so one of them will open the door

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.170 
states so one of them will open the door
and<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:51.989> will<00:00:52.140> close<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.800> door<00:00:53.180> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and one of them will close the door and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000 
and one of them will close the door and
we<00:00:54.390> leave<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> space<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> middle<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.829> case

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
we leave a space in the middle in case

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
we leave a space in the middle in case
we<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.370> invert<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.760> signal<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> then

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we want to invert that signal and then

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
we want to invert that signal and then
what<00:00:59.100> we<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.850> we're<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> grab<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
what we can do is we're going to grab a

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.640 
what we can do is we're going to grab a
bunch<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.829> gates<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.850> say<00:01:03.690> our<00:01:04.019> animation

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
bunch of or gates and say our animation

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.399 
bunch of or gates and say our animation
is<00:01:04.799> five<00:01:05.129> frames<00:01:05.640> long<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.720> we'll<00:01:06.900> put<00:01:07.110> five

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
is five frames long then we'll put five

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.920 
is five frames long then we'll put five
out<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.970> have<00:01:08.970> been<00:01:09.000> grabbing<00:01:09.510> each<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
out I have been grabbing each one of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
out I have been grabbing each one of
these<00:01:10.049> we'll<00:01:10.409> start<00:01:10.740> doing<00:01:10.920> our<00:01:11.159> actual

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
these we'll start doing our actual

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.980 
these we'll start doing our actual
animation<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.710> what<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> might<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:16.009> set<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
animation so what I might do is set the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.969 
animation so what I might do is set the
pain<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.729> think<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.150> middle<00:01:23.090> yep

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
pain I think that's in the middle yep

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.999 
pain I think that's in the middle yep
and<00:01:25.979> start<00:01:26.820> doing<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> animation<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and start doing the animation so what I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.700 
and start doing the animation so what I
really<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:31.130> kind<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:34.400> claw

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
really want is I kind of want a claw

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
really want is I kind of want a claw
like<00:01:37.710> these<00:01:38.549> things<00:01:38.880> coming<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> sides

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
like these things coming out the sides

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.969 
like these things coming out the sides
and<00:01:40.909> as<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> animation<00:01:43.110> we'll<00:01:43.500> select

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and as we do the animation we'll select

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
and as we do the animation we'll select
them<00:01:44.310> all<00:01:44.490> alright<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.329> might<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
them all alright so that might be the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.260 
them all alright so that might be the
first<00:01:45.780> part<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:47.189> also<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> second

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
first part then also like the second

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.139 
first part then also like the second
door<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> I'll<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> continue<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.880> part

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
door and I'll go and continue that part

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:03.610 
door and I'll go and continue that part
of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> animation<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:53.520> so

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.980 

Rinne<00:02:04.620> this<00:02:04.830> one<00:02:06.680> like<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.990> close

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
Rinne this one like that and that close

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.770 
Rinne this one like that and that close
close<00:02:10.320> close<00:02:10.350> close<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.520> then<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.300> might<00:02:12.480> start

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
close close close and then I might start

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.460 
close close close and then I might start
the<00:02:12.960> second<00:02:13.320> half<00:02:13.350> in<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> back<00:02:14.370> here<00:02:15.470> just

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the second half in the back here just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.290 
the second half in the back here just
start<00:02:16.770> closing<00:02:17.100> as<00:02:17.430> well<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.880> case<00:02:21.120> be

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
start closing as well so in this case be

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.330 
start closing as well so in this case be
careful<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.440> want<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.830> accidentally

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
careful you don't want to accidentally

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.340 
careful you don't want to accidentally
select<00:02:23.850> pieces<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.450> you've<00:02:24.570> already<00:02:24.780> done

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.760 

all<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.670> beat<00:02:30.770> that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
all right there we go for that beat that

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:40.790 
all right there we go for that beat that
and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.400> more<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:33.690> done<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:40.320> you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
and then one more I was all done and you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.530 
and then one more I was all done and you
can<00:02:40.950> make<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.220> animation<00:02:41.730> as<00:02:41.910> long<00:02:42.209> or<00:02:42.480> as

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
can make your animation as long or as

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.390 
can make your animation as long or as
short<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.320> want<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:46.920> you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
short as you want it to be but if you

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.160 
short as you want it to be but if you
have<00:02:47.550> pre-existing<00:02:47.790> doors<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.720> might<00:02:48.959> need

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
have pre-existing doors you might need

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.840 
have pre-existing doors you might need
to<00:02:49.320> recreate<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.920> again<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.459> want<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> do

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
to recreate them again if you want to do

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.570 
to recreate them again if you want to do
it<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.870> manner<00:02:55.520> fill<00:02:56.520> in<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> back<00:02:58.580> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
it in this manner fill in the back and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.280 
it in this manner fill in the back and
done<00:03:02.600> okay<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.820> there's<00:03:06.000> our<00:03:06.150> door<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:07.170> all

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
done okay so there's our door it's all

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.400 
done okay so there's our door it's all
closed<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.769> now<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.180> what<00:03:09.959> can<00:03:10.110> we<00:03:10.260> then<00:03:10.709> do<00:03:11.040> is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
closed up now and what can we then do is

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.270 
closed up now and what can we then do is
turn<00:03:13.410> off<00:03:13.470> our<00:03:13.739> mirroring<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:16.220> count<00:03:17.220> how

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
turn off our mirroring and count how

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.340 
turn off our mirroring and count how
many<00:03:17.400> over<00:03:17.730> many<00:03:18.000> frames<00:03:18.299> we<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.720> then<00:03:19.200> we're

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
many over many frames we have then we're

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.100 
many over many frames we have then we're
gonna<00:03:19.500> do<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.860> many<00:03:20.130> delays<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.330> each<00:03:21.480> side<00:03:21.750> 3

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
gonna do that many delays on each side 3

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:31.520 
gonna do that many delays on each side 3
4<00:03:22.440> 5<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.970> then<00:03:25.190> 1<00:03:26.190> 2<00:03:26.549> 3<00:03:27.080> 4<00:03:28.080> 5<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.750> also<00:03:31.200> what<00:03:31.410> we

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
4 5 and then 1 2 3 4 5 and also what we

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.920 
4 5 and then 1 2 3 4 5 and also what we
want<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.769> note<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.190> where<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.880> star<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.299> which

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
want to note is where the star is which

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.259 
want to note is where the star is which
is<00:03:34.110> on<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.380> side<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.920> always<00:03:35.730> go<00:03:35.940> left<00:03:36.180> to

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
is on this side I always go left to

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.630 
is on this side I always go left to
right<00:03:36.299> it's<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.989> easier<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.290> remember<00:03:37.640> now

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
right it's just easier to remember now

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.039 
right it's just easier to remember now
with<00:03:38.850> each<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.150> these<00:03:39.239> we're<00:03:39.570> going<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:39.930> an

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
with each of these we're going to do an

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.840 
with each of these we're going to do an
end<00:03:40.260> gate<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:41.190> each<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.739> cable<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.370> each

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
end gate for each and cable for each

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.500 
end gate for each and cable for each
there<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:46.130> then<00:03:47.130> on<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.579> side<00:03:47.880> which<00:03:48.180> has<00:03:48.390> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
there and then on the side which has the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.990 
there and then on the side which has the
activation<00:03:49.320> block<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:50.579> want<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.790> check

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
activation block we want to check

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.690 
activation block we want to check
another<00:03:51.209> not<00:03:51.570> gate<00:03:51.900> all<00:03:52.739> right<00:03:52.950> now<00:03:53.190> just<00:03:53.549> to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
another not gate all right now just to

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.100 
another not gate all right now just to
link<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.209> up

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
link all this up

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.130 
link all this up
select<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> activation<00:03:56.430> block<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.810> we'll

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
select the activation block and we'll

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.620 
select the activation block and we'll
put<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.410> into<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.709> not<00:03:58.860> gate<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.340> then<00:04:00.299> we'll

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
put it into the not gate and then we'll

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.890 
put it into the not gate and then we'll
put<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.959> into<00:04:01.440> each<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.370> these<00:04:02.579> and<00:04:02.970> gates<00:04:04.489> and

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
put it into each of these and gates and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.320 
put it into each of these and gates and
then<00:04:06.900> select<00:04:07.230> they're<00:04:07.410> not

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
then select they're not

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.980 
then select they're not
and<00:04:08.420> put<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.870> into<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.230> first<00:04:09.500> delay<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.990> then

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
and put it into the first delay and then

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.320 
and put it into the first delay and then
that<00:04:12.710> will<00:04:12.920> go<00:04:13.070> into<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.610> next<00:04:13.760> delay<00:04:14.120> that

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
that will go into the next delay that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.420 
that will go into the next delay that
I'll<00:04:14.450> go<00:04:14.600> into<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.900> next<00:04:15.080> delay<00:04:15.410> someone<00:04:16.280> and

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
I'll go into the next delay someone and

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.420 
I'll go into the next delay someone and
so<00:04:16.580> forth<00:04:16.820> like<00:04:17.030> that<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:18.190> then<00:04:19.190> each<00:04:19.400> of

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
so forth like that and then each of

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.300 
so forth like that and then each of
these<00:04:19.730> delay<00:04:20.239> blocks<00:04:20.540> will<00:04:20.780> then<00:04:20.959> select<00:04:21.310> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
these delay blocks will then select to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.080 
these delay blocks will then select to
go<00:04:22.460> into<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.210> gate<00:04:23.510> that's<00:04:23.750> next<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.380> them

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
go into the and gate that's next to them

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.120 
go into the and gate that's next to them
and<00:04:26.090> that's<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.480> for<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.780> side<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.770> sides<00:04:28.040> a

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
and that's it for that side this sides a

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.240 
and that's it for that side this sides a
little<00:04:28.430> bit<00:04:28.610> simpler<00:04:29.500> this<00:04:30.500> not<00:04:30.740> gate<00:04:30.950> goes

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
little bit simpler this not gate goes

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.930 
little bit simpler this not gate goes
into<00:04:31.670> each<00:04:31.940> of<00:04:32.120> these<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:33.520> then<00:04:34.520> goes<00:04:34.700> into

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
into each of these and then goes into

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.420 
into each of these and then goes into
the<00:04:35.180> end<00:04:35.360> one<00:04:35.600> again<00:04:36.010> delay<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.400> delay

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
the end one again delay and the delay

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.180 
the end one again delay and the delay
just<00:04:38.000> loops<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.530> down<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.710> line<00:04:39.920> like<00:04:39.950> that

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
just loops in down the line like that

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.130 
just loops in down the line like that
and<00:04:40.400> then<00:04:40.760> each<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:40.970> those<00:04:41.240> goes<00:04:41.510> into<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> NAND

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
and then each of those goes into a NAND

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.650 
and then each of those goes into a NAND
gate<00:04:42.230> as<00:04:42.620> well<00:04:43.150> like<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.030> we<00:04:47.150> step<00:04:47.420> back

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
gate as well like so so if we step back

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.010 
gate as well like so so if we step back
a<00:04:47.690> bit

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
a bit

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.060 
a bit
and<00:04:48.260> we<00:04:48.350> hit<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.710> button<00:04:49.030> you'll<00:04:50.030> see<00:04:50.920> we<00:04:51.920> need

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
and we hit the button you'll see we need

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.800 
and we hit the button you'll see we need
to<00:04:52.190> toggle<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.610> for<00:04:53.120> things<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.540> style

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
to toggle it for things to style

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.680 
to toggle it for things to style
anything<00:04:54.110> up<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.030> can<00:04:56.180> see<00:04:56.390> there<00:04:56.660> that

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
anything up and you can see there that

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.590 
anything up and you can see there that
that's<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.560> closing<00:04:58.010> animation<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.790> that's

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
that's the closing animation and that's

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.810 
that's the closing animation and that's
the<00:04:59.690> opening<00:04:59.990> animation<00:05:00.590> there<00:05:00.920> so<00:05:01.520> blue

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
the opening animation there so blue

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.900 
the opening animation there so blue
going<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.240> orange<00:05:02.600> will<00:05:02.900> be<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.110> opening<00:05:03.470> and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
going to orange will be the opening and

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:12.940 
going to orange will be the opening and
orange<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.060> blue<00:05:05.390> is<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.470> closing<00:05:11.560> okay<00:05:12.560> and

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
orange to blue is the closing okay and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.710 
orange to blue is the closing okay and
when<00:05:13.190> we're<00:05:13.340> opening<00:05:13.880> we<00:05:14.060> want<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.330> do<00:05:14.450> the

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
when we're opening we want to do the

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.940 
when we're opening we want to do the
reverse<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:16.669> closing<00:05:17.500> so<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.620> can<00:05:18.770> see

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
reverse of the closing so you can see

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.150 
reverse of the closing so you can see
there's<00:05:19.190> a<00:05:19.310> closing<00:05:19.730> there<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:21.740> what<00:05:21.890> we<00:05:21.980> can

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
there's a closing there so what we can

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.909 
there's a closing there so what we can
do<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.460> we<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.730> hook<00:05:22.910> up<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.210> clothing<00:05:24.080> first

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
do is we can hook up the clothing first

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.600 
do is we can hook up the clothing first
and<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:26.120> just<00:05:26.360> goes<00:05:26.590> select<00:05:27.590> one<00:05:27.800> goes<00:05:28.250> into<00:05:28.460> an

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
and it just goes select one goes into an

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.310 
and it just goes select one goes into an
or<00:05:28.790> block<00:05:29.120> like<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:31.870> like<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:34.400> one<00:05:34.700> more

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
or block like so like that and one more

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:42.720 
or block like so like that and one more
and<00:05:36.320> then<00:05:36.410> these<00:05:36.620> go<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.340> opposite<00:05:38.300> way

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.920 

because<00:05:43.730> we<00:05:43.850> want<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.090> plane<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.330> opposite<00:05:46.930> so

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
because we want to plane the opposite so

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.709 
because we want to plane the opposite so
we<00:05:48.050> kind<00:05:48.260> of

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
we kind of

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:51.709 
we kind of
like<00:05:48.959> that<00:05:49.199> and<00:05:49.739> we're<00:05:50.219> done<00:05:50.449> so<00:05:51.449> we<00:05:51.509> should

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
like that and we're done so we should

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.769 
like that and we're done so we should
see<00:05:51.929> now<00:05:52.819> there's<00:05:53.819> the<00:05:53.909> animation<00:05:54.419> for<00:05:54.599> it<00:05:54.689> to

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
see now there's the animation for it to

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.129 
see now there's the animation for it to
close<00:05:55.759> we<00:05:56.759> hit<00:05:56.939> it<00:05:57.059> and<00:05:57.209> as<00:05:57.389> the<00:05:57.509> animation<00:05:57.869> for

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
close we hit it and as the animation for

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:04.039 
close we hit it and as the animation for
it<00:05:58.259> to<00:05:58.349> open<00:06:01.909> so<00:06:02.909> that's<00:06:03.029> really<00:06:03.299> that's<00:06:03.689> all

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:04.049 
it to open so that's really that's all

00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:06.439 
it to open so that's really that's all
that<00:06:04.469> is<00:06:04.679> to<00:06:05.069> it<00:06:05.219> and<00:06:05.429> you<00:06:05.939> can<00:06:06.089> do<00:06:06.179> as<00:06:06.299> many

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
that is to it and you can do as many

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.350 
that is to it and you can do as many
complicated<00:06:07.229> animations<00:06:08.069> as<00:06:08.279> you<00:06:08.459> want<00:06:08.729> you

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
complicated animations as you want you

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.319 
complicated animations as you want you
can<00:06:09.509> also<00:06:09.659> link<00:06:10.079> up<00:06:10.289> other<00:06:10.949> key<00:06:11.879> things<00:06:12.209> to

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:12.329 
can also link up other key things to

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:15.589 
can also link up other key things to
these<00:06:13.039> ball<00:06:14.039> blocks<00:06:14.429> as<00:06:14.729> well<00:06:14.759> if<00:06:15.239> you<00:06:15.360> wanted

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
these ball blocks as well if you wanted

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.449 
these ball blocks as well if you wanted
lights<00:06:15.869> or<00:06:16.139> stuff<00:06:16.349> to<00:06:16.499> start<00:06:16.739> lighting<00:06:17.009> up<00:06:17.279> as

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:17.459 
lights or stuff to start lighting up as

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:20.649 
lights or stuff to start lighting up as
it<00:06:18.029> was<00:06:18.089> opening<00:06:18.299> up<00:06:18.719> you<00:06:19.379> can<00:06:19.559> easily<00:06:19.739> do<00:06:20.099> that

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
it was opening up you can easily do that

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.749 
it was opening up you can easily do that
but<00:06:21.659> for<00:06:21.959> now<00:06:22.110> my<00:06:22.469> name<00:06:22.649> is<00:06:22.800> bench<00:06:23.009> until<00:06:23.339> next

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
but for now my name is bench until next

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.989 
but for now my name is bench until next
time<00:06:24.029> keep<00:06:24.689> playing
