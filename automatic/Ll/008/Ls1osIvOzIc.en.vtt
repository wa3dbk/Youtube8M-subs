00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
does it have to be so much I normally

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.310 
does it have to be so much I normally
get<00:00:38.930> him<00:00:39.079> for<00:00:39.199> like<00:00:39.289> a<00:00:39.320> good<00:00:39.620> price<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.399> I<00:00:41.359> got

get him for like a good price and I got

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.000 
get him for like a good price and I got
it<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.710> about<00:00:43.010> buying<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:43.609> for<00:00:43.760> 15<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:45.010> I

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
it and about buying it for 15 and I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.799 
it and about buying it for 15 and I
thought<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:46.850> was<00:00:46.910> gonna<00:00:47.059> be<00:00:47.149> worth<00:00:47.329> more<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.719> I

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
thought it was gonna be worth more and I

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.119 
thought it was gonna be worth more and I
think<00:00:48.109> it's<00:00:48.260> going<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.559> end<00:00:48.649> up<00:00:48.710> selling<00:00:48.980> for

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
think it's going to end up selling for

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.150 
think it's going to end up selling for
but<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:49.969> paid<00:00:50.239> 15<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.260> think<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.739> could<00:00:52.010> get

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
but I paid 15 and I think I could get

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.040 
but I paid 15 and I think I could get
like<00:00:52.600> $40<00:00:53.600> tops<00:00:53.989> for<00:00:54.410> it<00:00:54.559> probably<00:00:55.899> kind<00:00:56.899> of

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
like $40 tops for it probably kind of

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.739 
like $40 tops for it probably kind of
disappointing<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.710> mean<00:00:57.829> if<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:58.249> can<00:00:58.399> get<00:00:58.550> 40<00:00:58.910> so

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
disappointing I mean if I can get 40 so

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.470

thing<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.620> just<00:01:36.800> picked<00:01:36.950> up<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.160> racket<00:01:37.370> just

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
thing I just picked up a racket just

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.010 
thing I just picked up a racket just
because<00:01:38.060> I've<00:01:38.180> been<00:01:38.300> looking<00:01:38.450> at<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:38.750> seeing

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
because I've been looking at but seeing

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.130 
because I've been looking at but seeing
how<00:01:39.110> much<00:01:39.200> tennis<00:01:39.590> rackets<00:01:39.950> are<00:01:40.870> recently<00:01:41.870> and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
how much tennis rackets are recently and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.930 
how much tennis rackets are recently and
they're<00:01:43.010> they're<00:01:43.400> pretty<00:01:43.430> expensive

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
they're they're pretty expensive

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.200 
they're they're pretty expensive
especially<00:01:44.510> for<00:01:45.170> prints<00:01:46.130> rackets<00:01:46.640> or<00:01:46.790> head

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
especially for prints rackets or head

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.090 
especially for prints rackets or head
racquets<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.520> this<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:49.730> actually<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.480> youth

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
racquets and this is actually a youth

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.470 
racquets and this is actually a youth
youth<00:01:52.100> bracket<00:01:52.780> um<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:54.140> think<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:55.480> will

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
youth bracket um I think it will

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.630 
youth bracket um I think it will
probably<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:57.530> sell<00:01:57.830> as<00:01:57.980> easily<00:01:58.280> but<00:01:58.940> still

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
probably not sell as easily but still

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.720 
probably not sell as easily but still
it's<00:02:01.640> a<00:02:01.700> weird<00:02:01.940> size<00:02:02.210> three<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.140> five-eighths

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
it's a weird size three and five-eighths

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.390 
it's a weird size three and five-eighths
all<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:04.850> ones<00:02:05.000> I've<00:02:05.120> seen<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.330> 3<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:05.720> 3/4<00:02:06.230> and<00:02:06.560> I

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
all the ones I've seen a 3 and 3/4 and I

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.350 
all the ones I've seen a 3 and 3/4 and I
think<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.179> could<00:02:08.360> sell<00:02:08.569> it<00:02:08.720> for<00:02:08.750> like<00:02:09.849> $20<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.150> I

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
think I could sell it for like $20 and I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.220 
think I could sell it for like $20 and I
paid<00:02:11.750> $3<00:02:12.710> for<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:14.390> again<00:02:14.480> that's<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.960> lot<00:02:15.200> of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
paid $3 for it but again that's a lot of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.050 
paid $3 for it but again that's a lot of
shipping

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
shipping

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.750
