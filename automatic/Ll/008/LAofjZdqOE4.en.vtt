00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.109
 unfortunately it occurred to me to do 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:09.780
 until now this video is a sample 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 of my pedals to measure what I'm 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.910
 occupying and therefore good unfortunately 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 because I'm a little bit ahead but 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
 I was previously using this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.680
 which is a pedal train a pt 1 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.970
 real train and previously so good 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.510
 that was my name is and tone 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.260
 stickers 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.870
 psycho monkey great sponsor of his 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.890
 excellent server t- shirts the best 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.470
 shirts that you can find in the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 market and 100% focused music of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.270
 musicians for musicians then good to offend 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.870
 which is the mark of the champions in 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 against guitars 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.640
 and well, this is the pt some cables 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.170
 that is occupying offending in defending 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 down here I have another cable defend the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.190
 which is for the broad some bits 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.019
 I have left over and well, this is a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.880
 barbarian project which I am putting together and 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.680
 which I went to do 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.280
 thanks to my vintage friends with the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.040
 which make preciousness is a 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.110
 Tassel pedal which is completely made to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.210
 my specifications to my 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.420
 requirements from the perforations 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:27.240
 the size lights 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.760
 they personalized to my name and it is not 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.980
 Incredible incredible really well 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.210
 as you are seeing there is going to be 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.330
 there, little by little, I finish 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.550
 hit raul and is the world cup of gua is 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.140
 a cry baby at a while can be another video 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.150
 where I'm going to show you how the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.370
 chain where it enters by in salem that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.730
 pedal goes first which to me to me in what 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.660
 This one works very well for me 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.160
 and which I have been testing for years 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.170
 changing bits as they enter as 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.050
 they leave even watching videos on youtube 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.180
 is checking with several large ones 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 guitarists, well, they have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.290
 advised and I've taken the best 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.900
 advice and especially as to me 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.640
 it works to accommodate these pedals but 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.040
 well I tell you a little about this part 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.160
 from the board here is an entrance to which 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.959
 I asked not I'm occupying but I asked 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.850
 because with this technology never 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.260
 you know when yes when not but everything 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.360
 enter here through this module this 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.270
 wireless on this side I have two 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.310
 outputs goes stereo 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.610
 from left to right here is the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.740
 general power input and this 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.960
 is the switch which activates and deactivates 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.680
 the LEDs when the cable is connected and 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.050
 connect to the light and I always have light 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.400
 for my pedals down very heron 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.280
 pretty is very aesthetic it 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.060
 I highly recommend this one I do not know if it 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.440
 reach to see here here goes the 1 spot that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 is the one I'm occupying to increase 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.080
 my pedals 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.050
 they work with pure neutrino cables what 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.910
 which made me excellent 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.080
 and here are the two output I have one 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.450
 I was watching how it was done because 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.500
 I need another longer time already 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.500
 I comment why and for what 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.090
 I'm good I have a break here I'm 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.500
 testing each pedal to something else is equal 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.680
 the first time I work with the cow 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.050
 bless I ventured I took a chance and really 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.490
 It's making me very practical 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.160
 father the way of working of these 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.840
 cables which is the one you order 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.030
 I asked pepe rocha directly from 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.620
 monterrey I send a greeting this bus 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.530
 that the excellent seller effect 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.989
 can get what they want this and 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.700
 well, he sings with youtube me 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.580
 I walked through the lava was among the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.489
 lava and the george george are a 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.269
 little bit more expensive this and good lava 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.880
 the grip a good promotion with pepis 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.280
 and checking on youtube was coming 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.030
 mentalizado of how the city sea there 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.150
 to weld and there to not let go 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 for welding are five pieces five 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.600
 accessories with which you have to 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.970
 work to not let go there are three are 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:07.810
 three but I came across this one 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.060
 with which these others work with 2 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.800
 22 pieces is finished cutting the cable 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.710
 black 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.720
 he gets here he is given like vueltecitas 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.799
 in the middle brings there you get to see I think 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.400
 in as a hole which enters entrance 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.140
 it's no longer wires it's like metal what 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.590
 they have to go in there and can when the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:36.590
 land that rose this part this part 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.870
 and nothing else after this is placed 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.030
 part dates it spins and they are 22 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.440
 pieces nothing else really is very easy 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.970
 the first one cost me work because I did not 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.580
 it had been thought that he had missed 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.260
 pieces but it's not very easy very 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.110
 easy to put together then when you try the 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.430
 first cable and it's a cool how 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.090
 work I'm trying it on the table 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.590
 guitar is a peaceful east to east 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.470
 amplifier is many choruses already very well 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.810
 It is very very rattled but well 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.800
 I'm trying this 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.139
 and I was impressed with this until now 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.590
 because it's very long the cable is 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:16.430
 for 5 pedals this one brings 10 10 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.009
 angulated connectors plus guess is not 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.909
 a chulada I 'm going to enter 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.909
 the case 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.990
 the floorboard love is a chulada 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.960
 you can not see the light very well 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.280
 I have a relax here but good everything

 I'm over again 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:56.300
 the memory then to continue hurrying arrived 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.710
 to continue hurrying this to finish 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.280
 put together all this in the little time and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.480
