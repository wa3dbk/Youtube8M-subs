00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
greenhouse a little bit about this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.400 
greenhouse a little bit about this
section<00:00:18.330> here<00:00:21.289> as<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:24.019> this<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.230> not

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
section here as you can see this is not

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.769 
section here as you can see this is not
very<00:00:25.710> old<00:00:25.890> structure<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:28.019> new

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
very old structure not really new

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.530 
very old structure not really new
probably<00:00:30.779> 20<00:00:31.500> years<00:00:31.740> old<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> tomato

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
probably 20 years old so the tomato

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.110 
probably 20 years old so the tomato
would<00:00:33.840> grow<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.850> located<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
would grow here right located on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.160 
would grow here right located on the
floor<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:39.000> right<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.890> fly<00:00:40.890> sticks<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.610> cover

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
floor so right on fly sticks over cover

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.060 
mentioned before this is beefsteak
tomatoes<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:32.750> since<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> moment<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.470> planted

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
tomatoes and since the moment we planted

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.109 
tomatoes and since the moment we planted
this<00:01:35.880> plants<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> bag<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:38.119> what

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this plants in the bag here what

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.810 
this plants in the bag here what
happened<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> plants<00:01:41.909> were<00:01:42.030> growing<00:01:42.439> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
happened the plants were growing and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.640 
happened the plants were growing and
setting<00:01:44.820> fruits<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:46.759> clusters

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
setting fruits in clusters

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.360 
setting fruits in clusters
as<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.850> can<00:01:50.060> see<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:51.260> first<00:01:51.500> two<00:01:51.770> clusters

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
as you can see the first two clusters

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.280 
as you can see the first two clusters
will<00:01:52.790> left<00:01:53.110> five<00:01:54.110> fruits<00:01:54.650> on<00:01:55.610> each<00:01:55.790> cluster

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
will left five fruits on each cluster

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.050 
will left five fruits on each cluster
and<00:01:57.290> after<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:58.000> we<00:01:59.000> are<00:01:59.060> sitting<00:01:59.540> for<00:01:59.570> fruits

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
and after that we are sitting for fruits

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.950 
and after that we are sitting for fruits
so<00:02:02.060> with<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.420> light<00:02:02.630> levels<00:02:04.000> sometimes<00:02:05.000> plant

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
so with the light levels sometimes plant

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.080 
so with the light levels sometimes plant
cannot<00:02:06.440> make<00:02:06.680> four<00:02:07.930> sometimes<00:02:08.930> it's<00:02:09.229> three<00:02:10.090> so

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
cannot make four sometimes it's three so

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.920 
cannot make four sometimes it's three so
ideal<00:02:11.390> situation<00:02:12.370> when<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.490> plant<00:02:13.760> makes<00:02:14.090> for

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
ideal situation when the plant makes for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.300 
ideal situation when the plant makes for
nice<00:02:15.200> fruits<00:02:16.030> per<00:02:17.030> set

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
nice fruits per set

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.490 
nice fruits per set
see<00:02:19.310> that's<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.790> flower<00:02:20.090> with<00:02:20.840> young<00:02:21.140> fruits

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
see that's the flower with young fruits

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.670 
see that's the flower with young fruits
and<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.860> top

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.990 

so<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.549> moment<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:29.530> we<00:02:29.849> count<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:31.420> flowers

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
so this moment if we count this flowers

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.670 
so this moment if we count this flowers
nice<00:02:34.000> flowers<00:02:34.450> here<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.970> one<00:02:37.360> two<00:02:37.959> three

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
nice flowers here it's one two three

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
nice flowers here it's one two three
four<00:02:39.250> five<00:02:39.819> six<00:02:40.420> seven<00:02:41.049> eight<00:02:41.470> clusters

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
four five six seven eight clusters

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:52.270 
four five six seven eight clusters
counting<00:02:43.840> flowers<00:02:44.200> at<00:02:45.159> this<00:02:45.430> moment

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.270 

as<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.490> can<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:54.000> here<00:02:54.530> we'll<00:02:55.530> start<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:56.070> de

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
as you can see here we'll start to de

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.710 
as you can see here we'll start to de
leave<00:02:57.350> take<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.590> leaves<00:02:58.830> off<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.760> plant<00:03:00.090> old

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
leave take the leaves off the plant old

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.110 
leave take the leaves off the plant old
leaves<00:03:02.780> leaving<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.960> cluster<00:03:04.530> open<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:06.000> it

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
leaves leaving the cluster open so it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.290 
leaves leaving the cluster open so it
would<00:03:06.330> be<00:03:06.540> easy<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.290> peek<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.460> at<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> same

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
would be easy to peek and at the same

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.640 
would be easy to peek and at the same
time<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:10.770> old<00:03:11.390> leaves<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.840> take<00:03:13.080> any

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
time the old leaves don't take any

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.490 
time the old leaves don't take any
energy<00:03:14.520> from<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> plant

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.690 

see<00:03:21.920> here<00:03:22.190> more<00:03:22.430> fruits<00:03:24.160> let's<00:03:25.160> start<00:03:25.520> to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
see here more fruits let's start to

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:37.600 
see here more fruits let's start to
ripen<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:29.530> nice<00:03:30.530> tomato<00:03:30.800> here<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:37.100> somewhere<00:03:37.550> in
