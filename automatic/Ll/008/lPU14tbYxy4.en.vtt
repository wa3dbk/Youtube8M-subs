00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi all the guys are anxious from 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 wikileaks today I'm here with a new one 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.950
 digital video where the stereo like 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.929
 export vehicles to singles for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.880
 multiplayer and I want to immediately 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.009
 specify that game is not mine but it is 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.480
 registered by a friend that I recommend 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.010
 to visit his channel you will find it 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.240
 in description I greet again 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.650
 gameplay sports 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 I couldn't record the gameplay 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 because he had the ternet door 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.890
 burned or better or the door 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.689
 of the internet burned and for this 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.189
 precisely I was not able to perform 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.550
 this glitch because to do this 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.859
 click 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 the only requirement that you will need will be 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.059
 that of having an ethernet cable 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.700
 otherwise it will not work in any way 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.160
 or rather there are ways but even more 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 complicated already this glik is complicated 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 his and I believe this is the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.739
 most complicated glitch I ever have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 explained on youtube the glitch works 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 however both on xbox 360 and up 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.690
 playstation 3 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.059
 in the video anyway if you have 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 the interface of the playstation network is 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.440
 the enemy also has automatic access 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 and this is important he still had to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.400
 the procedure is always the same 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 as long as you follow the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.290
 commentaries and in any case you see more or less 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 the procedure that will be exactly the same 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.070
 in both consoles 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 you can also export all vehicles 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.509
 from the multiplayer single player however for 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.240
 some to put them in garages vi 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 will need the glitch on how to deposit 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.350
 luxury vehicles in the garage that would be 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.210
 the previous video 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
 let's start right away with the glitch for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 first thing you have to choose a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 rescue where you have a car that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.490
 you just want to export in multiplayer 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.890
 and when you chose that car 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 must bring a lease at will that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.479
 you will use for this here there is a 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.920
 once done, you have to save the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.960
 match in this case a single ha 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.500
 chosen santos customs but you can 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.720
 then choose any location 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 once you've done that go back up 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.710
 online and then go online and then 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.960
 an obsession and can go on session 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.850
 invitation only when you have uploaded the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.270
 session by invitation only you will have to go 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.130
 in the location of your save 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.469
 where there is a vehicle you want 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.849
 export in multiplayer in this case 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.530
 the only andrea near the tosca axis 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.020
 stone and then once this is done 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.630
 you have to go to the online options and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.010
 setting up 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.660
 the place of return to last position 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.140
 I recommend it is very important 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.750
 once that's done you have to get out of gta 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.490
 online via the character switch 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.250
 well anyway, just go out 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.160
 from gt online and when it will practically have 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 loaded the character animation 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.740
 you must return to the session only at 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.530
 invite and you don't have to upload the 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.480
 rescue then when in fact it will come 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 uploaded the country and you can click 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.590
 start will make you just click start on 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.980
 game 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.530
 you simply go on play trips 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.790
 online and then invitation-only session 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.460
 when you have loaded the session 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.440
 on the invitation you will be close to 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.000
 place where you set the last 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.150
 position must not necessarily be ii 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.110
 you will be around more or less precisely in 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.030
 that position 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.490
 here then it should practically 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.580
 press start and then go to game store 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.950
 xbox or replay store then press 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.630
 then press hicks and on the screen 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.340
 be careful after the screen 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.100
 of the attention of hicks and a second 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.010
 then you have to remove the ethernet cable e 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.600
 reconnect it immediately if you have 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.950
 automatic access to the playstation 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.990
 network 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.060
 this speech does not apply to those who alex 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.070
 box 60 or does not have access 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.080
 automatic playstation network vi 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.590
 will log in when you have done 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.900
 access 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.210
 just let us go out simply 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.790
 from the account just going suggestion 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.040
 account press triangle and then do 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.440
 come out but this is only true 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.240
 for those who have automatic access for whom 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.790
 does not have it does not matter then 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.670
 will basically give you all the screens 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.080
 of errors that then you are not practically 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.459
 connected to the playstation network and so on 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.770
 etc. and that's enough tct 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.500
 just click on all hicks 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.510
 those screens so once you get there 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.280
 will have loaded the single player and will have you 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.100
 precisely made to leave the session on 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.990
 place you have loaded the store you 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.110
 you will have to reload the save where 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:15.110
 you have the car in that place in 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.060
 which precisely you want to export the car 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.709
 when you have loaded the save 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.320
 access the playstation network 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.660
 or to xbox live and a friend anyway 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.880
 is at all access while loading the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.650
 game and all right you can 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.080
 precisely fire access mind loads the 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.790
 rescue doesn't matter when you 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.650
 you will have accessed then you must stay 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.150
 very very careful you have to keep 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.700
 pressed of the directional cross in 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.960
 down that you see three characters plus the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.360
 your character of the year you could 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.480
 choose character online in the 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.480
 screen and attention you have to be 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.419
 very careful then you have to practically 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.520
 press hicks and at the same time that 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.080
 press hicks you have to disconnect the cable 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.250
 ethernet 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.070
 once you have detached 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.570
 immediately attacked immediately and in 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.320
 meanwhile you will indeed attack the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.910
 ethernet cable 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.460
 it will happen that you will appear 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.290
 automatically the interface where you live 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.720
 from both the merkel has placed on playstation 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.240
 network or your various profiles on

 so done xbox live and if all 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.100
 will go correctly vicars shaking 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.690
 online 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.090
 in case you have access instead 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.140
 automatic as you see in the video of 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.030
 this friend of mine who did the 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.680
 gameplay that he has automatic access 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.210
 I give you all the talk from the beginning 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.500
 in the caution screen must 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.330
 press hicks and at the same time 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.880
 disconnect the ethernet cable then 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.440
 reattach it press the ps and 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.350
 you will notice that you will be logging on 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.690
 here you click on the writing that he saw 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.100
 access in progress and therefore will make you 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.620
 access in progress once you have 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.330
 Once logged in, press the ps and 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.460
 in fact it will load you gt line if you have 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.630
 correctly done this speech 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.340
 which he did now is only valid 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.810
 because all access smoked co 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.479
 if you don't have automatic login or 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.550
 you have the xbox 60 this speech is not valid 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.820
 but the previous speech is still valid 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.750
 or the fact in which it will appear to you 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.620
 the interface automatically etcetera 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.210
 etc 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.340
 if you did pitch properly 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.870
 precisely the car where you have will appear 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.440
 set the last position 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.090
 if you exported a dlc ad car 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.890
 example or a car that is worth anyway 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.340
 as much as the eudur the entity and so on 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.740
 etc 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.660
