00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
thought at the beginning I was very

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.020 
thought at the beginning I was very
artistic<00:00:10.110> because<00:00:10.530> she<00:00:10.740> was<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:12.000> minute

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
artistic because she was like one minute

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.880 
artistic because she was like one minute
she<00:00:12.509> was<00:00:12.690> like<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.920> know<00:00:14.299> like<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:16.170> stuck<00:00:16.740> with

the cadmium chick

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.240 
the cadmium chick
I<00:00:21.080> think<00:00:23.779> whatever<00:00:24.779> she<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
I think whatever she like I don't know I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.400 
I think whatever she like I don't know I
can't<00:00:26.609> really<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.390> don't<00:00:27.480> know<00:00:27.689> anyway<00:00:28.109> so
