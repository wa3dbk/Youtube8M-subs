texture packs and mods they will be used
they<00:02:10.519> will<00:02:10.750> they<00:02:11.750> will<00:02:11.780> come<00:02:12.079> into<00:02:12.200> play

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
they will they will come into play

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800 
they will they will come into play
however<00:02:13.190> they<00:02:13.820> will<00:02:13.970> not<00:02:14.120> be<00:02:14.239> straight<00:02:14.540> away

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
however they will not be straight away

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
however they will not be straight away
and<00:02:15.100> texture<00:02:16.100> packs<00:02:16.280> will<00:02:16.459> have<00:02:16.579> priority

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
and texture packs will have priority

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.000 
and texture packs will have priority
over<00:02:17.120> mods<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.079> think<00:02:18.470> there<00:02:18.650> might<00:02:18.829> be<00:02:18.890> a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
over mods and I think there might be a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.470 
over mods and I think there might be a
little<00:02:19.250> taste<00:02:19.489> amount<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.030> mods<00:02:20.239> they'll

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
little taste amount of mods they'll

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.420 
little taste amount of mods they'll
actually<00:02:20.660> be<00:02:20.840> yes<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.770> was<00:02:21.890> me<00:02:22.040> getting<00:02:22.220> a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
actually be yes that was me getting a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.380 
actually be yes that was me getting a
skype<00:02:22.640> message<00:02:22.790> not

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
skype message not

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.699 
skype message not
to<00:02:23.630> e<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.420> final<00:02:26.750> thing<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.410> launch

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
to e and the final thing is the launch

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.780 
to e and the final thing is the launch
date<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:30.100> basically<00:02:31.100> they<00:02:31.280> think<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.550> really

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
date so basically they think is really

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.910 
date so basically they think is really
be<00:02:31.880> out<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.330> 9th<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.750> May<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.500> pretty

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
be out on the 9th of May and pretty

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.230 
be out on the 9th of May and pretty
certain<00:02:34.160> they'll<00:02:34.490> be<00:02:34.580> able<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.760> stick<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.150> that

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
certain they'll be able to stick to that

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.430 
certain they'll be able to stick to that
normally<00:02:35.720> they're<00:02:35.840> pretty<00:02:36.020> good<00:02:36.200> on<00:02:36.290> their

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
normally they're pretty good on their

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.550 
normally they're pretty good on their
timings<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:38.080> think<00:02:39.080> that's<00:02:39.200> about<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.350> actually

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
timings I think that's about it actually

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.280 
timings I think that's about it actually
