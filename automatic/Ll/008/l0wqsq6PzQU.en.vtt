00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:09.799
 and you are more of meat or of 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.420
 fish the hobby consoles we were more than 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.190
 the first until just a few days ago 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.559
 Nintendo Europe invited us to try the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.180
 dish at its headquarters in germany as well 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.680
 that instead of frankfurter sausages 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.720
 we have brought you a calamari sandwich 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.580
 in your ink but before you start 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.410
 we want to dedicate this video advance to 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.199
 everyone who said that nintendo does not 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.119
 would develop a shooter or in painting 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.130
 Well, here you have it, it 's platoon 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.230
 first new ip Nintendo since 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.480
 14 years plus the first shooter 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.100
 multiplayer of its history but as not 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.170
 could be otherwise here not 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.090
 you will find headsets or mutilations nor 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.860
 massacres the closest thing to blood that 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.660
 you're going to see here are the jets of 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.490
 painting that will leave the famous dress 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 blue and black of the photo is like a 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.400
 jackson pollock box 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.490
 by the way you also see it black 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.710
 and white not good at what we're going 3 2 1 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.110
 the first thing we tried was the up 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.270
 now unknown individual campaign its 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.950
 development is purely platform and 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.140
 starts in a kind of square that we 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.090
 we can show similar in concept to the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.740
 of nintendo land from which we access 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.570
 to the different levels of the mode 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.820
 posed as a tutorial for 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.040
 familiarize yourself with the controls here 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.050
 we learn to jump shoot paint 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.030
 break boxes to collect eggs from 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.010
 fish or use secondary weapons like 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.870
 pyramidal grenades that serve to 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.150
 mislead the octo links troops with 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.310
 osse shield riot octopus 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.140
 let's go this way they turn to the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 side on which the bomb falls and they will leave 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.520
 the tentacle in the air to put it to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.620
 shot with forgiveness but the real key 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.470
 de es pla tuna is on the trigger 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.330
 it is not trigger not man this one help this 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.880
 is the cat that announces the team won 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.580
 in the online battles remove that and I 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.230
 I mean this to strike the zr trigger that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.120
 It serves to transform the protagonist 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.430
 in a squid to literally dive 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.160
 by the surfaces walls and ramps that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.510
 we have painted the variety of mechanics 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.460
 It has left us very satisfied 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.050
 culverts that expel columns of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.120
 painting by which to ascend to all 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.010
 speed pipes that transport us to 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.200
 other stage areas turrets for 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.830
 throw paint projectiles 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.170
 platforms that move through 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.300
 fans but our favorites are 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.100
 by far these sponges that 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.230
 They absorb our paint to grow in 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.150
 size or decrease when they receive the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.860
 painting of the enemy that if as a bob 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.630
 squid sponge see this level 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.670
 they claim copyright but already 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.830
 as you see the structure of the levels 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.600
 has remnants of super mario galaxy and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.190
 which are divided into sections on 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.900
 those that landed by super 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.330
 jumps that also work as check 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.980
 points a revealing proof that the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.500
 protagonist of the game was about to 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.000
 be mario despite its great variety and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.890
 frantic rhythm what has left us 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 somewhat faded is the short duration of 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.070
 these levels since they can be completed 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.410
 in about 5 minutes 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.750
 Another improvable aspect is the control of 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.610
 the camera by gyroscope aiming can 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.990
 be somewhat uncomfortable and it costs 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.700
 get the hang of it even though 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.900
 responsible for the game promise us that 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.600
 there will be an option to deactivate it and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.370
 replace it with the right stick as no 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.170
 comply they will be green and in the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.300
 analysis and we say it now because more 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.420
 get it once Colorado percent 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.420
 yellow 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.769
 where we got purple in the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.840
 multiplayer games the highlight of 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.400
 it is pla tuna an absolute waste of 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.230
 fun for eight players that 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.599
 merge the chaotic madness of mario kart 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.430
 8 with the fierce competitiveness of super 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.079
 smash bros the first way we play 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.430
 It was the so - called territorial where 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.379
 they face two teams of four 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.420
 players with the goal of covering 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.220
 painting plus percentage of the scenario that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.569
 the rival team without leaving a tile 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.400
 unpainted gray 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.620
 come on, there's no room here for 50 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.269
 shades of gray ni for one and it's worth in 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.069
 all kinds of tricks as tend 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.989
 ambushes consulting the map from the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.579
 gamepad or hide under the ink of 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.500
 our color to surface 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.299
 when they least expect it even though 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.120
 key to success is in weapons 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.370
 high schools 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.049
 when we load the acrylic meter that 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.879
 you see up to the right, it's enough 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.440
 press the right stick inwards 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.959
 to activate the special attack of each 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.390
 weapon and there are as brutal as unleashing 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.610
 a paint tornado or install a 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.200
 shower preventing passage to rival since 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.599
 the opposite color ink empty 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.310
 our deposit therefore choose 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.500
 each weapon potentiate and level up 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.329
 our character adds a point of 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.159
 strategy to the items that encourages 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.229
 teamwork for example while 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.510
 one focuses on painting another one covers 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.010
 with long- range weapons what yes 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.510
 we have noticed is a certain imbalance 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.280
 between the weapons 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.930
 the roller is fantastic to cover 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.300
 huge areas but weapons type 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.190
 shotgun take too long to load and 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.510
 they shoot little ink so that after 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.220
 try all the weapons at the end 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.750
 we resort to short pistols 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.810
 reach and to the roller is what better 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.810
 works 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.479
 to finish the evening we compete 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.460
 against a group of French journalists 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:47.039
 in a second multiplayer mode until 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.560
 now unpublished and if we avenge them 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.360
 for the 2006 World Cup it's about 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.919
 Mode paints areas of competitive combat 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.810
 a catch to the area that requires 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.030
 impregnate it with paint and endure 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.219
 100 seconds of our stopwatch before 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.259
 that the painted area is taken from us 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.300
 this mode has seemed even more 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.580
 intense and addictive that the territorial already 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.439
 that requires more communication and bad 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.569
 milk among the players 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.159
 in short if the online responds with 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.379
 the same fluidity as in this first 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.909
 contact we can dare to predict 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.800
 which is platoon will become the 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.930
 most fun multiplayer that has happened 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.310
 for a gamepad only surmountable by mario 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.529
 cartridge and super smash bros 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.539
 so whether it's meat or fish 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.490
 in just two months you can satisfy the 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.800
 hunger for shooters in wii and if you have 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.050
 our same appetite we advance you that 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.729
 you will want to repeat to know more 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.680
 details do not miss the written progress 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.449
 that I just I say in squid 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.210
 Inca lo mar in hobby puntocom consoles 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.319
 take advantage of advance warning no 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.319
 recommended for colorblind
