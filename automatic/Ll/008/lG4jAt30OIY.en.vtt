00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.589 
it's seven o'clock the van was shaking
all<00:02:24.890> right<00:02:25.040> under<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> wind<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.880> I<00:02:26.300> was<00:02:26.420> right

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
all right under the wind and I was right

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.500 
all right under the wind and I was right
about<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.020> awning<00:02:27.349> blown<00:02:27.680> away<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.270> just

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
about the awning blown away so I just

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.260 
about the awning blown away so I just

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
thought bugger it something new plugs in

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.150 
thought bugger it something new plugs in
and<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:33.050> will<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.319> will<00:02:33.500> be<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.830> morning

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
so here we are at the end of the day on

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.459 
so here we are at the end of the day on
Saturday<00:04:04.209> I've<00:04:04.420> decided<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.989> get<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.139> B&amp;B

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:05.469 
Saturday I've decided to get a B&amp;B

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.140 
Saturday I've decided to get a B&amp;B
because<00:04:05.829> the<00:04:06.040> van<00:04:06.189> was<00:04:06.340> too<00:04:06.519> cold<00:04:06.730> last<00:04:06.999> night

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
because the van was too cold last night

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.940 
because the van was too cold last night
and<00:04:07.450> it's<00:04:07.569> been<00:04:07.749> a<00:04:07.780> really<00:04:08.139> really<00:04:08.469> crappy<00:04:08.829> day

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
and it's been a really really crappy day

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.250 
and it's been a really really crappy day
really<00:04:09.430> didn't<00:04:10.269> go<00:04:10.359> out<00:04:10.480> qualify<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.230> I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
really didn't go out qualify so I

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.629 
really didn't go out qualify so I
thought<00:04:11.409> the<00:04:11.530> conditions<00:04:11.950> were<00:04:12.040> too<00:04:12.219> bad<00:04:12.430> it

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
thought the conditions were too bad it

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.949 
thought the conditions were too bad it
was<00:04:12.730> snowing<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.329> chat<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.719> which<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.930> was

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.229 
minus 3 and it was wet but the meeting
continued<00:04:17.829> so<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.370> decided<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.880> do<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.060> race

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239
