00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
going to make it really really easy to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.899 
going to make it really really easy to
get<00:01:51.270> great<00:01:51.509> pictures<00:01:51.840> even<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.200> low-light

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
get great pictures even in low-light

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
get great pictures even in low-light
situations<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.180> that's<00:01:54.420> obviously<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
situations and that's obviously one of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.539 
situations and that's obviously one of
the<00:01:55.500> major<00:01:55.649> problems<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.219> you're<00:01:56.310> shooting

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the major problems but you're shooting

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
the major problems but you're shooting
in<00:01:56.640> low<00:01:56.820> light<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.200> of

this camera and what makes the image
quality<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.920> fantastic<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:03.000> lens<00:03:03.330> and
