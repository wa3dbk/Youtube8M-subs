00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.580
 good night 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.130
 Welcome another night of our 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.350
 top 10 business project today one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.730
 very special night we had 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.560
 opportunity to receive some customers 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.250
 talk with the two speakers of the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.769
 night 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.230
 so we are very happy to welcome you 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.220
 and I'm sure you too will 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.050
 learn a lot 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.210
 he is considered the number 1 coach 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
 Brazil and believes that the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.340
 important than selling is to retain the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.899
 customer for as long as possible 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.219
 we will receive with a great salvo of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.219
 palms to the same silvio 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.050
 bill bill clinton 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.309
 because those seen in the care of a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.540
 I would rather be drunk 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.140
 because the customer deserves no customer 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.240
 the company does not light a lamp on 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.270
 any organization if it is the reason 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.040
 being of any and all business from the point 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.450
 Materially we all depend on the 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.310
 customer if we are to see that he was the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.350
 supermarket purchase at home he who 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.840
 paid the children's school then it is the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.040
 true boss that if people 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.410
 ask for any professional 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.070
 here what you have conquered with your 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.710
 work a home a computer one 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.360
 helicopter making the car come through 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.900
 of the customer 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.850
 second reason the service is not 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.890
 sometimes the person assembles a 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.440
 company puts people to meet 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.110
 as if they were machines working with 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.350
 service is strategic 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.540
 it can both leverage sales and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.980
 also cripple squid he can both 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.070
 leveraging the company as well as 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.270
 harms 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.220
 in this competition 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.410
 several competitors seeking same 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.420
 Warm in that there for the competition I with the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.670
 people find themselves in a bar 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.209
 meet well is a good up to a differential 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.310
 strategic because the customer when 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.500
 buy something he hopes to do the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.120
 better business because he for what 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.670
 she is waiting to receive the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.140
 better right and if it is well attended can 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.940
 be decisive in choosing it for a 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.230
 company for a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.690
 brand etc 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.500
 products are getting more and more 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.650
 equal prices are more and more equal 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.290
 quality is no more differential than 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.440
 have quality today or sit at the table 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.760
 to negotiate or enter the market what 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.390
 will make the customer choose a company 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.970
 and in the other what the customer will do 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.500
 choose a rubber shop and in the 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.580
 tire repair the same way 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.030
 to repair is the same 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.910
 I always say or you become 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.889
 different for your customer or he 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.889
 makes you indifferent to yourself 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.700
 while the gain to recommend 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.060
 this restaurant nothing why the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.680
 most profitable word of mouth 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.480
 invest in newspaper super radio television 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.220
 important but also in view of its 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.960
 customer because he has everything to be a 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.570
 good seller he knows what we people 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.130
 does he know people who need 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.810
 buy what we sell it account 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.580
 with the confidence of these people 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.800
 just people will love it and put it on 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.580
 sales chart without spending a penny 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:50.510
 recruitment training and 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:54.470
 cheering selection will find someone 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.470
 talk and drunkard praciano 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.340
 but anyway people what I mean 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.620
 I focused on the price of the shirt or 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.720
 benefits 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.330
 I focused on elegance, I focused on 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.550
 style that is the benefits that that 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:27.720
 shirt offered me if I focused on the 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:31.260
 price I would not buy the customer can 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.070
 dismiss everyone in the company including 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.930
 owner simply spending his money 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.030
 somewhere else 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.070
 It was with this philosophy like this one 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.240
 that this citizen created the largest chain of 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.590
 World retail started with although 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.140
 ended with the empire 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.970
 we see that the customer truly 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.010
 is the boss of the boss 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.210
 Now I want to share with you here. 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.430
 a tip today is what matters is not the 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.100
 that the customer buys, but rather the fact that he 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.790
 have chosen to buy from you or your 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.530
 store 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.720
 if the client is caught to crack 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.750
 buy the four tires of his car 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.979
 he is wonderfully well looked after 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.340
 if it is to change the valve that is the 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.810
 wonderfully well- attended bagatelle 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.910
 he was 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.370
 the tires a wonderfully courteous 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.389
 well understood I see the client does not 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.389
