life<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:51.159> are<00:01:51.460> elements<00:01:51.729> but<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.060> like

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
life so there are elements but I like

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.599 
life so there are elements but I like
the<00:01:52.420> broadness<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.960> feel<00:01:53.200> bulkier<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.340> like

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
the broadness I feel bulkier and I like

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.910 
the broadness I feel bulkier and I like
all<00:01:54.819> of<00:01:54.939> that<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.689> real<00:01:55.929> downside<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.770> this

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
all of that the real downside to this

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.959 
all of that the real downside to this
for<00:01:57.249> me<00:01:57.429> is<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.920> my<00:02:00.069> clothes<00:02:00.280> don't<00:02:00.549> fit<00:02:00.609> and

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
for me is that my clothes don't fit and

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.499 
for me is that my clothes don't fit and
I<00:02:01.600> have<00:02:01.749> a<00:02:01.780> wardrobe<00:02:02.069> filled<00:02:03.069> with<00:02:03.490> over<00:02:04.030> 40

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
I have a wardrobe filled with over 40

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.569 
I have a wardrobe filled with over 40
shirts<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.319> just<00:02:05.530> cannot<00:02:05.859> get<00:02:06.039> into<00:02:06.399> now

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
shirts that I just cannot get into now

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.790 
shirts that I just cannot get into now
and<00:02:06.819> that's<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.600> problem<00:02:07.810> for<00:02:08.020> me<00:02:08.259> it's<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.619> real

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
and that's a problem for me it's a real

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.320 
and that's a problem for me it's a real
problem<00:02:09.009> because<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.580> don't<00:02:09.789> want<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.209> to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
problem because I don't want to have to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.870 
problem because I don't want to have to
go<00:02:10.450> out<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.750> buy<00:02:11.260> 40<00:02:11.830> more<00:02:12.069> shirts<00:02:12.400> or<00:02:12.640> what

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
go out and buy 40 more shirts or what

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.360 
go out and buy 40 more shirts or what
even<00:02:13.180> ten<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:13.630> five<00:02:13.930> more<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.190> don't

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
even ten more five more because I don't

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.770 
even ten more five more because I don't
want<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:15.610> I've<00:02:15.700> got<00:02:15.850> loads<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.300> shirts<00:02:16.570> that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
want to I've got loads of shirts that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.290 
want to I've got loads of shirts that
are<00:02:17.020> all<00:02:17.230> still<00:02:17.680> new<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.460> could<00:02:18.640> wear<00:02:18.850> they

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
are all still new and I could wear they

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.150 
are all still new and I could wear they
look<00:02:19.510> great<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.350> can't<00:02:20.590> fit<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:20.950> them

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
look great but it just can't fit in them

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.610 
look great but it just can't fit in them
and<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> reason<00:02:22.960> for<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.380> tutorial

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and this is the reason for this tutorial

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.290 
and this is the reason for this tutorial
because<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.450> want<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.540> I'm<00:02:26.020> going<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:28.270> a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
because I want to I'm going to I have a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.660 
because I want to I'm going to I have a
background<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.900> nutrition<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:30.190> makes<00:02:30.430> sense

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
background in nutrition that makes sense

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.660 
background in nutrition that makes sense
before<00:02:30.910> makeup<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.050> studied<00:02:32.830> exercise<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
before makeup I studied exercise and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.750 
before makeup I studied exercise and
nutrition<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.770> followed<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.920> pretty<00:02:36.490> much<00:02:36.610> my

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
nutrition and followed it pretty much my

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.520 
nutrition and followed it pretty much my
whole<00:02:36.970> life<00:02:37.000> knew<00:02:37.600> what<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.840> was<00:02:37.990> doing<00:02:38.350> and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
whole life knew what I was doing and

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.520 
whole life knew what I was doing and
when<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.340> got<00:02:39.520> into<00:02:39.700> my<00:02:39.760> 30s<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:41.020> just

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
when I got into my 30s I just I just

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.230 
when I got into my 30s I just I just
wanted<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.830> break<00:02:41.980> from<00:02:42.040> everything<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:43.150> know

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
wanted a break from everything you know

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.120 
wanted a break from everything you know
I<00:02:43.270> was<00:02:43.510> tired<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.170> fed<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:45.010> thought

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
I was tired I just fed up I just thought

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.640 
I was tired I just fed up I just thought
I<00:02:45.370> solve<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.540> love<00:02:46.780> whatever<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.170> want<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.560> I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I solve it I love whatever I want and I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.980 
I solve it I love whatever I want and I
did<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.430> gained<00:02:48.640> weight<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.690> said

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
did and I gained weight and like I said

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.720 
did and I gained weight and like I said
it's<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.200> good<00:02:50.320> thing<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.680> bad<00:02:50.710> thing<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
it's a good thing and a bad thing the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.370 
it's a good thing and a bad thing the
only<00:02:52.090> thing<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.360> really<00:02:52.660> hate<00:02:52.840> about<00:02:52.870> being

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
only thing I really hate about being

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.250 
only thing I really hate about being
bigger<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:55.000> can't<00:02:55.480> fit<00:02:55.630> into<00:02:55.780> my<00:02:55.960> clothes

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
bigger is I can't fit into my clothes

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.890 
bigger is I can't fit into my clothes
because<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.680> really<00:02:56.980> cannot<00:02:57.250> fit<00:02:57.460> into<00:02:57.750> my<00:02:58.750> old

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
because I really cannot fit into my old

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.170 
because I really cannot fit into my old
shirts<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.470> the<00:03:00.010> fact<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.490> photographs

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
shirts and the fact that in photographs

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.360 
shirts and the fact that in photographs
I<00:03:01.480> just<00:03:01.690> kind<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.900> think<00:03:02.050> oh<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.160> really

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
I just kind of think oh is that really

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.990 
I just kind of think oh is that really
me<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.970> yeah<00:03:04.480> apparently<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.410> me<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.160> I'm

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
me and yeah apparently it is me so I'm

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.820 
me and yeah apparently it is me so I'm
going<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.360> share<00:03:07.540> with<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.900> on<00:03:08.170> what<00:03:08.740> I'm

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
going to share with you on what I'm

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.980 
going to share with you on what I'm
going<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.070> be<00:03:09.160> doing<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.670> get<00:03:10.510> back<00:03:10.660> into<00:03:10.870> my

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
going to be doing to get back into my

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.470 
going to be doing to get back into my
shirt<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.890> hope<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.250> lose<00:03:12.400> approximately<00:03:13.270> I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
shirt and I hope to lose approximately I

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.150 
shirt and I hope to lose approximately I
think<00:03:14.050> in<00:03:14.170> order<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.410> get<00:03:14.590> back<00:03:14.770> into<00:03:14.950> those

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
think in order to get back into those

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.890 
think in order to get back into those
shirts<00:03:15.370> I'll<00:03:15.580> probably<00:03:15.820> need<00:03:16.210> to<00:03:16.420> lose<00:03:16.570> around

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
shirts I'll probably need to lose around

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.620 
shirts I'll probably need to lose around
about<00:03:17.050> 20<00:03:17.380> pounds<00:03:17.740> so<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.670> over<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.060> stone<00:03:19.420> or

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
about 20 pounds so just over a stone or

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.340 
about 20 pounds so just over a stone or
so<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:21.640> will<00:03:22.030> discuss<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:22.900> we<00:03:23.140> go<00:03:23.320> along

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
so and I will discuss it as we go along

going back to a more structured eating
plan<00:03:29.530> I've<00:03:29.920> already<00:03:30.280> split<00:03:30.490> my<00:03:30.730> meals<00:03:31.380> into
