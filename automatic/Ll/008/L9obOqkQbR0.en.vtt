first<00:00:07.770> box<00:00:08.069> perhaps<00:00:08.309> open<00:00:08.700> up<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.210> majority

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
first box perhaps open up the majority

first box perhaps open up the majority
of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.719> box<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.320> then<00:00:11.070> hopefully<00:00:11.670> we'll

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
of the box and then hopefully we'll

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.629 
of the box and then hopefully we'll
figure<00:00:12.300> out<00:00:12.420> some<00:00:12.660> sort<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> code<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.639> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
figure out some sort of code and the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.519 
figure out some sort of code and the
goal<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.420> last<00:00:15.630> five<00:00:15.960> boxes<00:00:16.170> open

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
goal is for the last five boxes open

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.660 
goal is for the last five boxes open
five<00:00:16.830> packs<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:18.119> 5<00:00:18.330> x's<00:00:18.890> that<00:00:19.890> would<00:00:20.550> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
five packs and get 5 x's that would be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:35.479 
five packs and get 5 x's that would be
legit<00:00:25.310> all<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:27.529> majestic<00:00:28.849> dawn<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:34.460> know<00:00:35.460> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
legit all right majestic dawn I know I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.940 
legit all right majestic dawn I know I
open<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.940> box<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.719> while<00:00:37.440> ago<00:00:37.500> like

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
open some box to this a while ago like

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.740 
open some box to this a while ago like
in<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> SEC<00:00:38.309> came<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.879> remember<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.450> pack

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
in the SEC came out I remember what pack

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.740 
in the SEC came out I remember what pack
had<00:00:40.020> X<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.440> enough<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> one

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
had X is enough time and on this is one

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.470 
had X is enough time and on this is one
per<00:00:42.840> box<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.969> hopefully<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> figure<00:00:45.390> out

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
per box so hopefully we can figure out

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
per box so hopefully we can figure out
some<00:00:45.690> sort<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.960> code<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.770> always<00:00:46.920> do

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
some sort of code here like we always do

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.150

hollow Fiona we see me get a good number

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.800 
hollow Fiona we see me get a good number
of<00:04:37.330> hollows<00:04:38.190> we<00:04:39.190> will<00:04:39.370> have<00:04:39.490> like<00:04:39.669> a<00:04:40.060> pack<00:04:40.540> run

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
of hollows we will have like a pack run

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.460 
of hollows we will have like a pack run
or<00:04:40.930> something<00:04:41.050> where<00:04:41.320> we<00:04:41.380> get<00:04:41.500> no<00:04:41.620> hollows<00:04:41.979> now

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
or something where we get no hollows now

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.930 
or something where we get no hollows now
so<00:04:44.470> i<00:04:44.530> think<00:04:44.590> that's<00:04:44.830> five<00:04:45.130> holes<00:04:45.400> already<00:04:45.640> and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
so i think that's five holes already and

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.260 
so i think that's five holes already and
we<00:04:46.000> got<00:04:46.350> about<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.620> packs<00:04:47.919> left<00:04:48.160> on<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> side<00:04:48.700> so

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
reverse Toxicroak hollow Articuno so I I

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.810 
reverse Toxicroak hollow Articuno so I I
think<00:06:22.740> that's<00:06:22.920> the<00:06:23.070> six<00:06:23.280> hollow<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.700> row

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
think that's the six hollow of the row

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.500 
think that's the six hollow of the row
so<00:06:24.680> there<00:06:25.680> will<00:06:26.520> probably<00:06:26.790> nothing<00:06:27.270> us<00:06:27.390> in

so there will probably nothing us in

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:36.530 
so there will probably nothing us in
