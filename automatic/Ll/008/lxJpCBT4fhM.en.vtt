00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.900
 The Kolping Arena in Kloten: first reunion of Nati A for the start of the new season. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.040
 The Swiss stars of the NHL are too. 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.220
 The program is bushy ... 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.380
 ... the tasks that await players out of the ordinary. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.940
 This is the day of shootings, intended to develop autograph cards, posters and other commercials. 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.480
 I have to pronounce a sentence in Italian, for the app '... 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.880
 but alas, I do not speak Italian so I have to practice a little more! 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 Look there, up ... 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 Concentrate... 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.740
 Once again, it was great! 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.340
 A day like this, pretty cool, right? Or is it just a duty, after all? 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.120
 Both - sometimes it's a little boring, because we often have to wait a lot 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.340
 But overall, it's pretty funny. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.900
 We must also try the new complete ... 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.440
 At ease in there, hockey players? 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.500
 It's so rare that we have to wear them, so these few times, it's OK. Besides, I like it pretty well. 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 But of course, it's in my hockey gear that I feel better ... 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.620
 because we know that we will have to give our all, shortly. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 This season, the Nati will also count several newcomers. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.140
 And these new recruits, what can they learn from more experienced players? 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.980
 When we come here for the first time, everything is new: the frame, 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.480
 being able to wear the Swiss cross for the first time, 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.420
 so, we try to be inspired by their calmer attitude, acquired over the years ... 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 and that we have not yet, of course 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.720
 These are the kinds of things you learn from them. 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.900
 And what can a routinier convey to a "rookie"? 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.440
 Fun first: a factor that should never be forgotten in sports. 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.840
 It is a privilege, I think, to be able to make his sporting passion his job. 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.760
 So yes, the pleasure must prevail and must work hard every day, but ... also take his foot! 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.680
 And if a whistler could transmit something to his masters, it would be ...? 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.040
 A little more freshness and relaxed spirit, yes, no doubt it would not hurt ... 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.040
 Finally, you still have to take pictures of the whole team ... 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.920
 Thank you for staying upright and not to change position too much, yes ... 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.600
 also to possibly correct certain positions, afterwards, if necessary. 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.580
 That's it - look all straight in the lens ... 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.040
 Although no training session was on the program, today ... 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.100
 ... the players can finally go home: well-deserved relaxation!
