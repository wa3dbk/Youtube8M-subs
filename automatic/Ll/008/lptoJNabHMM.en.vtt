00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.170 
other ingredient that we
e<00:02:13.510> which<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.689> have<00:02:14.840> prepared<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.739> charissa

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
e which we have prepared is the charissa

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.849 
e which we have prepared is the charissa
so<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.329> first<00:02:17.480> thing<00:02:17.629> we<00:02:17.870> did<00:02:18.019> was<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.530> remove

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
so the first thing we did was to remove

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.880 
so the first thing we did was to remove
the<00:02:19.069> skin<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.609> chorizo<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:21.349> order<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.739> do

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the skin of the chorizo in order to do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.530 
the skin of the chorizo in order to do
that<00:02:22.069> all<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.430> need<00:02:22.549> to<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.939> take<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.180> chunk

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
that all you need to do is take a chunk

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.259 
that all you need to do is take a chunk
so<00:02:23.870> about<00:02:24.109> that<00:02:24.439> size<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:25.129> long<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.640> then

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
so about that size that long and then

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.800 
so about that size that long and then
just<00:02:26.510> make<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.469> down<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.549> back<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.120> skin

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
just make it down the back of the skin

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.599 
just make it down the back of the skin
and<00:02:30.109> then<00:02:30.500> you'll<00:02:30.530> find<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> skin<00:02:31.280> will<00:02:31.459> peel

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
and then you'll find the skin will peel

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.390 
and then you'll find the skin will peel
off<00:02:31.790> very<00:02:32.090> easily<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.680> having<00:02:33.950> skin<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
off very easily so having skin the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.429 
off very easily so having skin the
chorizo<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:35.150> then<00:02:35.299> just<00:02:35.540> slice<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.780> up<00:02:36.049> into

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
chorizo we then just slice it up into

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.050 
chorizo we then just slice it up into
chunks<00:02:36.640> something<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:41.000> doesn't

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
chunks something like that it doesn't

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.330 
chunks something like that it doesn't
really<00:02:41.450> matter<00:02:41.629> what<00:02:42.349> size<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.680> do<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.159> is<00:02:43.310> up

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
really matter what size you do it is up

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.830 
really matter what size you do it is up
to<00:02:43.639> you<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.030> can<00:02:44.060> get<00:02:44.299> a<00:02:44.329> little<00:02:44.540> bit<00:02:44.629> smaller

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
to you you can get a little bit smaller

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.110 
to you you can get a little bit smaller
a<00:02:45.019> little<00:02:45.049> bit<00:02:45.349> bigger<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.129> that<00:02:46.189> works<00:02:46.760> quite

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
a little bit bigger but that works quite

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.960 
a little bit bigger but that works quite
well<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.680> those<00:02:49.220> are<00:02:49.250> our<00:02:49.519> two<00:02:49.700> ingredients

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
well so those are our two ingredients

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.550 
well so those are our two ingredients
prepared<00:02:50.480> we've<00:02:50.900> got<00:02:51.109> the<00:02:51.200> other<00:02:51.319> ingredients

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
off and it was a bit dry so we get out

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.870 
off and it was a bit dry so we get out
half<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.260> teeth<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.680> half<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.069> tablespoon<00:04:06.250> full

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
of olive oil to it so that's been

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.900 
of olive oil to it so that's been
cooking<00:04:11.739> for<00:04:11.770> 10<00:04:12.069> minutes<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.610> what<00:04:12.790> we're
