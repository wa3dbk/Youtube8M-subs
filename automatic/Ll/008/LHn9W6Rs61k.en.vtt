00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
has to be rotating over so I have to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.270 
has to be rotating over so I have to
have<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.220> clubface<00:01:15.500> rotating<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:17.040> my

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
have my clubface rotating with my

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.690 
have my clubface rotating with my
forearms<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.840> club<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.530> traveling<00:01:20.220> out

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
forearms as my club is traveling out

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.350 
forearms as my club is traveling out
toward<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.720> right<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
toward the right a little bit that so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.210 
toward the right a little bit that so
remember<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.409> path<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.950> club's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
remember that the path the club's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
remember that the path the club's
traveling<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.030> where<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.330> ball<00:01:27.540> starts

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
traveling on it's where your ball starts

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
traveling on it's where your ball starts
what<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.920> clubface<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.430> doing<00:01:30.000> through<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
what your clubface is doing through the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510 
what your clubface is doing through the
ball<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.170> curves<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.340> like

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
ball is how it curves it's just like

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.830 
ball is how it curves it's just like
pitching<00:01:33.020> wherever<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.110> throw<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.799> arm<00:01:35.040> is

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
pitching wherever I throw my arm is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.990 
pitching wherever I throw my arm is
where<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.409> ball<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> start<00:01:38.280> how<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
where the ball is going to start how I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.539 
where the ball is going to start how I
spin<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.290> let<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.189> how<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
spin it when I let it go is how it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.120 
spin it when I let it go is how it's
going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> curve<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> end<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:43.950> what

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
going to curve on the end so that's what

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.499 
going to curve on the end so that's what
we're<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> hit<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> draw

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
we're going to do here to hit a draw

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
we're going to do here to hit a draw
we've<00:01:46.409> got<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> club<00:01:47.340> coming<00:01:47.670> from

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we've got to get the club coming from

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.560 
we've got to get the club coming from
the<00:01:48.119> inside<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.579> rotate<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> hands<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the inside and rotate the hands over the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.969 
the inside and rotate the hands over the
golf<00:01:51.750> ball<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.770> make<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
golf ball let's see if we can make that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.060 
golf ball let's see if we can make that
happen

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.060 

pretty<00:01:59.070> close<00:01:59.780> maybe<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.290> little<00:02:01.320> late<00:02:01.860> on

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
pretty close maybe just a little late on

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.649 
pretty close maybe just a little late on
the<00:02:02.100> crossing<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:03.060> hands<00:02:03.360> right<00:02:03.600> there

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the crossing of my hands right there

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.260 
the crossing of my hands right there
definitely<00:02:04.350> got<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> club<00:02:05.130> inside<00:02:05.670> very<00:02:06.000> well

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
