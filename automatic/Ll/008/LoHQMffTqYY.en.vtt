00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then you have to adjust it to where it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.959 
then you have to adjust it to where it
just<00:00:52.800> reflects<00:00:53.160> its<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.579> simple<00:00:53.730> actually

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
just reflects its really simple actually

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
just reflects its really simple actually
see<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.960> down<00:00:55.410> far<00:00:55.680> enough<00:00:55.710> softer<00:00:56.340> it's

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
see it's not down far enough softer it's

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.340 
see it's not down far enough softer it's
not<00:00:57.030> close<00:00:57.420> enough<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.170> change

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
not close enough and have to go change

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
not close enough and have to go change
it<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.910> then<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> it's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it and then now you see it it's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.530 
it and then now you see it it's
reflecting<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:05.119> that's<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.420> there

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
reflecting and that's really all there

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.649 
reflecting and that's really all there
is<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.549> then<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.390> back<00:01:09.630> up
