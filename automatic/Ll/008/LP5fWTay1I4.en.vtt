against<00:01:30.960> Anderson<00:01:31.380> Silva<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.860> mean<00:01:32.280> how<00:01:32.369> could

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
against Anderson Silva I mean how could

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.120 
against Anderson Silva I mean how could
he<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.970> saw<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> first<00:01:33.270> fight<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.130> in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
he not you saw the first fight and in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.730 
he not you saw the first fight and in
this<00:01:35.280> fight<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.790> think<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.049> fight<00:01:37.439> would<00:01:37.590> be

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this fight I think the fight would be

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890 
this fight I think the fight would be
different<00:01:38.220> Anderson's<00:01:38.670> over<00:01:39.000> various<00:01:39.509> shots

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
different Anderson's over various shots

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.830 
different Anderson's over various shots
on<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.140> point<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.840> how

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on the point to and in what way how

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
on the point to and in what way how
would<00:01:43.259> shell<00:01:43.470> Sonnen<00:01:43.829> step<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.490> his<00:01:44.610> game<00:01:44.670> how

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
would shell Sonnen step up his game how

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.700 
would shell Sonnen step up his game how
would<00:01:45.240> he<00:01:45.299> change<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.750> his<00:01:45.810> game<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:47.030> think<00:01:48.030> that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
would he change up his game I think that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
would he change up his game I think that
he<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.829> know<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.729> he<00:01:50.939> wants

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
he would know that you know he wants

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
he would know that you know he wants
taken<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> ground<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.290> he<00:01:52.979> would<00:01:53.130> know

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
taken to the ground and he would know

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460 
taken to the ground and he would know
that<00:01:53.310> he<00:01:53.610> can't<00:01:53.850> take<00:01:54.000> him<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.299> ground<00:01:54.570> now

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that he can't take him to the ground now

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
that he can't take him to the ground now
