one of the doors on our 68 Camaro called
reloaded<00:00:08.099> had<00:00:08.760> some<00:00:09.030> fairly<00:00:09.389> significant

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
reloaded had some fairly significant

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.200 
reloaded had some fairly significant
damage<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.740> door<00:00:10.920> skin<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> inner

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
damage to the door skin but the inner

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
damage to the door skin but the inner
structure<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.410> really<00:00:13.620> nice<00:00:13.799> shape

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
structure was in really nice shape

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.390 
structure was in really nice shape
so<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.000> elected<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.540> reskin<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.350> door<00:00:16.619> using<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
so we elected to reskin the door using a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.240 
so we elected to reskin the door using a
new<00:00:17.520> door<00:00:17.789> scan<00:00:18.150> from<00:00:18.570> classic<00:00:18.990> industries

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
new door scan from classic industries

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
new door scan from classic industries
the<00:00:20.250> decision<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.970> reskin<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.720> original<00:00:22.170> door

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the decision to reskin the original door

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.490 
the decision to reskin the original door
was<00:00:22.830> made<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.789> nothing<00:00:24.630> fits<00:00:24.960> quite<00:00:25.350> as

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
was made because nothing fits quite as

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
was made because nothing fits quite as
well<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.250> original<00:00:26.699> part<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.180> came<00:00:27.359> off

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
well as the original part that came off

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.290 
well as the original part that came off
the<00:00:27.599> original<00:00:27.869> car<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.310> inner<00:00:29.699> structure

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the original car so that inner structure

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.720 
the original car so that inner structure
is<00:00:30.720> primarily<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:31.800> helps<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> door<00:00:32.399> fit

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
is primarily what helps the door fit

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.150 
is primarily what helps the door fit
properly<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.360> car<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.260> ours<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.980> not

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
properly to the car so ours was not

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.360 
properly to the car so ours was not
bashed<00:00:35.940> up<00:00:36.270> or<00:00:36.570> rusted<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.950> decided<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
bashed up or rusted up so we decided to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.900 
bashed up or rusted up so we decided to
reuse<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.969> inner<00:00:39.180> structure<00:00:40.550> we<00:00:41.550> started

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
reuse that inner structure we started

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
reuse that inner structure we started
this<00:00:42.000> process<00:00:42.270> by<00:00:42.840> removing<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.469> outer<00:00:43.620> skin

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this process by removing the outer skin

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.340 
this process by removing the outer skin
from<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> original<00:00:44.940> shell<00:00:45.270> using<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.110> large

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
from the original shell using a large

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.889 
from the original shell using a large
sander<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.370> got<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:47.969> careful<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.690> cut

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
sander you got to be careful not to cut

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
sander you got to be careful not to cut
away<00:00:48.989> too<00:00:49.379> much<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> original<00:00:50.250> shell

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
away too much of the original shell

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.680 
away too much of the original shell
where<00:00:51.000> new<00:00:51.270> skin<00:00:51.600> won't<00:00:51.750> fit<00:00:52.050> properly<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
where new skin won't fit properly and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
where new skin won't fit properly and
then<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:55.020> media<00:00:55.350> blasted<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> whole<00:00:56.129> inner

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
then we media blasted the whole inner

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.639 
then we media blasted the whole inner
door<00:00:56.610> structure<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> shot<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> with<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> white

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
door structure and shot it with a white

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.970 
door structure and shot it with a white
epoxy<00:00:59.280> primer<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.969> then<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.440> took<00:01:01.620> our<00:01:01.770> new

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
epoxy primer and then we took our new

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.359 
epoxy primer and then we took our new
classic<00:01:02.820> industries<00:01:03.059> drawer<00:01:03.480> skin<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
classic industries drawer skin and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.520 
classic industries drawer skin and
pre-drilled<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:06.000> plug<00:01:06.540> weld<00:01:06.810> holes<00:01:06.930> along

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
pre-drilled some plug weld holes along

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
pre-drilled some plug weld holes along
the<00:01:07.590> bottom<00:01:07.890> edge<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.939> when<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> new

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510 
shell we'd have a place to weld the two
together<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:16.320> scuffed<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> inside<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
together we scuffed the inside of the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.340 
together we scuffed the inside of the
door<00:01:17.729> skin<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.930> we're<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> be

perimeter so that the two will bond
together<00:01:40.619> strongly<00:01:41.240> then<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.600> work<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
together strongly then you work the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.469 
together strongly then you work the
inner<00:01:43.229> structure<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.579> door<00:01:44.759> skin<00:01:45.180> and

the<00:03:51.500> precision<00:03:52.010> fit<00:03:52.340> of<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.550> door<00:03:52.730> gaps<00:03:53.000> in

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
the precision fit of the door gaps in

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.360 
the precision fit of the door gaps in
relation<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.379> quarter<00:03:54.680> panel<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.069> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
relation to the quarter panel and the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.610 
relation to the quarter panel and the
rocker<00:03:55.580> panel<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.209> fender<00:03:56.569> so<00:03:57.230> we<00:03:57.410> might

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
rocker panel and the fender so we might

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.440 
rocker panel and the fender so we might
actually<00:03:57.830> add<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:58.519> material<00:03:59.120> to<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
actually add a little material to the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.360 
actually add a little material to the
leading<00:03:59.780> edge<00:03:59.959> or<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.500> back<00:04:00.709> edge<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.190> this

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
leading edge or the back edge of this

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.880 
leading edge or the back edge of this
door<00:04:01.700> but<00:04:02.390> we'll<00:04:02.630> get<00:04:02.780> into<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.050> later<00:04:03.470> on

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
door but we'll get into that later on

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.009 
door but we'll get into that later on
when<00:04:04.580> we<00:04:04.700> showed<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.090> bodywork<00:04:05.510> process

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
when we showed you the bodywork process

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.750 
when we showed you the bodywork process
