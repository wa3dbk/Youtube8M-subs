00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 the beauty then is to praise the forums and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.970
 blogs of people trying lodges 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.340
 although mil.com trusted unemployment in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.250
 Brazil that has to pay tax 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.840
 I decided to do internship with prourb 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 tep and an optimal protein if 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 a tape to take the measurements was 4 99 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.150
 dollars and protect the little one gave 14 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.759
 99 dollars 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.180
 a total of $ 19 98 plus freight 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.719
 was $ 15 from the $ 85 order 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 total approximately 70 reais and seventy 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 and a real is not dropped nine 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.449
 I had to pay no taxes and only 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 the value of products plus freight 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 I made the request on March 21 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:03.890
 arrived on July 20 about two 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:10.729
 You're here for months to get 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:19.130
 was made of fiber that fits into the hole 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:25.380
 and play a play that the necklace isolated and 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 450 grams is to buy na na na bola e 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.360
 saw a point with is so simple is it really 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.890
 it is as if I were shopping in the store 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.670
 normally puts their data 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.810
 without anything very specific and does the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.770
 I usually do not need a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.140
 nothing different nothing special or english 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.220
 just fill out the registration and make the request 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 normally 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.979
 I paid via paypal with a credit card 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.640
 and this is the store in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.680
 bollywood delivered so is the tip that 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.610
 stay is if you want any request 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.140
 above 50 dollars have the probability 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.619
 very high of falling into customs and you have 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.619
 to pay tax 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.340
 what you buy may not worth the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.989
 Worth buying at the Gringa store because you 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.579
 You will have to end up paying this momentum 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.549
 my product 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:30.000
 then the tip is if the request for less 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.099
 of $ 50 or if it 's over $ 50 and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.400
 I was still paying tax was more 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.689
 cheap than buying in brazil is worth 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.060
 feather 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:43.189
 then the tip is the link to the store 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.189
 It's there in the video description
