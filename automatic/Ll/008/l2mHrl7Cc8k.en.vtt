tank it looks like this one actually has

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.019 
tank it looks like this one actually has
a<00:00:26.300> trigger<00:00:26.690> and<00:00:27.020> how<00:00:27.680> awesome<00:00:27.980> is<00:00:28.490> that<00:00:28.520> I'm

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
a trigger and how awesome is that I'm

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.430 
a trigger and how awesome is that I'm
very<00:00:29.240> very<00:00:29.390> excited<00:00:30.020> about<00:00:30.080> that

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
very very excited about that

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.979 
very very excited about that
and<00:00:30.680> it<00:00:31.039> has<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.490> option<00:00:31.940> to<00:00:32.090> attach<00:00:32.210> a<00:00:32.809> hose

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
and it has the option to attach a hose

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.950 
and it has the option to attach a hose
to<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:33.800> because<00:00:34.699> he<00:00:35.000> who<00:00:35.149> controls<00:00:35.359> the<00:00:35.780> hose

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
to it because he who controls the hose

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.649 
to it because he who controls the hose
controls<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.800> war<00:00:37.010> in<00:00:37.339> any<00:00:37.879> sort<00:00:38.239> of<00:00:38.329> super

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
controls the war in any sort of super

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.149 
controls the war in any sort of super
circular<00:00:38.899> battle<00:00:39.379> which<00:00:39.499> is<00:00:39.649> really<00:00:39.949> really

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
circular battle which is really really

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.950 
circular battle which is really really
cool<00:00:40.339> so<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:40.699> nozzle<00:00:41.089> is<00:00:41.179> down<00:00:41.389> there<00:00:41.659> and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
cool so that nozzle is down there and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.930 
cool so that nozzle is down there and
you<00:00:42.949> can<00:00:42.979> see<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.460> there's<00:00:43.639> the<00:00:43.760> title

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
you can see that there's the title

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.790 
you can see that there's the title
torpedo<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:44.600> barrage<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:45.109> the<00:00:45.199> flash<00:00:45.440> flood

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
torpedo the barrage and the flash flood

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.239 
torpedo the barrage and the flash flood
in<00:00:45.979> this<00:00:46.429> photo<00:00:46.699> but<00:00:46.999> this<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.440> flood<00:00:48.979> fire

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
in this photo but this is the flood fire

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.090 
in this photo but this is the flood fire
definitely<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.539> macdaddy<00:00:50.960> o<00:00:51.139> of<00:00:51.499> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
definitely the the macdaddy o of the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.439 
definitely the the macdaddy o of the
line<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:52.579> we're<00:00:52.699> going<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.850> go<00:00:52.969> ahead<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:53.329> get

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
line so we're going to go ahead and get

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.029 
line so we're going to go ahead and get
it<00:00:53.539> out<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.870> then<00:00:53.989> we'll<00:00:54.109> fill<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.499> in<00:00:54.920> a

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
it out and then we'll fill it in a

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.799 
it out and then we'll fill it in a
second<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:55.670> take<00:00:55.819> a<00:00:55.850> really<00:00:56.209> good<00:00:56.239> look<00:00:56.420> at

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
second and take a really good look at

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.060 
second and take a really good look at
its<00:00:57.379> performance<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.479> think<00:01:00.100> that's<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.249> so

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
its performance I think that's that so

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.130 
its performance I think that's that so
here's<00:01:04.070> our<00:01:04.220> optional<00:01:04.729> hose<00:01:04.970> attachment<00:01:05.720> I'll

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
here's our optional hose attachment I'll

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.440 
here's our optional hose attachment I'll
take<00:01:06.440> that<00:01:06.590> out<00:01:06.650> too<00:01:06.979> while<00:01:07.190> I'm<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.460> here<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
take that out too while I'm in here and

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.410 
take that out too while I'm in here and
I<00:01:11.680> would<00:01:12.680> keep<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.100> on<00:01:13.280> at<00:01:13.610> all<00:01:13.820> times<00:01:14.150> just

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
I would keep this on at all times just

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.300 
I would keep this on at all times just
because<00:01:14.870> I<00:01:14.900> don't<00:01:15.170> like<00:01:15.380> having<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:15.830> exposed

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
because I don't like having this exposed

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.420 
because I don't like having this exposed
oh<00:01:16.520> ring<00:01:16.850> down<00:01:17.090> here<00:01:17.480> so<00:01:17.990> wow<00:01:18.650> there's<00:01:18.980> a<00:01:19.040> shade

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
oh ring down here so wow there's a shade

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.420 
oh ring down here so wow there's a shade
we<00:01:19.700> needed<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.810> looks<00:01:21.020> like<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:21.320> just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
we needed that it looks like this just

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.990 
we needed that it looks like this just
clicks<00:01:22.430> into<00:01:22.640> place

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
clicks into place

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.840 
clicks into place
and<00:01:23.360> then<00:01:23.840> has<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.080> valve<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:25.130> open<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and then has a valve to open it and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.250 
and then has a valve to open it and
close<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.420> depending<00:01:26.750> upon<00:01:26.840> if<00:01:27.080> that's

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
close it depending upon if that's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.250 
close it depending upon if that's
something<00:01:27.470> you<00:01:27.710> want<00:01:27.860> to<00:01:27.920> be<00:01:27.980> using<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.260> some

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
something you want to be using and some

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.660 
something you want to be using and some
sort<00:01:30.470> of<00:01:30.530> locking<00:01:30.920> mechanism<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.550> it's

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
sort of locking mechanism so it's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.700 
sort of locking mechanism so it's
supposed<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.060> go<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.050> now<00:01:33.530> it's

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
supposed to go on like that and now it's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.420 
supposed to go on like that and now it's
very<00:01:34.010> very<00:01:34.340> secure<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.300> also<00:01:36.040> that<00:01:37.040> seems<00:01:37.310> to

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
very very secure it also that seems to

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.010 
very very secure it also that seems to
be<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> only<00:01:37.760> way<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.060> get<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.390> on<00:01:38.510> really

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
be the only way to get it on really

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.780 
be the only way to get it on really
really<00:01:39.410> securely<00:01:39.830> is<00:01:40.010> to<00:01:40.130> pull<00:01:40.340> down<00:01:40.460> this

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
really securely is to pull down this

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.690 
really securely is to pull down this
gasket<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:41.930> attach<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:42.530> very<00:01:43.130> solid

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
gasket and attach it very solid

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.370 
gasket and attach it very solid
connection<00:01:44.180> once<00:01:44.390> it's<00:01:44.570> in<00:01:44.720> place<00:01:44.960> which<00:01:45.230> is

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
connection once it's in place which is

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.230 
connection once it's in place which is
super<00:01:45.680> duper<00:01:45.770> cool<00:01:46.100> I'm<00:01:46.370> pretty<00:01:46.850> sure<00:01:47.000> that

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
super duper cool I'm pretty sure that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.480 
super duper cool I'm pretty sure that
fills<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.080> main<00:01:48.350> reservoir<00:01:48.650> doesn't<00:01:49.370> do

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
fills the main reservoir doesn't do

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.430 
fills the main reservoir doesn't do
anything<00:01:50.300> else<00:01:50.480> so<00:01:50.750> I'm<00:01:50.900> going<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.140> fill<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
anything else so I'm going to fill the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.730 
anything else so I'm going to fill the
main<00:01:51.590> reservoir<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:53.210> probably<00:01:53.659> won't<00:01:54.530> use

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
main reservoir and I probably won't use

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.560 
main reservoir and I probably won't use
this<00:01:55.070> but<00:01:55.310> I'll<00:01:55.400> test<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:56.180> can<00:01:56.360> talk

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
this but I'll test it so that I can talk

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.930 
this but I'll test it so that I can talk
about<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.230> then<00:01:57.650> we'll<00:01:57.890> come<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.580> see

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
about it and then we'll come in and see

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.030 
about it and then we'll come in and see
see<00:01:59.630> how<00:01:59.810> we<00:01:59.870> like<00:02:00.110> this<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.620> is<00:02:00.800> an

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
see how we like this this is an

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.770 
see how we like this this is an
interesting<00:02:01.490> mechanism<00:02:01.820> it's<00:02:02.330> really<00:02:02.600> good

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
interesting mechanism it's really good

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.930 
interesting mechanism it's really good
to<00:02:03.260> see<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.440> trigger<00:02:03.770> on<00:02:03.950> super<00:02:04.340> soakers<00:02:04.670> again

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
to see a trigger on super soakers again

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.680 
to see a trigger on super soakers again
that<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.240> very<00:02:05.810> very<00:02:06.050> new

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 

so<00:02:10.590> we've<00:02:10.830> gone<00:02:10.950> ahead<00:02:11.010> and<00:02:11.250> pressurized<00:02:11.820> our

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
so we've gone ahead and pressurized our

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520 
so we've gone ahead and pressurized our
hose<00:02:12.180> line<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:12.870> definitely<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
hose line because that's definitely the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.580 
hose line because that's definitely the
best<00:02:13.560> way<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.010> use<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.850> flood<00:02:15.120> fire<00:02:15.590> pretty

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
best way to use the flood fire pretty

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.260 
best way to use the flood fire pretty
clear<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:16.920> opening<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.520> valve<00:02:17.580> does<00:02:18.060> what

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
clear that opening this valve does what

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.840 
clear that opening this valve does what
we<00:02:18.360> needed<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.720> do<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.990> goes<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.320> work<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.920> this

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
we needed to do it goes to work and this

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.200 
we needed to do it goes to work and this
has<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.110> attachment<00:02:22.980> where<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.880> should<00:02:24.090> be

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
has the attachment where we should be

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.450 
has the attachment where we should be
able<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.510> open<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.740> fill<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.160> entire

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
able to open it up to fill the entire

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.670 
able to open it up to fill the entire
cabin<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.240> then<00:02:27.750> filling<00:02:28.020> this<00:02:28.350> should<00:02:28.560> be

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
cabin and then filling this should be

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
cabin and then filling this should be
very<00:02:28.890> quick<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.580> lock<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.450> on<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.700> there

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
very quick just lock that on and there

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.560 
very quick just lock that on and there
we<00:02:32.880> go<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:34.260> was<00:02:34.440> easy<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.240> think<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.390> going<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
we go it was easy I think it's going to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.390 
we go it was easy I think it's going to
fill<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> entire<00:02:37.080> tank<00:02:37.470> very<00:02:37.770> quickly<00:02:38.130> this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
fill the entire tank very quickly this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.660 
fill the entire tank very quickly this
is<00:02:38.480> wow<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.750> was<00:02:39.870> under<00:02:40.350> light<00:02:40.620> how<00:02:41.550> many

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
is wow that was under light how many

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.800 
is wow that was under light how many
seconds<00:02:42.000> was<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.480> 10<00:02:42.750> close<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.500> first

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
seconds was that like 10 close it first

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.590 
seconds was that like 10 close it first
definitely<00:02:45.810> have<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.170> close<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:47.600> then

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
definitely have to close it and then

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.040 
definitely have to close it and then
firing<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:52.190> trigger<00:02:53.210> here<00:02:54.210> let<00:02:54.390> me<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:55.010> so

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
firing it trigger here let me see so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.200 
firing it trigger here let me see so
opening<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.380> pressurizes<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.580> then

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
opening this up pressurizes it and then

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.360 
opening this up pressurizes it and then
pull<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.750> trigger<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.170> fire<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.340> just

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pull the trigger to fire and we just

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.570 
pull the trigger to fire and we just
have<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.670> constant<00:03:03.080> stream<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:05.660> water<00:03:06.660> power

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
have a constant stream of water power

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.560 
have a constant stream of water power
definitely<00:03:08.580> not<00:03:08.760> getting<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.120> ranges<00:03:09.480> that

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
definitely not getting the ranges that

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.360 
definitely not getting the ranges that
it's<00:03:09.750> claiming<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.320> only<00:03:10.560> about<00:03:10.800> 20<00:03:11.220> feet

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
it's claiming this is only about 20 feet

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.750 
it's claiming this is only about 20 feet
and<00:03:11.550> that's<00:03:11.670> full<00:03:11.970> force<00:03:13.070> I'm<00:03:14.070> assuming<00:03:14.730> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
and that's full force I'm assuming that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.810 
and that's full force I'm assuming that
if<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.120> close<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.660> valve<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.340> disconnect<00:03:17.340> we

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
if we close this valve and disconnect we

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.540 
if we close this valve and disconnect we
now<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> full<00:03:18.480> Soaker<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.290> oh<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.310> still

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
now have a full Soaker and oh it still

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.670 
now have a full Soaker and oh it still
held<00:03:20.730> some<00:03:20.940> pressure<00:03:21.180> that's<00:03:21.750> very<00:03:22.110> fun<00:03:22.410> we

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
held some pressure that's very fun we

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.620 
held some pressure that's very fun we
haven't<00:03:22.890> had<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> pressure<00:03:23.670> system<00:03:24.270> Super

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
haven't had a pressure system Super

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.870 
haven't had a pressure system Super
Soaker<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.290> long<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.250> i<00:03:26.310> pressurize

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
Soaker and so long so can i pressurize

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.050 
Soaker and so long so can i pressurize
it<00:03:26.910> with<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.300> or<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:28.130> nope<00:03:29.130> again

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
it with this or is this just nope again

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.790 
it with this or is this just nope again
the<00:03:30.420> loss<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> patent<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.320> killing<00:03:31.680> me

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
the loss of the patent is killing me

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.130 
the loss of the patent is killing me
because<00:03:31.920> now<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.790> locks<00:03:33.180> unless<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
because now this locks unless the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.930 
because now this locks unless the
trigger<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.500> down<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.100> can't<00:03:35.340> pressurize

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
trigger is down so you can't pressurize

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.390 
trigger is down so you can't pressurize
this<00:03:36.270> it's<00:03:36.780> always<00:03:37.350> locked<00:03:37.740> unless<00:03:38.220> the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
this it's always locked unless the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.830 
this it's always locked unless the
triggers<00:03:38.730> pulled<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.209> hold<00:03:39.510> down<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
triggers pulled so you hold down the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.449 
triggers pulled so you hold down the
trigger<00:03:40.020> now<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.410> like<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> laser<00:03:40.860> tag<00:03:41.220> gun

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
trigger now and like a laser tag gun

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.729 
trigger now and like a laser tag gun
with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> trigger<00:03:42.360> on<00:03:42.450> it's<00:03:43.080> always<00:03:43.410> going<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
with the trigger on it's always going to

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.640 
with the trigger on it's always going to
there<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.860> go<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.610> is<00:03:47.850> oh<00:03:49.550> not<00:03:50.550> again

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
there we go it is oh not again

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.550 
there we go it is oh not again
I<00:03:52.790> guess<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.909> deserve<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.689> but<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.319> made<00:03:55.530> a

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
I guess I deserve that but you made a

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.240 
I guess I deserve that but you made a
fatal<00:03:55.860> error<00:03:57.110> he<00:03:58.110> who<00:03:58.260> controls<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:02.010> hose
