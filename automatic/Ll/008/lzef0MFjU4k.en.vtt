so here over here if we go over here we

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.220 
so here over here if we go over here we
could<00:00:07.980> almost<00:00:08.160> these<00:00:09.120> can<00:00:09.389> stick<00:00:09.660> down<00:00:09.870> into

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230

the<00:00:10.349> bark<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.740> little<00:00:10.980> bit<00:00:11.130> because<00:00:11.309> my<00:00:11.490> turn

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the bark a little bit because my turn

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.490 
the bark a little bit because my turn
shape<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> be<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.259> little

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
shape is it's going to be a little

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.099 
shape is it's going to be a little
curving<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.400> outside<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.719> then<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.960> can

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
curving up on the outside and then I can

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.510 
curving up on the outside and then I can
look<00:00:16.230> under<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.859> say<00:00:17.010> hey<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.400> know

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
look under here and say hey you know

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.859 
look under here and say hey you know
that<00:00:17.550> wouldn't<00:00:17.910> look<00:00:18.029> half<00:00:18.090> bad<00:00:18.300> like

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
that wouldn't look half bad like

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.480 
that wouldn't look half bad like
curtains<00:00:19.260> hanging<00:00:19.500> down<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.160> front<00:00:20.400> of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
curtains hanging down on the front of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the Hat I can even like very very very

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.380 
the Hat I can even like very very very
helpful<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:28.400> like<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.910> things<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.330> do

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
helpful and like a lot of things I do

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.860 
helpful and like a lot of things I do
and<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.019> say<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.410> constantly<00:00:32.360> not<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.690> for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
and I say this constantly not just for

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
and I say this constantly not just for
hats<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.920> would<00:00:35.100> be<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> great<00:00:35.489> thing<00:00:35.700> for

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
hats this would be a great thing for

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.470 
hats this would be a great thing for
it's<00:00:36.450> getting<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.610> figure<00:00:38.610> color<00:00:39.059> whatever

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's getting that figure color whatever

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.490 
it's getting that figure color whatever
to<00:00:39.960> lay<00:00:40.170> nicely<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> bowl<00:00:41.129> whoo<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> that's<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
to lay nicely in a bowl whoo so that's a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.240 
to lay nicely in a bowl whoo so that's a
possibility<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:46.200> these<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.649> very<00:00:46.890> similar

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
possibility and these are very similar

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
possibility and these are very similar
there<00:00:47.640> sister<00:00:47.910> Pete<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.480> obviously<00:00:49.200> stood

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
there sister Pete this obviously stood

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.510 
there sister Pete this obviously stood
right<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.739> because<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.160> got<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> same

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
right there because we got the same

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.540 
right there because we got the same
little<00:00:50.700> bar<00:00:51.000> conclusion<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.550> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
little bar conclusion there and there so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.670 
little bar conclusion there and there so
that<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> sister<00:00:55.199> hat<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
that that could make a sister hat to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.500 
that that could make a sister hat to
this<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.129> would<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.460> similar<00:01:02.510> if

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this that would look very similar if

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
this that would look very similar if
we're<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.899> go<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> ash<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.830> would<00:01:04.979> say

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
we're gonna go with the ash I would say

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
we're gonna go with the ash I would say
that<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> positioning<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that would be the positioning for the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.100 
that would be the positioning for the
the<00:01:07.409> nicest<00:01:07.950> hat<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:09.450> big<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.930> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the nicest hat and then as big as this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
the nicest hat and then as big as this
is<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> problem

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
is you have to really have a problem

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.920 
is you have to really have a problem
getting<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.470> hat<00:01:13.799> anywhere<00:01:14.520> else<00:01:14.810> with<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
getting a hat anywhere else with the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.609 
getting a hat anywhere else with the
brim<00:01:16.140> outward<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> turn<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.939> around

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
brim outward when you turn this around

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.560 
brim outward when you turn this around
now<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.540> away

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
now you can get like this and get away

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830 
now you can get like this and get away
from<00:01:21.780> cracks<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.189> not<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.150> nice<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> hat

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
