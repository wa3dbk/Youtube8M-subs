00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.819
 Hi everyone, here I am again as a 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.080
 second video on some froyo news 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.210
 2.2 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.350
 this morning I had already done another 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.150
 video I had to put some features 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.519
 main but in the afternoon I am 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.119
 noticed that there are other small news 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.890
 that you might be interested in this 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.650
 video you will see 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.160
 3 but surely later or I will discover 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.870
 of the others but I wanted to share it 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.629
 because I think it could be there 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:43.190
 interesting and useful then as before 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.680
 what about the messages they put this 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.019
 new feature I take the opportunity to 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.350
 show you how a keyboard works 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.600
 swype for those not yet familiar 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.710
 this method of insertion then 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.840
 we open the messages and now I have here 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.190
 already a message saved alone plus it 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.060
 delete everything by holding down the button 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.130
 to delete it and nothing wipe works 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.090
 that we if we want to write every 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.550
 single word 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.440
 it will suffice that we pass on to the individual 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.160
 letters without ever taking your finger off like 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:26.630
 in this case you will see me then 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:30.140
 I'll write hello I 'm home 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.299
 ok the problem we had before is that 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.850
 if we wanted to go and change the text 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.300
 inside this box and some text 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.410
 began to be long 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.940
 we often became crazy to do this 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.710
 while now if we go to click of 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.940
 andrea text box and we want it 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.060
 move precisely to a point us 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.770
 the more I call into the text and a will appear 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:00.850
 pallino that will help us to move into 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.440
 very precise way in the test at the point of 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.540
 text in which we want the facts are 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.040
 let's get this little ball e 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.010
 We drag the whole text he 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.140
 will place our cursor 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.330
 in the point we want and more 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.120
 will allow to paste cut and 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.830
 glue precisely any 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.010
 portion of text we want 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.610
 this is what I think is a modification 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.590
 very important then coming back 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.360
 back 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:37.300
 ok another novelty that I could see 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:45.370
 and while browsing the internet 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:47.500
 where we can open the menu of 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 internet adjust the brightness 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.420
 in fact if now I raise the brightness 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.150
 you will not see anything 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.120
 in fact I apologize for the quality of the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.099
 video is but it's the best I can do 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.300
 you will see that the screen will light up 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.260
 more while we are going to 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.810
 to decrease 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.900
 during our navigation we could 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.000
 of precisely lowering the brightness 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.880
 another novelty is that if we go 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.680
 add new windows now in a 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.800
 piero 5 going to select the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.310
 windows open now we will have this 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.040
 screen with all tab tabs 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.110
 internet open and if we want to go to 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.959
 shut up that push moix and him 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.580
 we will go to close they did not make me 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.630
 sun I close all I was left alone 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.400
 a 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.950
 we want to add another will suffice 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:47.049
 push on this button more indeed 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.290
 now we will have two tabs another thing 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.510
 interesting and the integration of flash 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.970
 things I can't show you 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.340
 why 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.100
 here the brightness I can not make you 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.350
 see through the webcam is that if not 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.120
 let's browse in flash sites or 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.720
 in sites will need to embedded video 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.340
 youtube we can see them 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.430
 without other external plugins opening 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:18.480
 then he said this and other small ones 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:23.960
 novelties are also in the status bar 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:27.420
 where when we will activate connections 3g 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.729
 hhs dpa etc. have changed 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.589
 slightly 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.719
 the icon for the moment to behold another 

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.729
 which I could see a lot 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:40.580
 interesting is that they have changed some 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.479
 functions in the camera in fact if we 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.270
 let's go open it camera and now don't 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:49.339
 I'll look at the whole menu though if 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.610
 let's go through the menu there 

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:55.430
 will be new features and more have 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.969
 added this small in small test 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.629
 so as to activate the camera immediately 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.860
 frontal fact now if I or small 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.700
 front camera 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.220
 you will see 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.840
 the tiny webcam I'm picking up 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.290
 while I only recycle again 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.370
 you will see black but because the phone 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:21.880
 resting on the surface nothing for 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.160
 the moment these are the news I have 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.250
 found in the afternoon 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.460
 if I don't find others I'll do a 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.780
 another video hoping that over time 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:37.450
 also manages to have a device 8 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.470
 best record with this I salute you 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.470
 always from Rimini
