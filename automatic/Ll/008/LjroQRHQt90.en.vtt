00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
however my think i am kind of liking it

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.620 
however my think i am kind of liking it
in<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.260> middle<00:03:00.560> now<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:01.090> didn't<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.330> cut

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
in the middle now I didn't have to cut

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.330 
in the middle now I didn't have to cut
this<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:02.930> that's<00:03:03.230> another<00:03:03.500> thing<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:04.100> looks

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
this and that's another thing it looks

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.760 
this and that's another thing it looks
to<00:03:04.490> be<00:03:04.520> already<00:03:05.090> layered<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.230> way<00:03:06.410> that<00:03:06.590> I

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
to be already layered the way that I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.090 
to be already layered the way that I
prefer<00:03:07.220> my<00:03:07.250> units<00:03:07.850> to<00:03:08.060> look<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.959> mean<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.890> really

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
prefer my units to look I mean it really

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.190 
prefer my units to look I mean it really
does<00:03:10.370> let<00:03:11.060> me<00:03:11.120> straighten<00:03:11.390> myself<00:03:11.540> up<00:03:11.840> I<00:03:11.959> look

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.140 

so<00:03:15.200> I'm<00:03:15.500> definitely<00:03:15.739> liking<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.430> idea<00:03:16.580> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
so I'm definitely liking the idea of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.180 
so I'm definitely liking the idea of
that<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.140> pull<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.380> back<00:03:18.500> because<00:03:18.770> I<00:03:19.010> actually

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
that and pull it back because I actually

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.479 
that and pull it back because I actually
like<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> hot<00:03:20.030> side<00:03:20.360> it'll<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.989> whatever<00:03:21.770> I<00:03:22.100> mean
