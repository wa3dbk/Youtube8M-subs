favorite place again and right here is

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
favorite place again and right here is
the<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.710> barrel<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> bottom<00:01:50.970> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the the barrel that's at the bottom of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.319 
the the barrel that's at the bottom of
the<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.049> middle<00:01:52.320> shaft<00:01:52.729> this<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.790> makes<00:01:54.180> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the the middle shaft this is makes it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
the the middle shaft this is makes it
nice<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> easy<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.930> hold<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> when<00:01:55.680> you're

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
nice and easy to hold on to when you're

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
nice and easy to hold on to when you're
making<00:01:56.159> an<00:01:56.250> adjustment<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> lower

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
making an adjustment with that lower

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230 
making an adjustment with that lower
super<00:01:57.840> lock<00:01:58.020> portion<00:01:58.520> with<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.700> super<00:01:59.969> lock

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
super lock portion with that super lock

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.880 
super lock portion with that super lock
portion<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.110> graduated<00:02:01.590> markings

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
portion you have graduated markings

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.429 
portion you have graduated markings
again<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.329> simple<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.810> twisting<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
again and it's as simple as twisting it

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.490 
again and it's as simple as twisting it
in<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.979> lock<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.479> super<00:02:06.780> lock<00:02:06.930> mechanism

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in to lock it the super lock mechanism

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.290 
in to lock it the super lock mechanism
is<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.610> strongest<00:02:08.970> locking

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
is actually the strongest locking

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.070 
is actually the strongest locking
mechanism<00:02:09.750> available<00:02:09.840> it'll<00:02:10.800> hold<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.520> excess

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
mechanism available it'll hold in excess

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.830 
mechanism available it'll hold in excess
250<00:02:12.620> pounds<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.940> that's<00:02:14.150> why<00:02:14.270> they<00:02:14.390> put<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.720> on

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
250 pounds so that's why they put it on

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.930 
250 pounds so that's why they put it on
the<00:02:15.020> lower<00:02:15.470> section<00:02:15.740> once<00:02:16.550> you've<00:02:16.700> locked

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
the lower section once you've locked

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.330 
the lower section once you've locked
that<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.360> we'll<00:02:17.900> take<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.140> look<00:02:18.350> here<00:02:18.410> right<00:02:19.220> at

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
that in we'll take a look here right at

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.850 
that in we'll take a look here right at
these<00:02:19.460> numbers<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.360> see<00:02:20.630> that

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
these numbers and you can see that

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.610 
these numbers and you can see that
section<00:02:22.210> compresses<00:02:23.210> which<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.200> where<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
section compresses which is where the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.890 
section compresses which is where the
anti<00:02:24.920> shock<00:02:25.100> system<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:25.910> poll<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
anti shock system is in this poll on the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.530 
anti shock system is in this poll on the
lowest<00:02:27.230> section<00:02:27.530> closest<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.580> ground<00:02:28.820> so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
lowest section closest to the ground so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.180 
lowest section closest to the ground so
it<00:02:29.570> helps<00:02:29.870> soak<00:02:30.050> up<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.230> vibration<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.100> not

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
it helps soak up that vibration and not

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.270 
it helps soak up that vibration and not
transfer<00:02:31.610> through<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.910> your<00:02:31.970> wrist<00:02:33.280> alright

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
transfer through to your wrist alright

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.130 
transfer through to your wrist alright
so<00:02:34.460> all<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:34.820> down<00:02:35.000> at<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.270> tip<00:02:35.420> we've<00:02:35.900> got

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
so all the way down at the tip we've got

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.090 
so all the way down at the tip we've got
lay<00:02:36.740> Keys<00:02:36.970> carbide<00:02:37.970> flex<00:02:38.150> tip<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.830> these<00:02:39.830> come

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
lay Keys carbide flex tip and these come

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.190 
lay Keys carbide flex tip and these come
with<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.610> hard<00:02:40.790> pack<00:02:41.060> or<00:02:41.330> summer<00:02:41.630> basket<00:02:42.080> on

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.750 
with a hard pack or summer basket on
them<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.190> going<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.370> be<00:02:43.460> most<00:02:43.670> useful

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
them this is going to be most useful

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420 
them this is going to be most useful
when<00:02:44.210> you're<00:02:44.330> hiking<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.750> dry<00:02:45.050> conditions<00:02:45.430> if

when you're hiking in dry conditions if

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.910 
when you're hiking in dry conditions if
you<00:02:46.490> were<00:02:46.940> going<00:02:47.150> out<00:02:47.390> for<00:02:47.690> snowshoeing<00:02:48.020> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
you were going out for snowshoeing this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.130 
you were going out for snowshoeing this
basket<00:02:49.400> will<00:02:49.550> spin<00:02:50.030> right<00:02:50.240> off<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:51.110> can

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
basket will spin right off and you can

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.660 
basket will spin right off and you can
replace<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.680> with<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.890> snowshoe<00:02:52.280> basket

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
replace it with the snowshoe basket

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.750 
replace it with the snowshoe basket
which<00:02:52.820> is<00:02:52.970> sold<00:02:53.180> separately<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> loss<00:02:55.610> of
