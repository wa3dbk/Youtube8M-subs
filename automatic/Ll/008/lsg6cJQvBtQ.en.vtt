I<00:03:06.060> mean<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.920> bought<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.100> from<00:03:08.310> Aliexpress

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
I mean I bought here from Aliexpress

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.850 
I mean I bought here from Aliexpress
before<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.630> very<00:03:09.840> soft<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.470> ended<00:03:10.800> up

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
before that was very soft and ended up

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.180 
before that was very soft and ended up
being<00:03:11.130> terrible<00:03:11.880> hair<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> good

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
being terrible hair but I have a good

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.930 
being terrible hair but I have a good
feeling<00:03:14.519> about<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.510> if<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.620> was<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.250> can

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
feeling about this so if this was a can

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.250 
feeling about this so if this was a can
since<00:03:18.269> how<00:03:18.390> long<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.780> would<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.110> comes<00:03:19.980> down

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
since how long it would be comes down

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.520 
since how long it would be comes down
it's<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.610> right<00:03:23.610> here<00:03:24.140> that's<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.230> bit<00:03:25.380> like

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's like right here that's a bit like

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:39.900 
it's like right here that's a bit like
to<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.549> next<00:03:32.880> frontier

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.410 

this<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.240> 20<00:03:41.570> inches<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:46.550> hair<00:03:46.790> also<00:03:47.060> had

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
this is the 20 inches the hair also had

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.710 
this is the 20 inches the hair also had
a<00:03:48.130> weird<00:03:49.130> smell<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.740> that's<00:03:51.740> expected

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.860 

this<00:03:56.720> one<00:03:56.930> was<00:03:57.170> about<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.560> long<00:03:57.830> and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
this one was about this long and

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.600 
this one was about this long and
remember<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.020> length<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.620> when<00:04:01.250> it's

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
remember the length is when it's

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:09.220 
remember the length is when it's
stretched<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.890> 20<00:04:04.280> inches<00:04:08.170> that's<00:04:09.170> a

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
stretched this is 20 inches that's a

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.140 
stretched this is 20 inches that's a
great<00:04:09.440> length<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.890> does<00:04:10.520> my<00:04:10.640> first<00:04:10.820> time

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
great length to a does my first time

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.210 
great length to a does my first time
wearing<00:04:11.330> kinky<00:04:11.900> hair<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.560> I'm<00:04:12.800> here<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.100> I'm

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
wearing kinky hair so I'm here and I'm

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.790 
wearing kinky hair so I'm here and I'm
supposed<00:04:13.550> to<00:04:13.580> put<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.910> shortest<00:04:14.530> cuts<00:04:15.530> back

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
supposed to put the shortest cuts back

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:25.700 
supposed to put the shortest cuts back
on<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.580> bottom<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.270> then<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.510> longest<00:04:17.930> time

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:34.879 

surely<00:04:26.710> I'm<00:04:27.280> there<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:27.669> Friday<00:04:28.000> Finisterre

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.559 

does<00:04:35.889> this<00:04:36.190> one<00:04:36.490> I<00:04:36.759> see

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
does this one I see

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:43.499 
does this one I see
I<00:04:37.599> guess<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:39.069> longer<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.580> kid's<00:04:40.349> been<00:04:41.349> a<00:04:42.509> Bunco

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
I guess the longer a kid's been a Bunco

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:54.950 
I guess the longer a kid's been a Bunco
bar<00:04:44.849> but<00:04:46.050> here's<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.199> 22

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.350 

so<00:04:55.960> maybe<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.349> will<00:04:56.530> go<00:04:56.680> if<00:04:56.770> it's<00:04:56.949> not<00:04:57.360> you

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
so maybe this will go if it's not you

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.189 
so maybe this will go if it's not you
can<00:04:58.419> start<00:04:58.810> here<00:04:59.169> I<00:05:00.810> mean<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:01.930> don't<00:05:02.050> even

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.899 
can start here I mean you don't even
have<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.680> pick<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.979> curls<00:05:03.250> out<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.580> can<00:05:03.759> leave
