00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
inspired by tango text design I liked

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.250 
inspired by tango text design I liked
his<00:00:22.830> whole<00:00:23.010> idea<00:00:23.460> how<00:00:23.699> only<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.019> male

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
his whole idea how only the male

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.560 
his whole idea how only the male
villagers<00:00:25.800> could<00:00:25.949> like<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:26.460> up<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.180> into

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.910 
villagers could like go up the the into
the<00:00:27.660> water<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.710> so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the water and not the little one so

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.560 
the water and not the little one so
that's<00:00:29.039> good<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> filters<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.119> sorry<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
that's good a filters out that sorry I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.350

took<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:32.430> redesigned<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.270> my

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
took that and just redesigned it for my

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.540 
took that and just redesigned it for my
own<00:00:33.510> purpose<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
own purpose really and this is what I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.049 
own purpose really and this is what I
got

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
got

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.720 
got
when<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> redesigned<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
when I when I redesigned it and so it is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.990 
when I when I redesigned it and so it is
a<00:00:38.760> force<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.420> force<00:00:39.629> cell<00:00:40.100> as<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.820> see

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
a force the force cell as you can see

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
a force the force cell as you can see
you<00:00:42.149> can't<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.570> singular<00:00:43.079> cells<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.620> like

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
you can't do singular cells if you like

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
you can't do singular cells if you like
but<00:00:44.160> I've<00:00:44.340> chosen<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.000> four<00:00:45.210> cell<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:46.079> I've

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
but I've chosen a four cell now I've

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.590 
but I've chosen a four cell now I've

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
getting cooked because you know we don't

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.740 
getting cooked because you know we don't
want<00:01:56.579> thousands<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> village<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.479> freak

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
want thousands of village just freak

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
want thousands of village just freak
around<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
around down there but this is the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.749 
around down there but this is the
breeder<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.210> let's<00:02:00.570> quickly<00:02:01.350> go<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:02.460> over<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
breeder so let's quickly go go over it

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
breeder so let's quickly go go over it
real<00:02:02.909> quick<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.450> got<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> doors<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:04.079> here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
real quick so we got the doors up here

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.499 
real quick so we got the doors up here
which<00:02:04.530> make<00:02:04.740> them<00:02:04.979> breed<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:06.090> got<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> single

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
which make them breed we got a single

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.619 
which make them breed we got a single
chick<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.890> no<00:02:08.700> glass<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.330> because

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
chick in here but no glass there because

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.300 
chick in here but no glass there because
she<00:02:09.780> likes<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.080> walk<00:02:10.319> off<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:10.739> for<00:02:10.830> walkies

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
she likes to walk off and go for walkies

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.860 
she likes to walk off and go for walkies
so<00:02:11.550> somehow<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.300> got<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.540> key

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so somehow we got a key

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.930 
so somehow we got a key
in<00:02:13.080> there<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:14.099> what<00:02:14.310> I've<00:02:14.430> done<00:02:14.459> for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
in there and that's what I've done for

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.150 
in there and that's what I've done for
now<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:16.230> we'll<00:02:16.349> take<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.650> over<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.890> design

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
now but we'll take you over the design

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.430 
now but we'll take you over the design
really<00:02:17.489> quickly<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.540> we'll<00:02:18.780> start<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
really quickly so we'll start in the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.259 
really quickly so we'll start in the
actual<00:02:19.860> chamber<00:02:20.340> itself<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.790> let's<00:02:20.940> go<00:02:21.090> down

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
actual chamber itself so let's go down

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.900 
actual chamber itself so let's go down
in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> chamber<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.370> there's

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
in the chamber so as you can see there's

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.059 
in the chamber so as you can see there's
a<00:02:23.940> bunch<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.360> them<00:02:24.480> breeding<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.080> here<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.530> as

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
a bunch of them breeding in here and as

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.360 
a bunch of them breeding in here and as
they<00:02:26.310> push<00:02:27.030> themselves<00:02:27.540> out<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> edges

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
they push themselves out on to the edges

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
they push themselves out on to the edges
here<00:02:29.580> they<00:02:29.790> will<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.269> sucked<00:02:30.690> up<00:02:30.959> well

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
here they will get sucked up well

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.259 
here they will get sucked up well
they're<00:02:31.709> pretty<00:02:31.860> much<00:02:32.040> holding<00:02:32.400> spacebar<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
they're pretty much holding spacebar so

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.479 
they're pretty much holding spacebar so
now<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:33.810> hold<00:02:34.049> spacebar<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.680> sort<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.010> you

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
now if we hold spacebar we sort of you

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.770 
now if we hold spacebar we sort of you
know<00:02:35.610> go<00:02:35.790> through<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.120> water<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.629> that's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
know go through the water so that's

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
know go through the water so that's
what's<00:02:36.959> happening<00:02:37.440> right<00:02:37.500> now<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:38.040> every<00:02:38.220> time

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
what's happening right now on every time

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.059 
what's happening right now on every time
they<00:02:38.519> breathe<00:02:38.760> they<00:02:38.940> go<00:02:39.090> outwards<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.470> so

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
they breathe they go outwards and and so

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.800 
they breathe they go outwards and and so
we've<00:02:41.220> got<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> star<00:02:41.640> pattern<00:02:41.910> here<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.269> just

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
we've got a star pattern here so just

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.650 
we've got a star pattern here so just
the<00:02:42.959> edge<00:02:43.110> corners<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:44.519> water<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.209> when<00:02:45.540> they

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
the edge corners have water so when they

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.020 
the edge corners have water so when they
breed<00:02:45.870> enough<00:02:46.230> they<00:02:46.950> push<00:02:47.250> each<00:02:47.549> other<00:02:47.819> out

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
breed enough they push each other out

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.819 
breed enough they push each other out
pretty<00:02:48.360> much<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:48.959> they<00:02:49.049> just<00:02:49.230> go<00:02:49.410> up<00:02:49.590> and

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
pretty much and then they just go up and

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.880 
pretty much and then they just go up and
I<00:02:50.400> decided<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.970> take<00:02:51.269> them<00:02:51.480> over<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.079> down<00:02:52.290> so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I decided to take them over and down so

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.620 
I decided to take them over and down so
that's<00:02:53.010> quite<00:02:53.280> easy<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.670> use<00:02:53.940> science<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that's quite easy just use science and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.150 
that's quite easy just use science and
we've<00:02:55.049> got<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> water<00:02:55.470> source<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> middle

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
we've got a water source in the middle

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.309 
we've got a water source in the middle
pushing<00:02:56.549> right<00:02:56.700> out<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> edge<00:02:57.150> signs<00:02:58.079> on

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
pushing right out to the edge signs on

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.380 
pushing right out to the edge signs on
the<00:02:58.410> edge<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:59.160> as<00:02:59.459> they<00:02:59.730> come<00:02:59.940> out<00:02:59.970> they<00:03:00.360> just

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
the edge so as they come out they just

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.420 
the edge so as they come out they just
then<00:03:00.930> floor<00:03:01.590> off<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.190> they<00:03:02.489> go<00:03:02.640> down<00:03:02.760> into<00:03:03.000> I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
then floor off and they go down into I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.920 
then floor off and they go down into I
say<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.459> would<00:03:05.730> say<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.910> mini<00:03:06.150> sink<00:03:06.450> bowl<00:03:06.660> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
say I would say a mini sink bowl and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.350 
say I would say a mini sink bowl and
then<00:03:07.200> right<00:03:07.769> now<00:03:07.920> they<00:03:08.099> get<00:03:08.220> cooked<00:03:08.579> bed<00:03:08.790> for

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
then right now they get cooked bed for

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.030 
then right now they get cooked bed for
future<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> haven't<00:03:10.079> even<00:03:10.170> started<00:03:10.560> play<00:03:10.890> at

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
future I haven't even started play at
