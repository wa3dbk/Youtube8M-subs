really<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.210> tiny<00:01:00.690> wall<00:01:01.020> charger<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.620> think

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really really tiny wall charger I think

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.139 
really really tiny wall charger I think
this<00:01:01.949> may<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.129> smaller<00:01:02.550> than<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> wall

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
this may be smaller than the wall

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.080 
this may be smaller than the wall
charger<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> iphone<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
charger for the iphone and it is this is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.539 
charger for the iphone and it is this is
probably<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> smallest<00:01:07.110> wall<00:01:07.500> charger<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
probably the smallest wall charger that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.310 
probably the smallest wall charger that
I've<00:01:08.880> ever<00:01:09.119> seen<00:01:09.420> says<00:01:10.140> HP<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.659> we<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.960> a

I've ever seen says HP on it we have a
table<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.860> uses<00:01:14.810> let's<00:01:15.810> see<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
table that uses let's see what this is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
table that uses let's see what this is
using<00:01:16.680> micro<00:01:17.100> micro<00:01:17.790> USB<00:01:18.150> which<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> good<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
using micro micro USB which is good to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.320 
using micro micro USB which is good to
see<00:01:18.780> companies<00:01:19.290> starting<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.549> standardize<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
see companies starting to standardize to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.510 
see companies starting to standardize to
micro<00:01:21.540> USB<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.650> battery<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:24.180> size<00:01:25.520> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
micro USB and the battery is of size the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
micro USB and the battery is of size the
battery<00:01:26.820> doesn't<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.180> capacity<00:01:27.689> listed

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
battery doesn't of the capacity listed

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
battery doesn't of the capacity listed
on<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:28.979> 1,500<00:01:29.640> milliamp

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
on it we think that it's 1,500 milliamp

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.850 
on it we think that it's 1,500 milliamp
hours<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> coupled<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> AMOLED

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
hours so that coupled with the AMOLED

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
hours so that coupled with the AMOLED
display<00:01:32.159> should<00:01:32.340> mean<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.909> good<00:01:33.060> battery

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
display should mean really good battery

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
display should mean really good battery

messaging<00:02:28.020> let's<00:02:28.380> take<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> look<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.010> in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
messaging let's take a look at it in

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.270 
messaging let's take a look at it in
comparison<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.210> some<00:02:30.420> other<00:02:30.570> devices<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:32.070> here

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
comparison to some other devices so here

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.160 
comparison to some other devices so here
it<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.430> next<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.850> motorola<00:02:33.240> q<00:02:33.630> 9h<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.110> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it is next to the motorola q 9h and you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.690 
it is next to the motorola q 9h and you
can<00:02:34.290> kind<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.560> get<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> feel<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.160> how<00:02:35.310> similar

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
can kind of get a feel for how similar

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
can kind of get a feel for how similar
these<00:02:35.970> keyboards<00:02:36.270> are<00:02:36.690> they<00:02:37.080> look<00:02:37.290> almost

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
these keyboards are they look almost

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.920 
these keyboards are they look almost
exactly<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.280> same<00:02:38.400> although<00:02:39.210> in<00:02:39.330> terms<00:02:39.660> of

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
exactly the same although in terms of

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.770 
exactly the same although in terms of
the<00:02:40.470> keys<00:02:40.740> being<00:02:41.070> raised<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.850> q<00:02:42.090> 9h<00:02:42.420> has

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the keys being raised the q 9h has

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780 
the keys being raised the q 9h has
pretty<00:02:43.290> larger<00:02:43.740> bumps<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.130> all<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> keys<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
pretty larger bumps on all the keys and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.720 
pretty larger bumps on all the keys and
so<00:02:45.600> does<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.770> glisten<00:02:47.190> which<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.550> really

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
so does the the glisten which is really

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.600 
so does the the glisten which is really
nice<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.070> numbers<00:02:50.430> are

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
nice and actually the numbers are

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.000 
nice and actually the numbers are
located<00:02:51.060> in<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.360> same<00:02:51.630> area<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.710> glisten

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
located in the same area on the glisten

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.760 
located in the same area on the glisten
than<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.220> are<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.780> q<00:02:54.990> 9h<00:02:55.170> let's<00:02:55.620> take

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
than they are on the the q 9h let's take

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.410 
than they are on the the q 9h let's take
a<00:02:55.800> look<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.040> thickness<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.700> doesn't<00:02:57.270> have

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
a look at thickness this doesn't have

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.270 
a look at thickness this doesn't have
the<00:02:57.660> extended<00:02:58.020> battery<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.500> they<00:02:58.980> are<00:02:59.070> about

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
the extended battery and they are about

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.800 
the extended battery and they are about
the<00:02:59.340> same<00:02:59.640> thickness<00:02:59.910> I'd<00:03:00.240> say<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> glisten

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the same thickness I'd say the glisten

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.420 
the same thickness I'd say the glisten
is<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.960> little<00:03:01.260> bit<00:03:01.350> thicker<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.770> has<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.190> nice

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
is a little bit thicker it has this nice

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.930 
is a little bit thicker it has this nice
chrome<00:03:02.880> strip<00:03:03.360> down<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.660> side<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:05.760> take<00:03:05.910> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
look next to the HTC snap phone that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.070 
look next to the HTC snap phone that
doesn't<00:03:08.820> get<00:03:09.120> much<00:03:09.330> attention<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:09.960> it's

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
doesn't get much attention but it's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.330 
doesn't get much attention but it's
really<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.320> great<00:03:10.380> device<00:03:10.920> with<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> fantastic

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
really a great device with a fantastic

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.730 
really a great device with a fantastic
keyboard<00:03:12.180> this<00:03:12.840> device<00:03:13.110> doesn't<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.710> a

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
keyboard this device doesn't have a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.160 
keyboard this device doesn't have a
touch<00:03:14.010> screen<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.150> glisten<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.870> screen

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
touch screen like the glisten the screen

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.680 
touch screen like the glisten the screen
sizes<00:03:16.440> are<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.770> same<00:03:16.920> as<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.820> tell<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.570> we

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
sizes are the same as you can tell if we

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.960 
sizes are the same as you can tell if we
tilt<00:03:18.930> them<00:03:19.140> upwards<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.490> snap<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.760> an

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
tilt them upwards like so the snap is an

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.820 
tilt them upwards like so the snap is an
extremely<00:03:21.480> thin<00:03:21.840> device<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.410> glistens

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
extremely thin device so the glistens

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.520 
extremely thin device so the glistens
going<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.340> be<00:03:23.459> thicker<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:25.080> we<00:03:25.230> have<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.380> lot

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
going to be thicker so we have a lot
