00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.049
 unleashed and this is minecraft we are to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 day of texture pack that you know that the 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.860
 last week he lost a limit of 2700 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.680
 likes to take part 4 and I've seen 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.400
 which has climbed to 3500 is almost 1000 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.529
 likes more I find it a lot but 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.109
 that shows what is being done 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.779
 making or liking it and what 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 more more appreciation is worth this week is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 could go a long way because of problems 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 personal and others but has advanced 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 agree and good 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 if you are still convinced that you want 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.980
 we move forward with no texture pack 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.770
 I'm going to say 2,706 because I already thought 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.660
 Excessive, but I spend a lot of money 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.370
 I would like it to be 3000 likes if 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 It's great but I 'm telling you that with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 2500 I will do the next part worth 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.079
 so the goal would be 3,000 but 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.570
 with 2500 you have it, but I would like 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.890
 that reaching 3000 would be cool and good 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.590
 said that let's let's start 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.630
 good good good has been changed 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.640
 mainly there has not been a change in 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.159
 blocks of agreement do not change the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.470
 blocks for now put them in there are already 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.850
 changed since the rest has been maintained 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.700
 of things like what was already been 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.420
 kept in agreement what we have 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.610
 changed is the part of the mods not 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.170
 all a few if the missing that 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.740
 For example, the missing horse is missing 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.420
 the matchmaking is missing from line 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.909
 give the ideas please because we 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.649
 missing ideas for the ways we have 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.700
 decided that what has been the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.890
 villager 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.640
 we read suppressed from the nose it's worth it 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.219
 the piece of nose or tea that he had and in 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.420
 the face was horrible horrible it's worth not 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.369
 I wanted to change the suit so that 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.570
 this yesterday we can identify what 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.670
 is each worth at the time of commercial 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.200
 look at the eye the eye changes as you see 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 the eyelash eyelash there you have seen 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.610
 great and the emerald shine 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 and we have turned them into women of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.600
 according to the village plus villages for all 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.600
 he finally ended 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.200
 intellectual 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.610
 giving then in irak and scare and good 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.110
 We have different colors we have in 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.880
 change to hairstyles are a roll and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.239
 also the agreement cycle so it's 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.550
 a cell roll we give a touch to me 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.769
 what cell is the cicad, let alone 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.790
 but those pointy ears that had 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.890
 and then the woman's touch of agreement 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.739
 Well, we have it there, you see the different 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.859
 that there is what the texture of the 'big 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.129
 man 'in agreement as you see is more billet 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.390
 in some way and then apart as you see 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.780
 it's different, it's darkened 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.569
 quite a bit more yuyu and there 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.400
 is at the same time to the bee that record 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.230
 ice of a pokÃ©mon that had to be 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.000
 electrical and that was blue and was 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.290
 a bee, we wanted to give it that 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.549
 tone of agreement I do not remember the name 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.829
 is someone remembers that the zinc ones 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.360
 comments that would be great is worth that 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.640
 it's the blue-faced bee 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.300
 the brain we have decided to be an uncle 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.940
 horny a funny man from life 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.080
 Uruguay for a form is the bet 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.570
 tickets box 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.190
 and a bit of falling mayer that is 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.240
 who fears the birds and we see the most 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.040
 clearly here it is darker with a 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.400
 little bit and saying there we're going 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.630
 party of nothing rises that I take you good 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.630
 well let's go with the next 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.730
 the wolf but the boar of the wolf 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.920
 Dark 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.890
 and when his eyes change and he turns 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.349
 aggressive becomes clear so we can a 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.700
 little pig around here to make him 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.420
 say and she 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.099
 to her regarding the change of the eyes 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.170
 it becomes clear, that's a small thing 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.950
 failure that has but if we can all 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.950
 fix 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.020

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.330
 that we have had then that that 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.700
 we have to change it's worth but it 's just 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.470

 this fourth part of the texture pac are not 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.570
 Many I already tell you but it's because 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.030

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.590
 the rest of things and as well as please 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.910
