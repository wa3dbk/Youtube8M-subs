speed I start with the right hand real
basic<00:00:33.989> technique<00:00:34.440> basically<00:00:35.309> hold<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:35.969> your

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
basic technique basically hold all your

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
basic technique basically hold all your
fingers<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.630> straight<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.020> possible<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.829> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
fingers as straight as possible and you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.709 
fingers as straight as possible and you
bend<00:00:38.100> one<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> time<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:39.059> keeping<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
bend one at a time we're keeping all the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.569 
bend one at a time we're keeping all the
other<00:00:39.780> fingers<00:00:40.290> straight<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
other fingers straight it's actually a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.069 
other fingers straight it's actually a
little<00:00:41.760> hard<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.149> believe<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:42.960> not

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
little hard at first believe it or not

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
little hard at first believe it or not
but<00:00:43.789> it's<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.940> something<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.360> practice

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
but it's just something you practice

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 
but it's just something you practice
over<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.350> over<00:00:46.680> again<00:00:46.829> until<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.280> joints

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
over and over again until your joints

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.970 
over and over again until your joints
get<00:00:47.789> looser<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.270> looser<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.260> don't

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
get looser and looser and then I don't

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
get looser and looser and then I don't
know<00:00:50.070> exactly<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> does<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
know exactly what it does but it kind of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.510 
know exactly what it does but it kind of
gives<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.870> extra<00:00:52.379> snap<00:00:53.539> another<00:00:54.539> thing

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
gives you an extra snap another thing

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
gives you an extra snap another thing
when<00:00:56.520> you're<00:00:56.640> playing<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.460> 80s<00:00:59.460> rock

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.859 
front to back with my fingers I can only
go<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.659> fast<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:12.780> I'm

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
go so fast that way and so when I'm

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
go so fast that way and so when I'm
doing<00:01:13.020> metal<00:01:13.500> style<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.930> basically<00:01:15.930> go<00:01:16.340> back<00:01:17.340> to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500 
lock you get faster you know and then
it's<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.310> technique<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.120> apply<00:02:16.450> to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it's just a technique you can apply to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.949 
it's just a technique you can apply to
like<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> basic<00:02:17.350> chord<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:21.630> make<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.660> work

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
like a basic chord like make it work

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.520 
like a basic chord like make it work
like<00:02:23.230> that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.220 

left<00:02:26.530> hand<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> really<00:02:28.750> good<00:02:28.900> exercise

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
left hand this is a really good exercise

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
left hand this is a really good exercise
and<00:02:29.440> off<00:02:29.800> I'll<00:02:30.130> start<00:02:30.459> with<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:32.620> extra

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and off I'll start with just a extra

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.510 
and off I'll start with just a extra
technique<00:02:33.730> Billy<00:02:34.390> Sheehan<00:02:34.630> when<00:02:34.930> he<00:02:35.110> taps<00:02:35.520> he

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
technique Billy Sheehan when he taps he

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.280 
technique Billy Sheehan when he taps he
puts<00:02:36.760> his<00:02:36.880> middle<00:02:37.150> finger<00:02:37.450> elvers<00:02:37.810> index

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
puts his middle finger elvers index

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.590 
puts his middle finger elvers index
because<00:02:38.739> base<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.220> know<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.550> really<00:02:40.330> got<00:02:40.480> to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
because base you know it's really got to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.449 
because base you know it's really got to
use<00:02:40.690> your<00:02:40.870> strength<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.470> tap<00:02:44.190> gives<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.280> that

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
use your strength to tap gives you that

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.470 
use your strength to tap gives you that
extra<00:02:45.580> strength<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.930> exercise<00:02:47.320> I

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
extra strength so in this exercise I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.690 
extra strength so in this exercise I
start<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:50.200> put<00:02:50.380> your<00:02:50.560> left<00:02:50.739> hand<00:02:50.860> wherever<00:02:51.340> on
