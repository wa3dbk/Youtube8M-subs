00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.650
 hello to everyone this video on keddr.com 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.660
 and now we will look at the very 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 big revolution in the android world for everything 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.830
 the existence of android in my opinion 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.619
 This is of course an application with write 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.810
 whom we have been waiting for more than a year in this 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.420
 year google bought the company 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.250
 nik software to speed up the process 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.109
 exit snapseed for android and should 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.929
 say that it is not for nothing that reason 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.270
 the exact same app as on ios by 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.010
 at least I see that everything is the same 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.800
 the only thing that came out for ios today 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 updates and there added new features 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.550
 while there are no such functions here but 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280
 nevertheless all life used those 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 That here is and not complained this the most 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.559
 the best editor is probably for quick 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.420
 photo editing up there are them 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.280
 much but nevertheless I most often 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.340
 I use this very reason now 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.590
 you can proudly say that buying 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.609
 good smartphone with a good camera type 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 galaxy laptop 2 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.480
 you too can do very very 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.220
 cool processing for your shots 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 let's just briefly share now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
 about what is there 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.500
 functionality and what i use 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 most of all let's choose now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 some photo you can choose 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 immediately from the gallery or directly 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.130
 shoot on camera we'll pick from gallery 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.350
 anything that is already available at the very 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.480
 really like winning 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.520
 why then there 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.230
 The main thing now is just to see how everything is 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.110
 this is the work that's probably choose here 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.790
 such a photo click ok I just 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.890
 I will show features that more 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 all favor all so automatic right away 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 skip it because everything automatically 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 the settings are generally evil therefore 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.310
 actually don't like the boil format and 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.610
 so on 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.620
 nice link and jest stuff 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.110
 You can choose some points by 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.440
 first time telling you how it all 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.910
 do right here press the plus sign and 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.190
 add. now you can her 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.140
 adjust the camera clearly eye and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.110
 a window appears on top for you to see 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.480
 what are you tuning well actually on 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.010
 small screen I wash my food on smartphones 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.140
 make it hard enough therefore 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.330
 tablet go on this mini if ​​we want 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.970
 Something for sweet fly for example some 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.640
 some area then we just choose and 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.700
 and then choose such a gesture 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.300
 the brightness of the example is highlighted and and then 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.700
 contrast 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.230
 out of the crack if this saturation 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.750
 accordingly, you can choose very 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.090
 many points you can duplicate them for 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.950
 so that the same action 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.880
 performed for different photos click 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 ok 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.700
 go ahead very useful tab 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.860
 tuning is your own business pain 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.020
 most of the processing of all photos 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.570
 there are so many points here 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.430
 brightness with this all is clear just by 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.040
 jars right or left we it gets 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.780
 or add or remove also here 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.520
 have ambiance 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.709
 this is a very cool feature which 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.750
 black brightens and light does 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.750
 darker here now if we enter something 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.700
 You can achieve this effect like hd 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.320
 contact some photos especially 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.450
 if nature photograph it 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.000
 it's very, very cool 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.709
 the contrast itself is also clear 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.380
 just put a contrast on me very much 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.450
 like that this kind of function is 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.420
 and in other editors my only this 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.310
 They are here by such an algorithm very, very 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.989
 good works and 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.940
 therefore, the effect is very 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.459
 cool here we can saturation a little 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.040
 tidy up and then it turns out very 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.840
 beautiful and of course white balance if 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.520
 the photo is very yellow there and tidy up 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.940
 here now minus 9 looks just 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.370
 ok, press ok and move on 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.349
 we can take a picture if to 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.200
 For example, you want to correct the horizon and 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.160
 so on but in this case we have it 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.510
 done not immediately not quite standard 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.459
 therefore , you can also rotate here 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.530
 right or bluff we cancel this action 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.650
 because the ship in this photo 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.450
 do not need to go further dill 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.130
 im a photo to size if you 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.200
 for example, you want to run it in 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.690
 it is better to start instagram immediately 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.599
 one to one done like this 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.410
 way we get the card click ok and 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.390
 we have a square dtl most often I miss 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.830
 figure it out yourself further you can 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.480
 make photos black and white too 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.489
 very cool algorithm this is not easy 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.430
 erected done black and white you can 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.320
 choose also the script there is very 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.510
 cool filter drama 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.520
 he makes it like that 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.380
 It is best to use it for 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.600
 nature she draws very cool 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.640
 the sky here we can in use 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.470
 just tidy up here about 15 because 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.390
 that the faces are not very cool but 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.830
 also removes saturation so we 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.289
 add after using it 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.450
 saturation in the same filter and click 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.660
 ok, we get a card like this 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.020
 vintage is actually never 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.070
 I have a vintage effect 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.110
 cool grand grand grand 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.729
 if we photograph something completely 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.440
 usually it can also be made to 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.450
 cool with the help of such here 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.940
 then you can just indulge 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.180
 pick out arbitrarily some 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.419
 script but you can also twist like that 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.940
 the style here is a very very large range of 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.740
 its brightness contrast texture you can 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.930
 add you can remove you can choose 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.610
 texture of them there are several kinds and so 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.199
 further but this effect u remote control all 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.449
 rows cut only for some 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.389
 special purposes further we have 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.550
 focusing center we can choose what 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.530
 will be at the center of it is, by the way frames 1 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.630
 never use it flew ships 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.550
 Eledians here are very very cool 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.400
 if you know what you need and they need 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.500
 for when you are photographing something 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.900
 top down to the world of people cars and so 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.940
 then it turns out the effect and toy 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.440
 But for such things it’s better not 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.720
 use because very much 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.580
 poured and looks ugly 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.650
 that is, use only as directed. 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.960
 after which you can photograph 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.780
 save fry google plus of course 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.720
 because the application is now with us 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.520
 so called google plus google plus 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.460
 instagram here so its creative on 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.680
 bedroom this again i repeat on android 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.990
 one hundred percent is the best photo editor 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.669
 for me it is the best and on ios because 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.460
 that I use it more often than not 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.110
 advanced but most often it is necessary here 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.900
 something between a very large 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.190
 advancement and functionality and 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.099
 processing speeds right here 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.599
 enough for all customize something 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.520
 there are you can even manually point 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:22.320
 highlights lighten doing them more 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.510
 colorful and so on but at the same time 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.210
 everything happens very fast and the interface 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.970
 it is of course just fine because 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.680
 that here u choose the effect and you and you 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.919
 top bottom select function with wipes 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.710
 left and right make it more saturated 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.060
 Here is such a brief overview 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.099
 functionality report for android yet 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.479
 I repeat once again the exact same functions 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.289
 there is exactly the same functionality as 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.690
 and for ios 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.000
 In addition to several functions that are in part 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.919
 retro which added this today 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.509
 snap sit for friend tom by the way completely 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.810
 free is already available in google play 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.810
 more
