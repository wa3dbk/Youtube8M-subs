00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
jailbroken devices and obviously you

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.480 
jailbroken devices and obviously you

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
know it has a purpose it does seem that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.520 
know it has a purpose it does seem that
Apple<00:05:21.060> brought<00:05:21.390> this<00:05:21.600> whole<00:05:21.960> over-the-air

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
but also to make things a lot more

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.830 
but also to make things a lot more
difficult<00:05:31.890> for<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.250> dev<00:05:32.490> team<00:05:32.760> to<00:05:33.120> be<00:05:33.450> able<00:05:33.480> to

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
difficult for the dev team to be able to

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.630 
difficult for the dev team to be able to
jailbreak<00:05:34.020> devices<00:05:34.710> obviously<00:05:35.460> you<00:05:35.520> could

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
jailbreak devices obviously you could

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.750 
jailbreak devices obviously you could
