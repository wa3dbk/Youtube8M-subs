the goose T bar tie that on a couple of
towers<00:04:13.460> some<00:04:14.150> what<00:04:14.720> we<00:04:14.750> call<00:04:14.840> lately<00:04:15.260> hooded

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
towers some what we call lately hooded

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.890 
towers some what we call lately hooded
towers<00:04:15.890> being<00:04:16.220> four<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.330> we<00:04:17.480> tie<00:04:17.660> down<00:04:17.870> our
