 along the way almost in every summer context 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.869

 have a chance. to see the movies of poker which I have always been able to do 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.719
 express my point of view between a player of great satisfaction 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.109
 what signal do you think the presence of such important players 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.289
 in the final stages of such an important night tournament 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:35.079
 hey of poker and one of the flagship events of the real Italian season 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.609
 very good structure 25,000 starting bologna events 150 every hour xd 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.280
 the fracture we are a bit at night in going through 1000 2004 1005 3000 s 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.559
 feel a little the hurdler is a little off 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:53.379
 on the one hand it could make the easy vanni association idea for which like 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.939
 you see so many good saga players on the other end as rightly so 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.260
 it is such a beautiful and prestigious tournament that it has 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.900
 obviously obviously called up high level players for so long 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.530
 physiological and some of them arrived to the end so probably it is 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.899
 the union of both considerations that makes zohan 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.099
 the tables you see now left are really quality
