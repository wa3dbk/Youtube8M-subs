hi this Mike's focus with madcap logic

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:03.980 
hi this Mike's focus with madcap logic
and<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.330> going<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.540> show<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.780> how<00:00:03.929> we

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
and today I'm going to show you how we

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.930 
and today I'm going to show you how we
go<00:00:04.200> from<00:00:04.380> concept<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.890> completion<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.609> 3d

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
go from concept to completion of a 3d

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.480 
go from concept to completion of a 3d
animated<00:00:06.420> scene<00:00:06.750> this<00:00:07.529> isn't<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.340> any

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
animated scene this isn't how to in any

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.669 
animated scene this isn't how to in any
particular<00:00:08.730> aspect<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.570> 3d<00:00:09.840> animation<00:00:10.380> but

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
particular aspect of 3d animation but

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.530 
particular aspect of 3d animation but
more<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.460> general<00:00:11.820> overview<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
more so just a general overview of the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.959 
more so just a general overview of the
entire<00:00:12.660> process<00:00:13.200> from<00:00:13.410> start<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:14.009> end<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.910> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
entire process from start to end just to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.250 
entire process from start to end just to
show<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.360> all<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.690> involved<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.139> making

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
show you what all is involved in making

show you what all is involved in making
a<00:00:16.440> 3d<00:00:16.680> animation<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.660> go<00:00:21.320> first<00:00:22.320> all

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

is<00:00:27.060> create<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> 3d<00:00:27.420> character<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.650> also

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
is create the 3d character this is also

the<00:00:44.740> character<00:00:45.100> using<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.460> technique<00:00:45.820> called

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
the character using a technique called

the character using a technique called
polygonal<00:00:46.330> modeling

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.799 

the<00:00:51.280> trick<00:00:51.519> is<00:00:51.550> used<00:00:51.910> enough<00:00:52.149> vertices<00:00:52.629> when

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
the trick is used enough vertices when

the trick is used enough vertices when
building<00:00:53.109> the<00:00:53.260> model<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.710> give<00:00:53.829> an<00:00:53.949> accurate

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
representation of the character and to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.779 
representation of the character and to
allow<00:00:56.530> for<00:00:56.559> proper<00:00:56.890> deformation<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:57.730> the

characters joints but not too many
vertices<00:01:00.159> as<00:01:00.519> it<00:01:00.640> will<00:01:00.760> slow<00:01:00.969> down<00:01:01.000> the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
vertices as it will slow down the

onto<00:01:22.479> a<00:01:22.659> surface<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:24.189> can<00:01:24.310> think<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.700> like

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
onto a surface you can think of it like

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.730 
onto a surface you can think of it like
using<00:01:25.060> an<00:01:25.270> overhead<00:01:25.539> projector<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.380> project

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.710 
UVs are laid out I can go into Photoshop
and<00:01:42.280> paint<00:01:42.610> textures<00:01:43.000> for<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.270> character

and paint textures for the character

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.109 
and paint textures for the character
I'll<00:01:44.380> use<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.770> UV<00:01:45.069> layout<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.549> it<00:01:45.700> created<00:01:45.970> a

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
I'll use the UV layout that it created a

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'll use the UV layout that it created a

this<00:01:48.670> will<00:01:48.819> tell<00:01:49.000> me<00:01:49.090> where<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.299> need<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.630> paint

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
this will tell me where I need to paint

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.199 
this will tell me where I need to paint
once<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.069> texture<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:51.429> painted<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:51.939> can<00:01:52.090> go

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
once the texture is painted I can go

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:53.999 
once the texture is painted I can go
back<00:01:52.329> into<00:01:52.539> my<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.959> apply<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.319> texture<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.979> a

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
back into my and apply the texture to a

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.889 
back into my and apply the texture to a
material<00:01:54.579> and<00:01:54.700> assign<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.179> material<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
material and assign the material to the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.469 
material and assign the material to the
character<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:57.429> this<00:01:57.610> point<00:01:57.849> I've<00:01:58.030> only<00:01:58.179> built

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
character to this point I've only built

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.569 
character to this point I've only built
a<00:01:58.599> static<00:01:58.959> model<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.319> the<00:01:59.409> character<00:01:59.799> there's

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
a static model of the character there's

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.010 
a static model of the character there's
currently<00:02:00.970> no<00:02:01.060> way<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.450> move<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:01.780> character

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
currently no way to move the character

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.620 
currently no way to move the character
or<00:02:02.289> deform<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.799> so<00:02:03.579> this<00:02:03.939> is<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.149> next<00:02:04.450> step

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
or deform it so this is the next step

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.649 
or deform it so this is the next step
adding<00:02:05.409> animation<00:02:06.009> controls<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:07.270> step<00:02:07.509> is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
adding animation controls this step is

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.150 
adding animation controls this step is
often<00:02:08.049> referred<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.380> as<00:02:08.530> rigging<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.069> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
often referred to as rigging in the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.940 
often referred to as rigging in the
character<00:02:09.690> I'll<00:02:10.690> start<00:02:11.470> by<00:02:11.560> using<00:02:11.739> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
character I'll start by using the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
character I'll start by using the
skeleton<00:02:12.489> tool<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.910> draw<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.150> skeleton<00:02:13.690> inside

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
skeleton tool to draw a skeleton inside

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.150 
skeleton tool to draw a skeleton inside
the<00:02:14.170> character

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.220 

this<00:02:18.730> will<00:02:18.910> define<00:02:19.210> all<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.540> joints<00:02:19.930> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
this will define all the joints and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.150 
this will define all the joints and
pivot<00:02:20.500> points<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.950> character

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.290 

after<00:02:25.160> establishing<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:25.880> all<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> joints

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
after establishing where all the joints

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.780 
after establishing where all the joints
will<00:02:26.510> go<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.590> next<00:02:27.740> step<00:02:28.040> is<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.340> animation

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
will go the next step is that animation

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.430 
will go the next step is that animation
controls<00:02:29.240> on<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.540> those<00:02:29.660> joints<00:02:30.110> which<00:02:30.290> will

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
controls on to those joints which will

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960 
controls on to those joints which will
make<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.620> easier<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.070> select<00:02:31.430> them<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.850> move

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
make it easier to select them and move

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.390 
make it easier to select them and move
them<00:02:32.000> around

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.490 

once<00:02:40.209> controls<00:02:40.629> are<00:02:40.780> created<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.230> all<00:02:41.379> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
once controls are created for all the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.380 
once controls are created for all the
joints<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.129> next<00:02:42.400> step<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.819> attach<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
joints the next step is to attach a

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.089 
joints the next step is to attach a
model<00:02:43.689> to<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> character<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> skeleton

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
model to the character to the skeleton

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.970 
model to the character to the skeleton
using<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.489> process<00:02:45.730> called<00:02:45.939> skinning<00:02:46.829> first<00:02:47.829> I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
using a process called skinning first I

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.619 
using a process called skinning first I
select<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.430> joints<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.849> character<00:02:49.269> then

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
select the joints of the character then

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.679 
select the joints of the character then
the<00:02:49.750> skin<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.349> make<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.860> connection<00:02:51.689> after

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
and working together I'll also polish

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.100

haven't finished yet once all this is
done<00:05:49.900> this<00:05:50.169> is<00:05:50.229> what<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.590> final<00:05:50.800> animation

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
done this is what the final animation

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.659 
done this is what the final animation
looks<00:05:51.610> like<00:05:51.909> that's<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.229> art<00:05:53.800> is<00:05:54.099> successful

you can see as I add lights it starts to

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.749 
you can see as I add lights it starts to
build<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.710> look<00:06:25.860> in<00:06:26.009> the<00:06:26.099> field<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.490> scene
