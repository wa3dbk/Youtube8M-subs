00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.009
 so hello and welcome to us 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.400
 again at tariftipp.de we want today 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.830
 two very interesting devices 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.469
 compare with each other and that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 in terms of their performance 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.400
 we could already see it is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.010
 for samsung devices namely once here 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.439
 on the left side the Samsung galaxy 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.820
 On the right side next to it the brother without 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.019
 So lte samsung galaxy s3 these 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.059
 Both devices have been around already 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.070
 but some time in the market belong 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 about the creme de la creme 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 android smartphones on what the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.829
 they have done 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.460
 so far top seats occupied at least 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 the galaxy s3 that we already have 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.820
 could test in this regard 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.579
 So today the question is if that is 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 gets in here on the left side 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.350
 some way of doing something 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.520
 Mensch marktcheck performs better 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 should not be because 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.689
 this anti check yes no 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.520
 data connection evaluated but only the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.780
 pure hardware performance that is the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.270
 ncp check made 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.310
 it was a ram memory access 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.250
 simulated and executed sd-cards 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.189
 access and finally the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.369
 graphic performance simulated 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.740
 on the paper are both devices of the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.380
 hardware outfit almost ident 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.200
 only difference is that the lte 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 Model probably because it is easy 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 a little newer is with two gigabytes 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.439
 ram is delivered so the smaller 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.220
 the model without a lte must with one 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.720
 gigabyte ram get along, though 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.750
 honestly 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.370
 in use one hardly notices so 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 it is just like that when playing it 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.220
 to be programmed as well 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.890
 for smaller devices that are not so much 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.030
 ram and of course 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.770
 still have to run well and fluently 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.720
 so you see we are already at the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:14.100
 graphical checks I have that first 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 lte device started and then the s3 without 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.280
 lte 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.600
 it seems to me that this 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.540
 time difference to start it always 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.770
 still present in the same way 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.890
 if I'm not wrong 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.070
 should almost equal 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.020
 identical values ​​come out 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:39.260
 now both are already doing the sd 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.260
 card to test 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.709
 where I have to say that the two 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.200
 devices are not identical SD cards 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.880
 micro sd cards are so light 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.360
 that may be different 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.209
 Test in this respect a very small bit 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.870
 different from now on so provided 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:09.050
 both devices finished here you can see that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:15.180
 lte device comes to 15 1986 points that 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:19.049
 it's three without lte on 616 1005 thats 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.519
 almost identical values ​​as one would expect 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.590
 Must say if you are on tour now and then 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.390
 tried it out if you find out 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.519
 that actually even if you do that now 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.570
 again, the test would be easy 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.790
 would run again 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.950
 in fact, the numbers are always such 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.720
 So a little bit different 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.830
 You should not do that too much now 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.709
 put on the gold scale 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.060
 in fact, they are more or less 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.780
 identical devices we can do this here 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.360
 also see again 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.040
 here the device is at 14 fifth place 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.740
 and here just so 15 in 1186 for the three 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.170
 with lte 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.150
 16,000 5 for the device without lte so 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 almost identical that means ultimately 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.080
 who would opt for one of the two 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.360
 can decide completely from 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.070
 to be guided by the prices or even by 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.850
 the question of whether one wants now lte 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.550
 Yes or no 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.460
 If you want to have lunch you should 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.090
 moreover, the left device is now gripping the left 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.820
 that's from the data otherwise the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.040
 rest three identical when on lte 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.680
 can do without or not that 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.410
 additional money for an hour tariff 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.390
 you want to spend with the samsung 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.030
 galaxy s3 still very well served 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.000
 that was it from us on tariftipp de 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.370
 you will find tests of these both devices and 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.840
 now there is another benchmark test from 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.840
 tariftipp.de until then bye
