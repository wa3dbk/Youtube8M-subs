00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
hand if you condition without a ball its

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.760 
hand if you condition without a ball its
misery<00:02:54.989> isn't<00:02:55.530> it

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770

to something that's up and down and
we'll<00:03:28.709> go<00:03:28.860> as<00:03:28.980> long<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.459> think<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.970> get

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
we'll go as long as I think I can get

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.729 
we'll go as long as I think I can get
them<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.239> go<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.989> then<00:03:31.080> I'll<00:03:31.200> break<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.620> down

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
them to go and then I'll break it down

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.580 
them to go and then I'll break it down
and<00:03:31.950> we'll<00:03:32.040> do<00:03:32.160> something<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.610> half<00:03:32.760> court

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and we'll do something in the half court

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.660 
and we'll do something in the half court
because<00:03:34.590> what<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.799> don't<00:03:34.890> ever<00:03:35.190> want<00:03:35.459> them<00:03:35.580> to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
because what I don't ever want them to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.370 
because what I don't ever want them to
do<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.330> okay<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.660> go<00:03:36.900> half<00:03:37.080> speed

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
do is think it's okay to go half speed

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.740 
do is think it's okay to go half speed
because<00:03:37.709> I'm<00:03:37.860> exhausted<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:39.150> I'm<00:03:39.330> giving<00:03:39.690> them

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
because I'm exhausted so I'm giving them

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.170
