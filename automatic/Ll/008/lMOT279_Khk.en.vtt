 little Brazil but where has language 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.210

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.280
 Brazil

 in Portuguese brazil near what will you get 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.420
 to appear another bar here we go 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.450
 wait 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.670
 will always give a slice probably 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.870
 It's going to be in your name does not mean that 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.240
 neighborhood 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.910
 this first time here and will not 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.380
 probably worried about my 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.000
 because I 'm not connected to the 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.480
 but it will continue to load 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.150
 we worry to be stopped by a 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.120
 time of this home that already carries and 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.340
 when we have this option here 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.530
 it will fully charge that 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.720
 when you are switching to your cell phone 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:22.890
 I do not know if it will restart again, it will start 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.690
 to download the link and when you have 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.730
 near the end I probably think 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.980
 which is between 80 and 90 70 there it goes 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.760
 pay everything but do not know there and will carry 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.060
 alone in your occupation because I do not know 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.140
 recognize everything and will start installing 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.740
 automatically and after installation 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.610
 it will ask you to access the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.460
 Settings for your cell phone 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.450

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.820
