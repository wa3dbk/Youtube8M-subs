00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.729

 green 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.809
 to mention earlier in the file at the crisis of the disc tested 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:57.039
 also had an impact on festivals 40 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.699
 artists put in mind tend to compensate by increasing their 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.129
 hide it can be hard sata the help of posting besides this such the 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.229
 programming so everyone you're still a small structure 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.149
 it's still an association sapa been very hard 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:14.009
 it's always complicated but for 100 euros of its account of the limits the 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:17.549
 most expensive artists and we come up with% and posted heads 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.150
 accompanied by discovery to try to balance can make a budget 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.059
 reasonable 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:25.110

 the website of the bbc 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.180
 a bit frustrating but maybe it's okay 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.819

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.999
 festival 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.139
 it's because his uncle, on the contrary, is rather comfortable 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.499
 since the small bench is a good launch for the tenth anniversary 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:51.370
 and we want to keep this capacity anyway we will not go 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:52.650
 not increase 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.650
 it is essential to preserve it is this conviviality account that we want 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.599
