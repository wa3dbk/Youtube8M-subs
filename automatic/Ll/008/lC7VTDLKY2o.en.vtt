our<00:00:56.410> first<00:00:56.590> couple<00:00:56.920> systems<00:00:57.070> that<00:00:57.340> we<00:00:57.430> built

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
our first couple systems that we built

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.190 
our first couple systems that we built
and<00:00:57.970> compared<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.300> what<00:00:58.390> we<00:00:58.480> build<00:00:58.690> now<00:00:58.870> are

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
and compared to what we build now are

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200 
and compared to what we build now are
just<00:00:59.920> totally<00:01:00.550> different<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.059> they<00:01:01.150> were

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
just totally different and they were

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.780 
just totally different and they were
extremely<00:01:01.900> rough<00:01:02.800> actually<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:03.610> first

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
extremely rough actually the first

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.150 
extremely rough actually the first
version<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.330> still<00:01:04.570> have<00:01:04.809> but<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.560> got<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:05.950> stored

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
version I still have but I got it stored

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.770 
version I still have but I got it stored
away<00:01:06.280> someday<00:01:06.790> I<00:01:06.820> might<00:01:07.030> bring<00:01:07.270> that<00:01:07.420> back<00:01:07.600> out

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
away someday I might bring that back out

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.999 
away someday I might bring that back out
just<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.140> prove<00:01:08.290> that<00:01:08.350> I<00:01:08.500> actually<00:01:08.680> brewed

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009

to<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.110> larger<00:02:14.410> system<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.400> they<00:02:15.520> use<00:02:15.670> our

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
to a larger system and then they use our

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.490 
to a larger system and then they use our
system<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> pilot<00:02:16.540> system<00:02:16.810> later<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.410> do

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
system as a pilot system later on to do

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.470 
system as a pilot system later on to do
their<00:02:17.650> test<00:02:17.830> batches<00:02:18.040> on<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:19.090> our<00:02:19.120> four<00:02:19.330> main

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
their test batches on so our four main

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.140 
their test batches on so our four main
systems<00:02:19.900> consist<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.470> two<00:02:20.620> burner<00:02:21.150> two

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
systems consist of a two burner two

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.339 
systems consist of a two burner two
different<00:02:22.480> versions<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.959> three<00:02:23.230> burner

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
different versions of a three burner

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.680 
different versions of a three burner
system<00:02:23.740> and<00:02:24.160> then<00:02:24.340> our<00:02:24.550> double<00:02:25.090> batch<00:02:25.240> four

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
system and then our double batch four

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.050 
system and then our double batch four
burner<00:02:25.870> system<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:27.040> our<00:02:27.069> double<00:02:27.700> batch<00:02:27.849> four

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
burner system so our double batch four

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.089 
burner system so our double batch four
four<00:02:28.420> burner<00:02:28.599> system<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:29.050> what<00:02:29.170> we<00:02:29.319> we<00:02:29.860> sell

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
four burner system is what we we sell

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.600 
four burner system is what we we sell
the<00:02:30.220> most

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
the most

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.790 
the most
basically<00:02:31.090> you're<00:02:31.870> able<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.140> brew<00:02:32.440> two

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
basically you're able to brew two

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.160 
basically you're able to brew two
batches<00:02:33.250> at<00:02:33.430> one<00:02:33.580> time<00:02:33.849> on<00:02:34.180> that<00:02:34.780> system

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
batches at one time on that system

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.230 
batches at one time on that system
there's<00:02:35.620> no<00:02:35.740> hot<00:02:35.920> liquor<00:02:36.130> tank<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.030> all<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
there's no hot liquor tank so all the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.240 
there's no hot liquor tank so all the
hot<00:02:37.390> water<00:02:37.569> comes<00:02:37.660> from<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.590> tankless<00:02:39.069> hot

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
hot water comes from a tankless hot

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.010 
hot water comes from a tankless hot
water<00:02:39.310> heater<00:02:39.700> an<00:02:40.060> on-demand

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
water heater an on-demand

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.380 
water heater an on-demand
hot-water<00:02:41.680> heater<00:02:42.010> mounted<00:02:42.610> near<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.030> system

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
hot-water heater mounted near the system

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.040 
hot-water heater mounted near the system
and<00:02:44.020> allows<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.340> basically<00:02:46.090> have<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.840> mash

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
and allows you to basically have to mash

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.260 
and allows you to basically have to mash
kettles<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.340> boil<00:02:48.550> kettles<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.120> at<00:02:49.210> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
kettles and to boil kettles go on at the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.830 
kettles and to boil kettles go on at the
same<00:02:49.480> time<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.680> actually<00:02:51.130> brew<00:02:51.970> two

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
same time you can actually brew two

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.110 
same time you can actually brew two
beers<00:02:53.140> at<00:02:53.530> two<00:02:53.920> different<00:02:54.100> beers<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.910> same

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
beers at two different beers at the same

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.660 
beers at two different beers at the same
time<00:02:55.330> or<00:02:55.570> have<00:02:55.810> one<00:02:56.560> main<00:02:56.830> beer<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.400> blend

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
time or have one main beer and blend

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.730 
time or have one main beer and blend
them<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.970> fermenter<00:02:58.330> in<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> end<00:02:59.470> and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
them in the fermenter in the end and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.400 
them in the fermenter in the end and
then<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.600> little<00:03:01.750> two<00:03:01.900> burner<00:03:02.140> system

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
then in the little two burner system

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.100 
then in the little two burner system
that<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.800> had<00:03:02.980> mainly<00:03:03.720> directed<00:03:04.720> towards<00:03:04.990> the

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
that we had mainly directed towards the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.030 
that we had mainly directed towards the
home<00:03:05.260> brewer<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:06.460> based<00:03:06.670> on<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.690> same

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
home brewer it's based on the same

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.710 
home brewer it's based on the same
principle<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.880> four<00:03:10.060> burner<00:03:10.240> system<00:03:10.450> but

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
principle as the four burner system but

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.350 
principle as the four burner system but
just<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.960> smaller<00:03:11.260> version<00:03:11.350> or<00:03:11.860> half<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.040> size

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
just a smaller version or half the size

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.550 
just a smaller version or half the size
so<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:13.690> runs<00:03:13.900> off<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.080> tankless<00:03:14.440> hot

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
so and that runs off a tankless hot

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.620 
so and that runs off a tankless hot
water<00:03:14.620> heater<00:03:14.980> as<00:03:15.160> well<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.240> that<00:03:16.390> comes

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
water heater as well and that comes

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.300 
water heater as well and that comes
complete<00:03:17.020> everything<00:03:17.350> on<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.710> two<00:03:18.040> burner

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
complete everything on that two burner

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.830 
complete everything on that two burner
is<00:03:18.460> a<00:03:18.490> complete<00:03:18.970> system<00:03:19.300> for<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> home<00:03:19.630> brewer

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
is a complete system for the home brewer

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.890 
is a complete system for the home brewer
the<00:03:20.740> other<00:03:20.860> ones<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.580> we<00:03:21.700> sell<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.150> there's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
the other ones that we sell the there's

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.960 
the other ones that we sell the there's
a<00:03:22.960> small<00:03:23.260> version<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.040> three<00:03:24.370> burner<00:03:24.490> in<00:03:24.850> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
a small version of a three burner in a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.880 
a small version of a three burner in a
small<00:03:25.360> bigger<00:03:25.900> version<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.560> three<00:03:26.740> burner

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
small bigger version of a three burner

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.560 
small bigger version of a three burner
so<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.850> only<00:03:27.970> difference<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.570> those<00:03:28.840> are

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
so the only difference is on those are

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.970 
so the only difference is on those are
basically<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.690> size<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.560> frame<00:03:32.770> is<00:03:32.950> a

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
basically the size of the frame is a

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.110 
basically the size of the frame is a
little<00:03:33.040> bit<00:03:33.280> bigger<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.700> bigger<00:03:33.880> system

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
little bit bigger on the bigger system

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.450 
little bit bigger on the bigger system
and<00:03:34.510> has<00:03:34.930> larger<00:03:35.290> burners<00:03:35.680> to<00:03:35.860> accommodate

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
and has larger burners to accommodate

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.730 
and has larger burners to accommodate
larger<00:03:36.880> kettles<00:03:37.230> actually<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.380> systems<00:03:38.710> that

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
larger kettles actually the systems that

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.860 
larger kettles actually the systems that
we<00:03:38.920> create<00:03:39.270> obviously<00:03:40.270> with<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.630> hundred

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
we create obviously with the hundred

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.570 
we create obviously with the hundred
gallon<00:03:41.080> kettles<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.530> see<00:03:41.740> here<00:03:42.040> you

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
gallon kettles that you see here you

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.770 
gallon kettles that you see here you
know<00:03:42.670> you're<00:03:42.820> able<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.120> do<00:03:43.240> two<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> half

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
know you're able to do two and a half

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.840 
know you're able to do two and a half
barrels<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.530> beer<00:03:44.770> on<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.250> three<00:03:45.670> burner
