itrip<00:01:35.100> Alana<00:01:35.490> widths<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.790> took<00:01:38.970> three

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
itrip Alana widths and they took three

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.940 
itrip Alana widths and they took three
straight<00:01:39.720> hits<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:42.439> when<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.470> said<00:01:43.710> thought

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
straight hits and when I said thought

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
straight hits and when I said thought
about<00:01:44.159> him<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.759> independently<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.720> thought<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
about him to independently I thought it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
about him to independently I thought it
was<00:01:46.229> gonna<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.710> one-time<00:01:47.220> thing<00:01:47.490> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
was gonna be like a one-time thing but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
was gonna be like a one-time thing but
apparently<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:49.200> turned<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.560> three<00:01:50.009> minutes

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
apparently it turned out three minutes

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.719 
apparently it turned out three minutes
for<00:01:50.490> entire<00:01:50.759> match<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:52.040> this<00:01:53.040> brings<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.430> 12

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
for entire match so this brings up 12

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.039 
for entire match so this brings up 12
table<00:01:54.149> um<00:01:55.759> most<00:01:56.759> people<00:01:57.030> thought<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.240> your

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049

talks<00:03:31.500> about<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.100> we<00:03:32.489> didn't<00:03:32.730> know<00:03:32.850> how<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
talks about it but we didn't know how to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.280 
talks about it but we didn't know how to
do<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.330> just<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.570> one<00:03:33.720> time<00:03:33.959> thing<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.230> know

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
do it just for one time thing I know

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.960 
do it just for one time thing I know
because<00:03:35.130> that's<00:03:35.459> why<00:03:35.610> when<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.820> talk<00:03:35.940> about

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
because that's why when you talk about

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.940 
because that's why when you talk about
it<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.270> then<00:03:36.420> they<00:03:36.630> pretty<00:03:36.959> much<00:03:37.050> bring<00:03:37.739> water

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
it but then they pretty much bring water

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.500 
it but then they pretty much bring water
to<00:03:38.070> table<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.580> explain<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> more<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.360> we

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
to table and explain the more that we

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.729

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
should why I'm thinking about it now I

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.010 
should why I'm thinking about it now I
think<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.250> need<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.489> bill<00:03:41.640> t<00:03:41.850> will<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:42.209> like<00:03:42.720> I

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020
