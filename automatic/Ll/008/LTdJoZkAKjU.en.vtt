00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.190 
channel and this is by far one of the
most<00:01:28.409> ridiculous<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.340> probably<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> hardest

most ridiculous and probably the hardest

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.520 
most ridiculous and probably the hardest
how<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.439> sir<00:01:33.110> how<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.290> supposed<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
how are you sir how are you supposed to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.760 
how are you sir how are you supposed to
open<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> box<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.400> cereal<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.850> these<00:01:36.210> things

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
I think the best technique is just to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
I think the best technique is just to
tear<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
