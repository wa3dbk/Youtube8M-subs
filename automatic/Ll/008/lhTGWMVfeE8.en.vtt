 and then I just talk on the key 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.850
 I personally find it the most awkward way to Kaatsheuvel 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.060
 nevertheless you cannot personally be more convenient 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.209

 kind of scenes 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.229
 entertainment weekly for two days 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 she became the better chances 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:44.020
 this one used for the space bar and that kind of own tracks from beating anp 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.849
 it seems to me that way 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 let's let it go ourselves 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 and I just don't go on all the time 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:59.099
 I just do all the text I have it together I make sure that there is not 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.879
 2 himself says he comes side by side 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.289

 and and TV if you have two yards for the v60 dashes 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.799
 you can see that i say 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.469
 also find no difference about the list to be really absurdly most critical 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.179
 it seems a bit different 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:27.759
 yes it is hard to find public and also just misunderstand other patterns 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.449
 r 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.559
 we spend the night 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:30.300

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 the 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.940
 then you can here 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.939
 what a hedge this piece of food is with 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.989
 adhesive strips that are the largest 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.299
 and i have this piece it is just hard to clean up 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.159
 the packages 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.309

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.509

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.340
 I was not really behind so the size would have liked Philip 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.139
 I had the idea that it was inside 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.960
 I decided to test the boxes and the posts that he uses 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.990
 but you don't know 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.160
