00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
like I think if I was any bigger I
probably<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.619> fit<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.830> their<00:01:10.950> breasts

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.760 
so a couple months back I place an order
on<00:02:06.360> their<00:02:06.479> website<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.500> went<00:02:07.649> to

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
on their website because when we went to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.169 
on their website because when we went to
the<00:02:07.860> store<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.190> didn't<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.520> anything<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the store they didn't have anything and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.130 
the store they didn't have anything and
my<00:02:09.390> size<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.810> color

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
my size and color

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
my size and color
because<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.800> opened<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.400> was<00:02:11.490> sold

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
because he just opened and it was sold

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820 
because he just opened and it was sold
out<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.600> I<00:02:12.630> thought<00:02:13.080> why<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.230> place<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.650> order

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
out so I thought why not place an order

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.390 
out so I thought why not place an order
on<00:02:13.950> their<00:02:14.069> website<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:16.319> took<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.890> really

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
on their website and it took a really

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.860 
on their website and it took a really
long<00:02:17.580> time<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.120> kind<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.360> mail<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.600> paid

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
long time for the kind of mail I paid

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.720 
long time for the kind of mail I paid
for<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.350> week-long<00:02:19.800> shipping<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.370> handling

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
for like week-long shipping and handling

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.640 
for like week-long shipping and handling
which<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.330> know<00:02:21.450> isn't<00:02:21.959> always<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.500> most

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
which you know isn't always the most

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.990 
which you know isn't always the most
expensive<00:02:22.920> option<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.700> probably<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
expensive option I think is probably the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.330 
expensive option I think is probably the
cheapest<00:02:24.360> at<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.569> time<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.950> took<00:02:26.160> them

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
cheapest at the time but it took them

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
cheapest at the time but it took them
about<00:02:26.550> two<00:02:27.060> weeks<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.510> pack<00:02:27.780> my<00:02:28.020> order<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.560> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
about two weeks to pack my order and I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.449 
about two weeks to pack my order and I
don't<00:02:28.650> know<00:02:28.770> if<00:02:28.830> that's<00:02:28.950> cuz<00:02:29.070> they<00:02:29.130> were<00:02:29.250> sold

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.560 
because while I have ordered them before
I<00:06:10.930> think<00:06:11.320> once<00:06:11.590> last<00:06:12.370> year<00:06:12.550> for<00:06:13.030> Christmas<00:06:13.390> I

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
I think once last year for Christmas I

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.050 
I think once last year for Christmas I
ordered<00:06:13.840> a<00:06:14.080> JAMA<00:06:14.710> site<00:06:14.950> and<00:06:15.160> it<00:06:15.370> came<00:06:15.520> perfect

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060
