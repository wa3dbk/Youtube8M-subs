00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.340
 About 14 plant building materials ceramics 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.340
 I can do it 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.850
 First is the tile. 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.240
 What's called "Ibushi tile" 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.210
 What is a foreign film 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.070
 The glaze is over 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:33.280
 This applies the main baking reservation to the surface of the product 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:37.270
 But it is again fired to you there is a kind of such a person to obtain a variety of color tone of the next to the tile strength 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.780
 Flexural load of clay tiles is 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.330
 In桟瓦

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.310
 1500 Newton or more 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:50.980
 It is determined to be more than 600 nipples with tiled tiles 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.980
 Please remember firmly this number 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:06.810
 It is also a translation glaze, but by painting this 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 A glassy thin film is effective for rescue from the surface and reducing sugar water 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.990
 Glazed tiles 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.320
 Or usually painted on tiles etc 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.740
 Next is the type and nature of the tile 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.340
 First of all as classification 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.860
 Second base This is one of the porcelain system 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.850
 This is what disciplining Stone 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.299
 Mitaka 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:44.510
 This represents the pottery type 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:47.180
 The water absorption rate is determined to be less than 10% for 1% or less and 50% or less for 3% for types. 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.100
 Although it is the material of the governor 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.000
 One bowl is dense and not absorbent 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:01.840
 I will emit a staring sound if I hit it 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.330
 Even if the dough is hard and there is no water absorbency, the amount of the second base is very small 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.369
 Says 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:11.630
 Mishima has a water absorption property by the attack and defense of the fabric. 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:21.980
 It does not issue a star sound beating 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:23.060
 The purpose is to use the whole body of the exterior tile car as a crafted drum etc. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.110
 Will be 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.360
 Mitaka is an interior tile 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.590
 There are many uses for 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.000
 Let's look at this call and throw division 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:46.250
 Exterior tile This is 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.319
 1 or 2 pieces of porcelain or those in the design room that have excellent frost resistance 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.130
 Is used for exterior tiles 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.340
 Interior tile 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.230
 Interior tiles are 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.810
 In the statistics room 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:07.700
 It is also possible to fall down the texture or porcelain 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:10.390
 However cold climates and external to out next in part to net stoneware 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.730
 Fall things 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.460
 Next is the floor tile 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.300
 Floor tiles 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.760
 Porcelain or design room 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.010
 And to slip resistance 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.500
 Excellent Boo 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:34.620
 The is the principle medium also 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.620
 Mosaic tiles Mosaic tiles use porcelain or in the design room 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:43.319
 For tiles, keep in mind the water absorption classification and its application 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.319
 Please give me
