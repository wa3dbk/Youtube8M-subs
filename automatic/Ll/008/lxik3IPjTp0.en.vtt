screwdriver get right in the middle of

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.160 
screwdriver get right in the middle of
that<00:02:07.020> blue<00:02:07.290> pad

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
that blue pad

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.570 
that blue pad
just<00:02:09.009> twist<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:11.110> by<00:02:11.260> doing<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:12.310> pads

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
just twist and by doing so that pads

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.740 
just twist and by doing so that pads
going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.850> come<00:02:12.970> out<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.150> its<00:02:13.330> socket<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
going to come out of its socket and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.390 
going to come out of its socket and
luckily<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.990> separation<00:02:17.560> pad<00:02:17.740> actually<00:02:18.190> has

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
luckily the separation pad actually has

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.690 
luckily the separation pad actually has
a<00:02:18.430> little<00:02:18.970> spring<00:02:19.420> underneath<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.459> you're

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
a little spring underneath it so you're

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.160 
a little spring underneath it so you're
not<00:02:21.730> going<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> hurt<00:02:22.150> anything<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.720> that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
not much to it they wear the rubber

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.720 
not much to it they wear the rubber
wears<00:02:37.959> becomes<00:02:38.410> flush<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.069> plastic<00:02:39.580> and

wears becomes flush with the plastic and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.250 
wears becomes flush with the plastic and
that's<00:02:40.090> when<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.360> multiple-page<00:02:40.900> pulling

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
that's when the multiple-page pulling

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.900 
that's when the multiple-page pulling
problems<00:02:41.560> start<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.220> when<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.610> reinstall

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
problems start and when you reinstall
