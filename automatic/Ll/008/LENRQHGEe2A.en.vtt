lefties<00:03:39.420> or<00:03:39.510> righties<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:40.050> use<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:41.250> I

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
lefties or righties can use it and I

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.770 
lefties or righties can use it and I
find<00:03:41.640> like<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.240> if<00:03:42.390> I'm<00:03:42.510> scoring

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
find like I think if I'm scoring

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.120 
find like I think if I'm scoring
anything<00:03:43.170> less<00:03:43.350> than<00:03:43.560> luck<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.950> because

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
anything less than luck in it because

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.770 
anything less than luck in it because
the<00:03:44.370> scores<00:03:44.640> are<00:03:44.730> equal<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.090> both<00:03:45.150> sides<00:03:45.540> if

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the scores are equal on both sides if

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.300 
the scores are equal on both sides if
i'm<00:03:45.900> doing<00:03:46.050> an<00:03:46.290> inch<00:03:46.440> score<00:03:46.740> i<00:03:46.770> just<00:03:47.100> score<00:03:47.280> on

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
i'm doing an inch score i just score on

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.900 
i'm doing an inch score i just score on
11<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:48.540> an<00:03:48.630> easier
