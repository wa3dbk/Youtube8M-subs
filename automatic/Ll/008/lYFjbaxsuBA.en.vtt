Honda<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.340> different<00:00:32.699> they

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
Honda is a little different they

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.619 
Honda is a little different they
actually<00:00:33.839> have<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.019> locking<00:00:34.409> nut<00:00:35.420> right<00:00:36.420> over

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
actually have a locking nut right over

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
actually have a locking nut right over
here<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:38.429> locking<00:00:38.850> nut<00:00:39.170> it's<00:00:40.579> 19

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
here and this locking nut it's 19

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.869 
here and this locking nut it's 19
millimeter<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.469> then<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.949> caliper<00:00:44.399> bolt<00:00:44.640> at

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
millimeter and then the caliper bolt at

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.779 
millimeter and then the caliper bolt at
the<00:00:44.940> back<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.679> is<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> 14

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the back here this one is a 14

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.629 
the back here this one is a 14
millimeter<00:00:48.269> right<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.139> so<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.339> were<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
millimeter right here so if you were to

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.139 
millimeter right here so if you were to
put<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> 14<00:00:51.479> millimeter<00:00:51.989> socket<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
put the 14 millimeter socket here and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
put the 14 millimeter socket here and
you<00:00:54.299> try<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> loosen<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.159> what<00:00:56.159> you'll<00:00:56.280> find<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you try to loosen it what you'll find is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.629 
you try to loosen it what you'll find is
that<00:00:56.729> this<00:00:57.569> will<00:00:58.079> keep<00:00:58.589> on<00:00:58.799> turning<00:00:59.069> along

00:00:59.629 --> 00:00:59.639 
that this will keep on turning along

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:01.789 
that this will keep on turning along
with<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> outside<00:01:00.329> bolt<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.499> do<00:01:01.709> this

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
with the outside bolt and you do this

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.520 
with the outside bolt and you do this
all<00:01:01.949> day<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.929> do<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.290> get

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
all day so what you need to do is get

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.749 
all day so what you need to do is get
your<00:01:04.710> 19<00:01:05.280> millimeter<00:01:07.189> put<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
your 19 millimeter put this on the

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.810 
your 19 millimeter put this on the
locking<00:01:08.969> nut<00:01:09.329> back<00:01:10.259> here<00:01:10.700> like<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.649> then

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
locking nut back here like so and then

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.380 
locking nut back here like so and then
for<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.939> 14<00:01:15.270> millimeter<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.869> outside

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
for your 14 millimeter on the outside

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
for your 14 millimeter on the outside
while<00:01:18.390> holding<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.740> 14<00:01:20.130> millimeter<00:01:23.119> get

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
while holding the 14 millimeter get

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.929 
while holding the 14 millimeter get
yourself<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> mallet<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.280> give<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.399> a<00:01:26.460> few<00:01:26.670> tap

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
yourself a mallet and give it a few tap

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
yourself a mallet and give it a few tap
on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.750> locking<00:01:27.960> nut<00:01:28.289> locking<00:01:28.740> nut<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
on the locking nut locking nut so you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.810 
on the locking nut locking nut so you
want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> loosen<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> okay<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.429> loosens

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
want to loosen it okay so this loosens

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.469 
want to loosen it okay so this loosens
up<00:01:36.109> once<00:01:37.109> that's<00:01:37.259> loosen<00:01:37.740> up

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
up once that's loosen up

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:51.350 
up once that's loosen up
then<00:01:40.939> caliper<00:01:41.939> bolt<00:01:43.429> come<00:01:44.429> out

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.910 

and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.080> when<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.320> assemble<00:01:52.590> everything

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
and then when you assemble everything

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
and then when you assemble everything
together<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.970> basically<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> same<00:01:55.050> thing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
together it's basically the same thing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.280 
together it's basically the same thing
you<00:01:55.320> threat<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.400> in<00:01:56.810> after<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.900> threat<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
you threat this in after you threat this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.710 
you threat this in after you threat this
on<00:01:58.440> all<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.650> way<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.330> 19

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
on all the way and then use a 19

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.620 
on all the way and then use a 19
millimeter<00:02:00.900> wrench<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.250> snug<00:02:03.120> it<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.330> tighten

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
millimeter wrench and snug it up tighten

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.560 
millimeter wrench and snug it up tighten
it<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.270> hope<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
it up and then that's it so I hope this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.210 
it up and then that's it so I hope this
