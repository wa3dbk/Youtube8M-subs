00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 that reminds me that I 'm going to say some 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.720
 competition 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.650
 if we talk about the credits because in fact 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.300
 the credits are already in another video like this 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.559
 mean I do not know whether to cut this part that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.790
 it will also be shown to people because 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.470
 we could have as a small space 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.180
 to chat people talking things 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.250
 interesting tell us about your problems 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.880
 it will solve everything highlighted the doctor 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880
 heart 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.720
 I want to talk a little about the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 channel situation because these are the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.540
 final credits then like that in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.190
 reality white like I have a certain 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.550
 empathy with this game because they have been 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.620
 like almost two years that you remember 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 when the year starts and nothing good there is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 than finish it before the end of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 year to have it ready and since for 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 this happened from huelva while 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.780
 and interestingly, it's more like I 'm taking you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.079
 I can believe it is true people of all 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.539
 I really do not miss the words 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.280
 long duck missing it all 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.379
 comments that really put the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.400
 shit while the face always attacked 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.400
 ugly good ugly 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:20.490
 a life that is really like what 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.840
 we say with care do not worry anything 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.090
 but the truth is that most of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.800
 people put comments as well 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 encouraging it was like we were waiting for them 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.310
 It was like it did not matter what they 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.760
 gone as three months four months 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.620
 five days without 60 weeks 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.630
 and to the support and in fact they did not understand the 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.670
 people would think that is how they are now 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.710
 these guys are not guys do not understand 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.630
 revilla what is happening immediately 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 who give us their understanding and everything said 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.800
 also its time we are going to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.010
 wait even after a midday with a 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.010
 bus 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.090
 for this one I went and it was like I was coming 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.100
 remorse really made them 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.630
 I have to say very honestly that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.450
 I never came back in the channel in fact 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.720
 I always came the moment was like that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.790
 I do not owe this to the people I tell them because 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.959
 still outside with all the support of 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.340
 truth that I am in debt to all 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.090
 you because they are more than two thousand 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 people 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 because my life the channel of 50 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 subscribers 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.940
 reasons please 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.540
 many things in the game because in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.400
 reality we are reproduce it on 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.930
 first let's play the bathroom in fact I 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.230
 I will always consider it that way in 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.230
 Spain 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.319
 calculated handled but actually I 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.720
 when I looked for it at the beginning of the year 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.760
 when last year's fruit 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 I must say when I bush there was a 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.120
 banjo toy supplier but in network already 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.940
 does not get more from the second world then 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.470
 I said bitch and wait for the deployment of 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.269
 l patterns that distinguish trick are 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.040
 say we started this when 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.380
 it had ended on youtube 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 I'm fine and I was waiting for 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.440
 I did on YouTube because said 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.849
 promised he had promised and said fruit 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.349
 then after this game goes to 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.660
 do it and I never did it because I know that 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.489
 I was going to be first I have symphony I was 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.720
 other games that I had in mind and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.640
 wait for baths eve to the bathroom 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.260
 really fucking experiences yes I 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.520
 I also know the game because I do not have 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.800
 to wait for another 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.070
 I can also teach myself 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.650
 to these people who work for 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.100
 example there are people who do not understand how 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.320
 people may like it or I 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.060
 I make this world then as if 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.490
 he had that knowledge he had to give 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.830
 how to leave a legacy of the world to the 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.600
 around the planet with the planet I do not know 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.340
 I'm really glad that for example it's going to 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.930
 more than for example of a person not 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.940
 In addition to helping her, she was happy 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.230
 day if the objectives are met 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.180
 only help but also 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.250
 entertain them because that was my goal 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.350
 I was not christine on youtube nor did I 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.940
 do as someone recognized and neither 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.800
 I'm not recognized by the game either 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.640
 just let them have a good time 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.640
 while and that really 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.870
 have some comment and the truth that 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.120
 I have several feelings with 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 this game is very nice 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.380
 I have the world liked very enchanted 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.940
 go back to do this game again said 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.410
 I am not very satisfied with the 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.450
 first videos I find that they are like 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.459
 a very low quality obviously in fact 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.690
 they are not very decent either now at 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.030
 less is better than if we had 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.560
 direct match with this profile 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.480
 and mansion first of which it was like 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.010
 to test ground and then throw ourselves 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.810
 with this thing but I'm glad that you 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.280
 You liked it really feel that 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.320
 truth and I felt I had not been 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.840
 very good but really you are and they 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.220
 liked I do not have a word fulfilled and 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.750
 then it would be here but in reality 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.960
 it's like he does not like operations 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.490
 from 310 team very chaotic but the truth 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.900
 is that we are as well in debt to 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.790
 you do not really know how 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.230
 tell them this but all this is thanks 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.820
 to you and indeed if we are here 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.820
 thanks to you also in three days 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.350
 we left halfway through the channel 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.510
 maybe abandoned a long time ago if 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.520
 we are here is bitch then for his 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.590
 support for their understanding and because they are 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.590
 day by day and supporting us by facebook 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.460
 the majority was wonderful 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.840
 a great greeting deputy 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900
