just because some of them look like they

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.720 
just because some of them look like they
were<00:03:53.650> they're<00:03:54.010> messing<00:03:54.579> up<00:03:54.900> cracks<00:03:55.900> okay<00:03:56.890> tape

I<00:03:58.329> taped<00:03:58.989> this<00:03:59.590> whole<00:03:59.829> section<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.370> wing

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
I taped this whole section of the wing

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.160 
I taped this whole section of the wing
with<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> clear<00:04:02.500> packaging<00:04:03.159> tape<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.930> whole

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
with a clear packaging tape this whole

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.420 
with a clear packaging tape this whole
piece<00:04:05.379> right<00:04:05.470> here<00:04:05.700> on<00:04:06.700> both<00:04:06.970> sides<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.769> I

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
piece right here on both sides and I

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:27.659 
piece right here on both sides and I
think<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.730> ran<00:04:25.470> just<00:04:26.470> keep<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.340> from<00:04:27.460> breaking

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
think I ran just keep it from breaking

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.050 
think I ran just keep it from breaking
off<00:04:28.800> here<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:31.510> then<00:04:31.660> here<00:04:31.870> too<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:33.060> to

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
off here and then here too just to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.120 
off here and then here too just to
reinforce<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.720> little<00:04:34.870> bit<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.530> then<00:04:35.800> tape

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
reinforce it a little bit and then tape

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:51.589 
reinforce it a little bit and then tape
all<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.610> way<00:04:36.789> down<00:04:48.150> here<00:04:49.560> because<00:04:50.560> my<00:04:51.039> plane

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
all the way down here because my plane

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.820 
all the way down here because my plane
was<00:04:52.599> a<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.650> ARF<00:04:54.240> motor<00:04:55.240> servos<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.110> it

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
was a the the ARF motor servos and it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.719 
was a the the ARF motor servos and it
came<00:04:56.949> in<00:04:57.130> two<00:04:57.280> pieces<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:59.470> what<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:00.400> did<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.610> just

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
came in two pieces so what I did I just

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.930 
came in two pieces so what I did I just
had<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.630> glue<00:05:01.930> everything<00:05:02.229> back<00:05:02.500> together<00:05:02.940> so

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
had to glue everything back together so

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.279 
had to glue everything back together so
just<00:05:04.570> hot<00:05:04.720> glue<00:05:04.750> here<00:05:05.729> tape<00:05:06.729> here<00:05:07.080> along<00:05:08.080> this

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
just hot glue here tape here along this

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:16.100 
just hot glue here tape here along this
this<00:05:08.889> part<00:05:09.130> here<00:05:09.280> here<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:12.370> tape<00:05:14.460> like<00:05:15.460> xed<00:05:15.849> it

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
this part here here and tape like xed it

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.140 
this part here here and tape like xed it
all<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.229> way<00:05:17.289> through<00:05:17.500> here<00:05:17.880> with<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:18.970> belly

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
all the way through here with the belly

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.570 
all the way through here with the belly
tape<00:05:19.419> and<00:05:19.659> it's<00:05:20.470> just<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:21.010> keep<00:05:21.159> it<00:05:21.370> from

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
tape and it's just to keep it from

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.790 
tape and it's just to keep it from
cracking<00:05:21.880> off<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:23.199> I<00:05:23.229> haven't<00:05:23.380> had<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.560> problem

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
cracking off so I haven't had a problem

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.730 
cracking off so I haven't had a problem
with<00:05:23.979> it<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.820> can<00:05:24.909> see<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.419> my<00:05:25.900> other

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
with it you can see the the my other

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.439 
with it you can see the the my other
video<00:05:27.039> of<00:05:27.159> it<00:05:27.310> crashing<00:05:28.320> way<00:05:29.320> out<00:05:29.530> there<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:31.180> I

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
video of it crashing way out there and I

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.460 
video of it crashing way out there and I
don't<00:05:31.510> know<00:05:31.659> the<00:05:31.870> heights<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.260> height<00:05:32.440> goes

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
don't know the heights the height goes

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.210 
don't know the heights the height goes
deep<00:05:33.630> actually<00:05:34.630> it<00:05:34.810> was<00:05:34.900> just<00:05:34.930> way<00:05:35.650> up<00:05:35.919> there

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
deep actually it was just way up there

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.689 
deep actually it was just way up there
and<00:05:37.320> all<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.710> happened<00:05:39.039> to<00:05:39.130> it<00:05:39.250> was<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.460> little

plane<00:06:07.030> can<00:06:07.360> hold<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.980> 26<00:06:08.980> only<00:06:09.370> because<00:06:09.550> I've

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
plane can hold it 26 only because I've

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.820 
plane can hold it 26 only because I've
had<00:06:09.790> some<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:11.110> seems<00:06:11.320> to<00:06:11.380> work<00:06:12.120> three<00:06:13.120> so

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
had some and it seems to work three so
