00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:13.740
 the emphasis on service 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:16.289
 We, the film, speak, people, beauty, that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.029
 They say shit b6 on the channel and today I am 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.609
 here along with the epic actively to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.710
 serious attention and talk guys youtube 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.750
 beauty that will bring another channel 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.570
 You're in the company of shit. 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.910
 so it is here in the cermac that in the case 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.059
 is a new server and that afterwards minimums in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.370
 that appears the mct that in the case is the ep already 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.440
 recorded in the case we will vote here on the blog 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.260
 even under a similar system such as 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 severe and in the case are track 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.239
 no one has the brain in export 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.789
 around the echo and what will happen in the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.320
 You are also thinking about it here. 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 you can never be 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.840
 clicking on the cardiff you are seeing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.910
 video of him and in the case and has certain 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 very crazy that the world was uncle scar 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.660
 wars but it 's not just cars cars with 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.190
 one need not look book you are 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.080
 with profusion and felipe with max porto 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.299
 playing well lisa niemi table but none 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.820
 record from the screen but sharing 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.159
 so here it is because these portals 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.810
 giant that will enter it and in the case 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.180
 I'm not trying things that can rain 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 a long time in question is the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.049
 every match and almost was such that the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.630
 lobby everything well created that anyway 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.369
 As the ipc is here there are several things that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.229
 the pair of pcm 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.880
 The only problem for you is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.250
 restart guys because it's normal because 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.780
 it will not lock everything is normal the guys 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 so you may be entering again 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.460
 it is not in the case that it serves that gave the start that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.329
 because there were a lot of people here and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 never so, just like cbdn restarts 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.200
 constantly so only it does not count 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.659
 with your experience and in case you have 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 lord of smash mobile gauchos with the box 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.360
 brings normal 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.189
 and what I live for is that it takes the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.590
 game in the case and said that it is 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.680
 accompanying all the boys who pass 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.000
 cast in the channel in theory and application 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.670
 I think that's it 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.070
 then that hug or sign up 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 the next one was written from your favorites 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.790
 but at the end of the season that enrollment 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.790
 That hug and I said okay, I went
