00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.480
 once i stumbled upon such an interesting 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.899
 phrase regarding sales and cold 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.900
 calls 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.400
 sounded so bad 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.889
 make a sales manager 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 is to take the phone and start calling 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.470
 to strangers sounds enough fuse 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 on however in practice when we start 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.779
 make cold calls we understand that yes 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.380
 really it is not the most pleasant 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.500
 occupation 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.320
 it is often not the most effective and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.390
 today in this video course I would 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.059
 I wanted to talk about how to do 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.219
 correct this ugliness we spent 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 a little marketing 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.719
 research on this topic and found out 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 which questions are most relevant to 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.230
 managers for the head of the department 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.270
 of sales 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 when this problem comes up 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:58.760
 cold calls 1 by importance 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.760
 problems are what managers fear 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.170
 afraid to make cold calls 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 as a rule, these are novice managers. 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 The second problem is that the manager they 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 want to make cold calls i mean they 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 not afraid but do not want and it is usually 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 refers to already experienced managers 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.710
 Well, if you once worked with your hand 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 sales department know what to make 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 expand customer base already experienced 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.200
 managers using cold dialing 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:35.030
 this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:38.119
 still that pleasure do not want the third 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.689
 problem third question when expanding 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.939
 the customer base is actually where 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.939
 take customer base for calling 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.469
 where to take the base the fourth problem is 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.310
 how to get to the person receiving 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:07.119
 decision how to overcome this secretary 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.119
 barrier how to get 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.829
 decision maker and fifth 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.780
 problem 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.400
 what exactly to say it is 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:27.140
 script script 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.400
 cold call in this video course 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.880
 cold bell 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.670
 we just consider all these problems 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.400
 and according to the results of this video course you 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.120
 get ready script cold 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.650
 call for your particular business and 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.690
 so let's take a look 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.489
 where do these problems come from what is their 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.799
 the reason is because when she will understand in 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.440
 than their reason we will understand that with 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.109
 they do and so problem number one 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.690
 beginners are afraid to do a cold zone 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.450
 why are they afraid 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.840
 very simple they are just not sure what 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.840
 they are not sure 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.780
 not sure 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.420
 first but first of all they are not 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.470
 confident not well how am i a manager 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.360
 by sales 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.490
 and there on that end of the tube sit there 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.530
 CEO therefore arises 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.750
 such a question who I am and who he appears 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.610
 such uncertainty and appropriate 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.110
 intonation is such an attempt to adjust the bottom 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.960
 understand what i'm talking about 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.450
 it works effectively but see how 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.410
 your conversion how much 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.200
 calls 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.240
 built here by this tactic attempt 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.600
 tune out the bottom so here I am 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.980
 little you are so great 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.250
 can sometimes be really working 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.680
 unsure of themselves the second thing they are not 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.510
 sure they are not sure about themselves 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.770
 companies in your business in which they 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:07.070
 work but correctly imagine 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.640
 they came 2-3 days a week on 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.250
 backwards 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.340
 and what exactly do they know about the company 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.260
 and usually their positions you know i'm here 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.010
 I've been working recently 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.240
 I still do not know anything so well with this 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.930
 internal sensations of course they are 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.050
 imagine how they can 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.180
 position your company if they 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.760
 they know nothing when you them 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.110
 hired, I don't think that you 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.240
 very much long and detailed 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.610
 told the story of the company and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.200
 correct and 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.430
 position and even if they did it 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.570
 right then anyway in order to 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.550
 man learned correctly 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.810
 position the company it into it 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.730
 it takes a long time to train the third 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.180
 moment than they are not sure they are not sure 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.180
 in the product 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.270
 right they don't use like they 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.900
 can be sure of it that is they 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.410
 came day 23 week ago by product 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.240
 they do not use and moreover they 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.250
 actually can say about it 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.080
 product 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.660
 so they are not sure it is such a 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.330
 idea what it means to know the product gives 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.039
 very important point to know the product who 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.199
 such a good seller is a good seller 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.419
 who knows the product product knowledge 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.729
 suggests the seller 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:36.169
 this is a professional use 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.090
 This product is not because of its 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.340
 assemble make make and by 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.900
 using this product but 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.169
 imagine here you came for example 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.800
 buy TV and you seller in 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.190
 the store 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.360
 instead of instead 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.199
 tell how to use it 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.910
 TV will tell you how to make it 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.490
 Well, yes, he is certainly a professional in this 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.220
 very well versed new then needed 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.810
 other knowledge you need human knowledge 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.449
 which is professional 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.070
 can use this product as 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.510
 rule newbies yes even not only 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.760
 novice and experienced managers 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.500
 are not professionals by 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.530
 use of the product but they themselves 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.240
 it is not used so let's summarize 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:23.580
 in order to remove the fear of newbies 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.449
 here is this fear to call do 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.690
 cold calls 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.150
 you must tell them clearly and even better 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.409
 write it is absolutely necessary to write 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.210
 yes how should they position themselves 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.110
 with a cold call as they should 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.570
 to position 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.169
 to represent the company in Russian and how 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.740
 they must represent the product that is 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:48.479
 all this taken together 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.349
 should turn into concrete 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.979
 written cold call script then 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.979
 there is a need script 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:02.030
 how to present yourself how to represent 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.820
 company how to represent the product and 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:09.030
 only after that when the script 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.460
 write it out and track it 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.060
 so that the cold call is carried out by 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.060
 the script
