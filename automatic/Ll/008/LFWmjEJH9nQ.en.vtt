Java which was released on april third
through<00:00:50.670> Apple<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.360> should<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.660> okay<00:00:52.309> however

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
through Apple you should be okay however

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.310 
through Apple you should be okay however
if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.730> still<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> old<00:00:54.570> version<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
if you still have the old version or you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.540 
if you still have the old version or you
were<00:00:55.379> infected<00:00:55.530> before<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.399> obviously

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
were infected before then obviously

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.229 
were infected before then obviously
that's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.770> problem<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.640> consider<00:01:00.030> those

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that's a problem and so consider those

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
that's a problem and so consider those
possibilities<00:01:02.570> once<00:01:03.570> flashback<00:01:04.470> has

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
possibilities once flashback has

bad<00:01:17.070> applet<00:01:17.490> pops<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.840> begins

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
bad applet pops up and then it begins

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
bad applet pops up and then it begins
installing<00:01:19.380> components<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> computer

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
installing components on a computer

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.260 
installing components on a computer
things<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
things that you don't want so so you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.039 
things that you don't want so so you
should<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:26.090> but<00:01:27.090> again<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> looks

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
should see that but again it it looks

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
should see that but again it it looks
like<00:01:28.140> japa<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.460> may<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.390> but

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
like japa so you may not really know but

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.969 
like japa so you may not really know but
either<00:01:30.930> way<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.439> doesn't<00:01:31.470> need<00:01:31.860> your

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
either way it doesn't need your

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.020 
either way it doesn't need your
permission<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.579> begins<00:01:32.820> installing

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
permission it just begins installing

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
permission it just begins installing
yourself<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.350> once<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.770> inserted<00:01:35.250> itself

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
yourself so once it's inserted itself

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.420 
yourself so once it's inserted itself
into<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.299> computer<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:37.829> inserts

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
into your computer it then inserts

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.319 
into your computer it then inserts
itself<00:01:38.970> into<00:01:39.119> your<00:01:39.720> web<00:01:39.900> browser<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.329> begins

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
to check both of those so I'm just going

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.210 
to check both of those so I'm just going
to<00:03:42.220> go<00:03:42.370> back<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.720> those<00:03:43.959> actually<00:03:44.920> before

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
to go back to to those actually before

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.580 
to go back to to those actually before
that<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:46.360> can<00:03:46.480> just<00:03:46.660> look<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:46.900> their<00:03:47.110> example

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
that we can just look at their example

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.410 
that we can just look at their example
right<00:03:47.770> here<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.310> window<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.150> will

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
right here this is the window that will

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.140 
right here this is the window that will
pop<00:03:49.600> up<00:03:49.630> once<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.230> run<00:03:50.410> these<00:03:50.590> scripts<00:03:51.150> a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
pop up once you run these scripts a

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.730 
pop up once you run these scripts a
little<00:03:52.600> bit<00:03:52.720> different<00:03:52.990> for<00:03:53.140> both<00:03:53.320> but<00:03:53.620> the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
little bit different for both but the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.190 
little bit different for both but the
ending<00:03:54.010> should<00:03:54.250> be<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.520> same<00:03:54.760> does<00:03:55.570> not<00:03:55.780> exist

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
ending should be the same does not exist

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.050 
ending should be the same does not exist
is<00:03:56.440> what<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.680> want<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:56.920> look<00:03:57.040> for<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.550> if

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
is what you want to look for and if

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.240 
is what you want to look for and if
that's<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.420> case<00:03:58.630> then<00:03:59.070> you're<00:04:00.070> in<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.160> clear

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
that's the case then you're in the clear

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.320 
that's the case then you're in the clear

great<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.760> cause<00:05:16.000> for<00:05:16.030> emergency<00:05:16.750> but<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.080> is

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
great a cause for emergency but it is

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.510 
great a cause for emergency but it is
something<00:05:17.320> you'll<00:05:17.590> want<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.800> check<00:05:17.980> for<00:05:18.040> see

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
something you'll want to check for see

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.820 
something you'll want to check for see
if<00:05:18.610> you<00:05:18.730> have<00:05:18.880> this<00:05:19.120> flashback<00:05:19.900> virus<00:05:20.560> and

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
if you have this flashback virus and

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.830 
if you have this flashback virus and
this<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.760> everything<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.120> need<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.750> get

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
this is everything you need to to get

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.060 
this is everything you need to to get
rid<00:05:22.990> of<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.140> really<00:05:23.430> so<00:05:25.650> again<00:05:26.650> I'll<00:05:26.800> provide

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
rid of it really so again I'll provide

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.650 
rid of it really so again I'll provide
links<00:05:27.430> for<00:05:27.670> those<00:05:27.850> pages<00:05:28.150> that<00:05:28.420> I<00:05:28.450> went

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
links for those pages that I went

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.760 
links for those pages that I went
through<00:05:29.460> but<00:05:30.460> basically<00:05:31.240> if<00:05:31.570> you<00:05:31.840> want<00:05:32.710> to

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
through but basically if you want to

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.900 
through but basically if you want to
make<00:05:32.890> sure<00:05:32.920> you're<00:05:33.160> protected<00:05:33.310> for<00:05:33.790> right<00:05:33.880> now

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
make sure you're protected for right now

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.910 
make sure you're protected for right now
probably<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.420> quickest<00:05:34.840> fix<00:05:35.230> is<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.500> go<00:05:35.890> to

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920

to get in and beyond that you'll want to

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.930 
to get in and beyond that you'll want to
make<00:05:56.740> sure<00:05:56.860> that<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:57.190> have<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.340> most<00:05:57.580> updated

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
versions of Java so I'm not sure that it

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.790 
versions of Java so I'm not sure that it
will<00:06:02.740> work<00:06:02.800> on<00:06:03.100> every<00:06:04.000> browser<00:06:04.240> but<00:06:04.930> if<00:06:05.590> you

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800

working antivirus software's they should
catch<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:18.070> as<00:06:18.250> well<00:06:19.500> so<00:06:20.500> anyway<00:06:20.890> that's<00:06:21.010> just
