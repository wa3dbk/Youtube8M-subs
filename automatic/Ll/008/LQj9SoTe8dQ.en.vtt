00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.700
 I introduce myself 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 the acquired arbor the builder of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.429
 two dinaly helicopters so this l 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.170
 helicopter ulm dinaly so classis 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:24.650
 it's the prototype it will be approved 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.439
 in the coming weeks he 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.439
 he weighs 2 185 kg to get into the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.390
 ulm category 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.850
 it is equipped with the simplest engine 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 of dear tax roughly 7 912 that's 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.030
 which makes 100 horses 100 horses 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.450
 it's more than enough have to 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 team and of course rotax 914 but these 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 six kilos more and the category lm 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.780
 we impose 185 kg so we will 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.239
 exceed if we put 1,914 or so will 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.320
 find still had to lighten this elsewhere 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.020
 which is not impossible 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.439
 we will see in time it can fly 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.330
 with or without fairing 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.479
 it is extremely pleasant to fly 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 without fairing to have your head in the wind 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.689
 the drivers of the lm know this 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.390
 sensation 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.409
 the performances this helicopter flies to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.420
 135 km to equipped with this basic engine and 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 aluminum blades we are trying 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.750
 to study composite blades for 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.460
 make it fly faster with full 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 of gasoline 50 liters it can carry 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.979
 two people totaling 180 kg 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.299
 autorotation are very simple the beach 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 of diet 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.670
 between 381 turn and 580 turn the scheme 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.399
 nominal is 520 round 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.479
 and then the auto rotation is extremely 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.710
 simple what can be said about this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.520
 helicopter is that it is extremely 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.990
 simple to fly 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.819
 it's so easy to fly 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.399
 wanted to call him easyflyer 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.860
 as it is written on 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.049
 he's in the name at the stationary 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.299
 at takeoff he's in the name of going out a 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.130
 helicopter also stable one can 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.770
 practically dropped the orders in 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.700
 stationary and then he is very stable 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.060
 in the wind the tail rotor equal with 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 his four little steps there that turns fast 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.630
 is insensitive to lateral wind autonomy 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.239
 with 50 liters at 10.7 liters per hour 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.049
 so we have almost three hours to 135 km 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:33.150
 hour it costs 119 1000 euros ttc he 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.290
 can be mounted directly from the sinn for 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.359
 6000 euros more 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.069
 it's a kit initially missed both 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:41.840
 possibilities the folder is completely 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.410
 constituted and we're going to input them 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.170
 current of the month there if the record well 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.389
 makes that helicopter and gets back into the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.359
 frame in the weight of the eu she likes the 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.760
 folder is usually very quickly 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.299
 processed so we can hope that end 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.340
 October 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.400
 this helicopter will be registered in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.400
 la France
