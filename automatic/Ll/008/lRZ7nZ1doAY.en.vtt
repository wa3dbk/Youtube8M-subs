00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.870 

now<00:01:42.960> why<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.260> we<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.680> indicate<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> score<00:01:44.700> as

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
now why do we not indicate the score as

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.760 
now why do we not indicate the score as
it<00:01:45.060> should<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.390> played<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:45.960> may<00:01:46.140> ask<00:01:46.350> well

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it should be played you may ask well

it should be played you may ask well
quite<00:01:47.070> simply<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.760> music<00:01:48.120> would<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.420> ever

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
quite simply the music would look ever

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.780 
quite simply the music would look ever
so<00:01:49.140> complicated<00:01:49.830> with<00:01:50.010> all<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.400> triplet

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
so complicated with all the triplet

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.660 
so complicated with all the triplet
markings<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.350> jazz<00:01:52.590> world<00:01:52.620> this<00:01:53.340> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
markings and in the jazz world this just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
markings and in the jazz world this just
isn't<00:01:53.850> considered<00:01:54.420> necessary<00:01:55.400> but<00:01:56.400> there's<00:01:56.550> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
isn't considered necessary but there's a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.640 
isn't considered necessary but there's a
little<00:01:56.940> more<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.330> swing<00:01:57.660> than<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.410> this

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
little more to swing than just this

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.640 
little more to swing than just this
there's<00:01:59.400> also<00:01:59.580> an<00:02:00.060> underlying<00:02:00.780> feeling<00:02:01.470> of

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
there's also an underlying feeling of

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.130 
there's also an underlying feeling of
syncopation<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.880> an<00:02:03.000> appropriate<00:02:03.690> swing

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
syncopation and an appropriate swing

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
syncopation and an appropriate swing
phrasing<00:02:04.980> it's<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.640> feeling<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.150> fact<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
phrasing it's a feeling in fact that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350 
phrasing it's a feeling in fact that
often<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.740> quite<00:02:08.100> alien<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.910> classical

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
often is quite alien to classical

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.290 
often is quite alien to classical
pianist<00:02:09.750> let<00:02:10.679> me<00:02:10.800> give<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.220> an<00:02:11.430> example<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
pianist let me give you an example a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.330 
pianist let me give you an example a
classical<00:02:12.840> pianist<00:02:13.050> might<00:02:13.440> approach<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
classical pianist might approach the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:27.880 
classical pianist might approach the
beginning<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> song<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.630> this

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.650 

whereas<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> jazz<00:02:29.250> pianist<00:02:29.820> would<00:02:30.360> probably

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
whereas a jazz pianist would probably

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.480 
whereas a jazz pianist would probably
look<00:02:30.810> at<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.020> same<00:02:31.260> music<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.860> play<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.220> like

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
look at the same music and play it like

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:44.420 
look at the same music and play it like
this<00:02:42.320> now<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.380> difference<00:02:43.830> may<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.070> subtle

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
this now the difference may be subtle

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.010 
this now the difference may be subtle
but<00:02:44.850> hopefully<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.540> hear<00:02:45.750> there's<00:02:45.960> a

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
but hopefully you can hear there's a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.250 
but hopefully you can hear there's a
kind<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.350> looser<00:02:46.830> feeling<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> plane

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
kind of looser feeling to the plane

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.840 
kind of looser feeling to the plane
there's<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.710> trick<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.460> playing

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
there's also a little trick to playing

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.530 
there's also a little trick to playing
swing<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.450> many<00:02:51.810> classical<00:02:52.380> pianist<00:02:52.590> miss

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
swing that many classical pianist miss

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.180 
swing that many classical pianist miss
it's<00:02:54.540> typical<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.260> traditional<00:02:55.620> music<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it's typical and traditional music to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.490 
it's typical and traditional music to
emphasize<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.970> first<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> third<00:02:57.930> beats

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
emphasize the first and the third beats

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.340 
emphasize the first and the third beats
of<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.100> bar<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.420> play<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.080> left

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
of the bar so if I play just the left

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:12.710 
of the bar so if I play just the left
hand<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.950> would<00:03:02.160> be<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:11.270> but<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.330> jazz

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
hand it would be like this but a jazz

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.020 
hand it would be like this but a jazz
pianist<00:03:13.320> than<00:03:13.500> jazz<00:03:13.860> feel<00:03:14.310> would<00:03:14.640> tend<00:03:14.940> to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
pianist than jazz feel would tend to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.630 
pianist than jazz feel would tend to
emphasize<00:03:15.440> more<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.620> second<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> fourth

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
emphasize more the second and the fourth

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.760 
emphasize more the second and the fourth
beats

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.280 

now<00:03:27.460> I'm<00:03:27.760> over<00:03:27.970> playing<00:03:28.420> this<00:03:28.600> example<00:03:29.050> of

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
now I'm over playing this example of

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.020 
now I'm over playing this example of
course<00:03:29.320> but<00:03:29.770> you<00:03:29.890> hopefully<00:03:30.370> can<00:03:30.520> hear<00:03:30.850> what<00:03:31.000> I

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
course but you hopefully can hear what I

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.720 
course but you hopefully can hear what I
mean<00:03:31.440> there's<00:03:32.440> always<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:32.920> feeling<00:03:32.980> of

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
mean there's always this feeling of

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.240 
mean there's always this feeling of
emphasis<00:03:34.480> on<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> second<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.040> fourth

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
emphasis on the second and the fourth

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.550 
emphasis on the second and the fourth
beat<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.910> might<00:03:37.150> not<00:03:37.300> even<00:03:37.330> be<00:03:37.720> audible<00:03:38.320> but

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
beat it might not even be audible but

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.640 
beat it might not even be audible but
there's<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.800> feeling<00:03:39.070> there<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.140> now<00:03:41.320> we<00:03:41.380> can

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
there's a feeling there so now we can

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.890 
there's a feeling there so now we can
see<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.280> hear<00:03:42.310> why<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:42.970> left<00:03:43.330> hand<00:03:43.570> chords

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
see and hear why the left hand chords

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.960 
see and hear why the left hand chords
provide<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.620> rhythmic<00:03:45.010> foundation<00:03:45.700> for<00:03:45.880> this

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
provide the rhythmic foundation for this

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.820 
provide the rhythmic foundation for this
piece<00:03:46.270> they<00:03:46.480> are<00:03:46.510> very<00:03:46.930> important

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
piece they are very important

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.550 
piece they are very important
this<00:03:48.430> relentless<00:03:48.880> stomp<00:03:49.600> feel<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.320> very

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
this relentless stomp feel is very

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.430 
this relentless stomp feel is very
important<00:03:51.100> indeed<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.880> be<00:03:52.180> careful<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:52.930> keep

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
important indeed and be careful to keep

important indeed and be careful to keep
both<00:03:53.680> hands<00:03:54.040> balanced<00:03:54.580> make<00:03:54.820> sure<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.210> left

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
both hands balanced make sure the left

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.740 
both hands balanced make sure the left
hand<00:03:55.630> doesn't<00:03:55.930> overpower<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:57.010> right<00:03:57.220> hand

indeed<00:03:58.750> try<00:03:59.290> practicing<00:03:59.950> hands<00:04:00.400> separately

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
indeed try practicing hands separately

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.350 
indeed try practicing hands separately
always<00:04:01.480> important<00:04:02.020> to<00:04:02.050> do<00:04:02.260> so<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.700> may<00:04:04.000> be<00:04:04.060> that

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
always important to do so it may be that

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.020

your<00:04:04.600> digital<00:04:04.810> piano<00:04:05.470> has<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.550> ability<00:04:06.970> to

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
your digital piano has the ability to

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.380 
your digital piano has the ability to
record<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:08.050> left<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.530> right<00:04:09.070> hand<00:04:09.460> if<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.150> why

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
record a left and right hand if so why

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.300 
record a left and right hand if so why
not<00:04:10.540> try<00:04:10.840> using<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.350> for<00:04:11.680> practising<00:04:12.190> your

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
not try using that for practising your

not try using that for practising your
hand<00:04:12.580> separately<00:04:13.200> record<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.320> left<00:04:14.530> hand

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
hand separately record the left hand

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:31.880 
hand separately record the left hand
first

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.320 

and<00:04:34.080> now<00:04:35.080> try<00:04:35.440> adding<00:04:36.010> your<00:04:36.190> right<00:04:36.460> hand<00:04:36.850> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
and now try adding your right hand to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:55.840 
and now try adding your right hand to
the<00:04:37.360> left<00:04:37.480> hand<00:04:37.840> you've<00:04:38.110> already<00:04:38.290> recorded

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.730 

this<00:04:56.850> can<00:04:57.060> make<00:04:57.210> practicing<00:04:57.840> separate<00:04:58.380> hands

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
this can make practicing separate hands

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.870 
this can make practicing separate hands
far<00:04:59.310> more<00:04:59.490> fun<00:04:59.819> and<00:05:00.060> appealing<00:05:01.490> now<00:05:02.490> as<00:05:02.669> always

for example bar 3 I've changed the

to put in the accents to the notes so by

natural as a jazz pianist if you prefer
to<00:05:30.000> use<00:05:30.330> peddling<00:05:30.990> I'd<00:05:31.169> recommend<00:05:31.770> using<00:05:32.009> as

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
to use peddling I'd recommend using as

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.610 
to use peddling I'd recommend using as
little<00:05:32.610> as<00:05:32.699> possible<00:05:32.910> here<00:05:33.419> be<00:05:33.750> very<00:05:34.139> discreet

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
little as possible here be very discreet

little as possible here be very discreet
about<00:05:34.650> it<00:05:35.030> be<00:05:36.030> careful<00:05:36.419> also<00:05:36.539> not<00:05:37.020> to<00:05:37.320> blur<00:05:37.590> the

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
about it be careful also not to blur the

about it be careful also not to blur the

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
for example bar 5 &amp; 6 you can see the

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.779 
for example bar 5 &amp; 6 you can see the
melody<00:05:42.960> outlines<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.830> harmony<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:44.669> the

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
melody outlines to harmony so the

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.570 
melody outlines to harmony so the
peddling<00:05:45.270> can<00:05:45.750> reinforce<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.440> melody<00:05:46.949> rather

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
peddling can reinforce the melody rather

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:56.360 
peddling can reinforce the melody rather
than<00:05:47.880> blur<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:53.840> if<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:55.650> listen<00:05:55.889> to<00:05:56.280> the

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
than blur it if you listen to the

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.430 
than blur it if you listen to the
recording<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:56.909> will<00:05:57.090> hear<00:05:57.570> it's<00:05:57.810> played<00:05:58.169> with

a fairly upbeat tempo it's approximately

a fairly upbeat tempo it's approximately
120<00:06:02.909> beats<00:06:03.360> per<00:06:03.539> minute<00:06:03.930> but<00:06:04.470> I'd<00:06:04.590> suggest<00:06:04.889> of

120 beats per minute but I'd suggest of

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.339 
120 beats per minute but I'd suggest of

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349
