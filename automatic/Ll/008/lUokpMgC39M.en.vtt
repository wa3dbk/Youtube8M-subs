is called blood on the sand so I'm

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.619 
is called blood on the sand so I'm
guessing<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.339> one<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.089> two<00:05:50.210> things<00:05:50.389> is<00:05:50.539> gonna

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629 
guessing that one of two things is gonna

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.050 
guessing that one of two things is gonna
happen<00:05:50.750> one<00:05:51.710> someone's<00:05:52.520> gonna<00:05:52.610> die<00:05:52.849> in<00:05:52.909> the

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
happen one someone's gonna die in the

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.619 
happen one someone's gonna die in the
next<00:05:53.270> issue

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
next issue

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:56.829 
next issue
my<00:05:54.289> guess<00:05:54.620> if<00:05:54.889> I<00:05:55.310> had<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.639> say<00:05:55.819> and<00:05:56.120> don't<00:05:56.719> get

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:56.839 
my guess if I had to say and don't get

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.990 
my guess if I had to say and don't get
mad<00:05:57.080> when<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.349> say<00:05:57.379> this<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:57.919> feel<00:05:58.370> like<00:05:58.399> scarlet

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
mad when I say this I feel like scarlet

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.360 
mad when I say this I feel like scarlet
might<00:05:59.330> die<00:05:59.599> in<00:05:59.960> the<00:06:00.050> next<00:06:00.169> issue<00:06:00.439> or<00:06:00.860> because

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
might die in the next issue or because

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.070 
might die in the next issue or because
they're<00:06:01.610> on<00:06:01.729> the<00:06:01.849> beach<00:06:02.000> and<00:06:02.300> their<00:06:02.419> sand<00:06:02.750> and

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
they're on the beach and their sand and

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.629 
they're on the beach and their sand and
there's<00:06:03.229> a<00:06:03.289> lot<00:06:03.409> of<00:06:03.529> blood<00:06:03.770> going<00:06:04.039> on<00:06:04.310> here

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
there's a lot of blood going on here

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.980 
there's a lot of blood going on here
maybe<00:06:05.089> that's<00:06:05.360> what<00:06:05.539> they're<00:06:05.599> trying<00:06:05.810> to<00:06:05.839> talk

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
maybe that's what they're trying to talk

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.389 
maybe that's what they're trying to talk
about<00:06:06.139> but<00:06:06.409> I<00:06:06.469> feel<00:06:06.710> like<00:06:06.889> a<00:06:06.949> character<00:06:07.310> is

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:07.399 
about but I feel like a character is

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.040 
about but I feel like a character is
gonna<00:06:07.490> die<00:06:07.729> very<00:06:08.000> soon<00:06:08.389> they<00:06:08.719> said<00:06:08.930> they're

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
gonna die very soon they said they're

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.839 
gonna die very soon they said they're
gonna<00:06:09.169> kill<00:06:09.409> off<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.589> character<00:06:09.710> I'm<00:06:10.399> still
