00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 My name is Nakano today 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.320
 This is a policy that uses cloud alpaca . 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.320
 I will be responsible for the direction of background 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:36.190
 I would like to call a line drawing of illustration to a two-ga shop bus 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:40.149
 First select Open from cloud from toolbar file 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 When you do, the screen for selecting a cloud file will appear. 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:50.110
 Click the line drawing and select ok 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 The line drawing of the illustration is read and rolled like a bus with this 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:03.180
 This time the main is a more of a cherry tree and a woman 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:06.300
 I generally think whether let's a little Japanese-style spring-ish image 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 In the case of rough is Gawatashi is 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.630
 I think I will write with a pencil of brush tool 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:37.050
 I think that I want to do the process of line drawing next 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 I think that I want to write the layer osp seems to lower the transparency 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.350
 扇 え え yeah yeah 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.950
 I would like to support with this pen tool of brush tool 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.250
 Is 2000 a good thickness? 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:59.110
 I'm doing has become the pixel now has too much 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:02.360
 If it's too thick, the background will stand out more than the main character, so it's a slightly thinner line 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:08.290
 I think that I want back in 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.290
 I will put out the petals of the prefecture cherry blossoms to the position I did not write earlier . 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.420
 Not this is the end of the petal line drawing 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:28.320
 Next we will create an object for the background 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:34.080
 Here, I think want to make the image on the Japanese-style rewards by using a nap function 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:39.409
 Using sand and functions, you can easily write concentration lines and clean support etc. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:46.650
 Sounding snap of the Well of that Sur Bar Bar is ne 2 lever 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:51.980
 You can make a standing room from this icon with this egg 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:56.629
 Here we call this central line from the snap of the toolbar 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 Then I could make a ruler with a red line like this 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:06.260
 In the I guess here Ekon when moving the ruler 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:13.040
 You can move the center this way by pressing this black dot 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:16.520
 I want to draw a line around this girl's head this time, so once more here 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:22.460
 Take care to make the click has been fixed 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:24.920
 If you need a line that you want to wear along the nature of this snap, the middle 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.350
 Is a graphical tool 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.790
 this 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:36.360
 In the Fill in Shapes tool 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:42.930
 Fill the center with this ellipse 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:46.560
 And as you say the screening of the church around you say the former part is erased with an eraser and adjusted 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:52.290
 I think that I want to draw a line appropriately 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.480
 I want to go off once snap 8 times so when you turn off this egg 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.350
 Please press the off 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.350

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:05.520
 Will be able to play 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:11.640
 I will use the tool to divide the inside of the current and not split with gold and again fill 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:17.090
 It will be fine as it is right now because it will adjust the way well where the spilled out 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.090
 Road line of person vehicle was completed by this 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:32.340
 Next I think that I want to make it using the snap function because it is splash leakage contamination 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.639
 I will write using the snap function in the same way as Matsu Matsuya Yumi . 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.490
 This time in the function of 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:45.280
 I will use this 10 o'clock snap 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:51.699
 When you make a snap of this cross, the greet will be displayed on the screen like this 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:58.229
 Along the here and draw a line and you can draw to cut a vertical line and a line parallel 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:58.229

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:10.240
 In the case of this checkered pattern that can be cleanly write in this square 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:17.259
 I want to live in a bucket and practice 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:21.639
 And we think that we want to work in active part while selecting with overflowing part with selection tool 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:25.740
 Select the selected part from this layer and clear it 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:29.430
 It can be able to turn off the not selected fan 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.820
 Te owner the last selected range 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.820
 A beautiful checkered pattern is completed with a cat
