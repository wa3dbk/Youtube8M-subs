00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.390
 beautiful fashion resonate welcome to this 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.210
 new spot light 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.640
 today we talk about a mod that adds to 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.500
 new biomes in minecraft these children 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.619
 they are made really very well and there 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.410
 they are of different types ice and bol 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.320
 we have for example the imaginative one that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.690
 I'm using it right now and it is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.710
 really amazing because in addition to 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.170
 being there we are a stone a block that 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.350
 we usually find nether or souls 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.600
 end and the snow braque to above more 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 we also find the monsters we find in the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.750
 that is, the magma cube is also the pd the pd 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.700
 the small spot is yes but this is not 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 all because we will find put blocks 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.309
 the fucking giant trees and so on is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 only in that imaginative while then 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.620
 we have the better bayonne we are going to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.440
 strike islands for five lakes 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.779
 then we find the mountains the mountains 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.359
 giant the alps that we all say things 

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:11.219
 that exist in reality and then we find 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.759
 this fantastic says things that don't 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.829
 they exist in reality and if found 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.579
 we say all the information for how much 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:24.359
 all idioms apply to all biomes 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:26.340
 yes in the post description mi 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.560
 I recommend you download it because 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.069
 I think it's really done really well 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.039
 and now seen already showing a little that 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.020
 imaginative but not all of them are made 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.359
 as I said before but I am from 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.569
 different type 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.109
 here however noted that there are 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.319
 lots of animals 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.899
 here are lots of mobs and then another 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.200
 what really was n't done much 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.719
 well 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.069
 obvious that it happened here this is a 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.709
 canyon there is a canyon I did more or less 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:02.130
 however different it was that I was saying 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.429
 yes here is the log logically here it is ad 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.709
 example you will find trees of this type 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.840
 with this logic in a thing in practice 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.299
 you will also notice a change as far as 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.550
 it's about time 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.580
 what do you mean 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.880
 that is the time suddenly while for 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.100
 example now that is morning more or less 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.640
 suddenly the weather will change fields 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.660
 was yes with the rhodium bee will change and from there 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.520
 will go to the finelli and the night will come and from 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.400
 night suddenly becomes day 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.320
 without going through routines without it 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.370
 a country from evening to morning 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.670
 without the night without sleep and so 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.900
 Street 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.530
 so fields was I created a new one 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.110
 new parolo a new word or but that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.280
