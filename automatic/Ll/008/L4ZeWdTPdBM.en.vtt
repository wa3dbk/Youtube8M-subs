in<00:02:22.469> power<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.349> power<00:02:25.560> on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
in power in and that is your power on

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.910 
in power in and that is your power on
and<00:02:26.189> off<00:02:27.260> right<00:02:28.260> what<00:02:28.409> I'm<00:02:28.470> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.769> now

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and off right what I'm going to do now

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.750 
and off right what I'm going to do now
is<00:02:29.189> try<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:29.849> give<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.030> some<00:02:30.150> sort<00:02:31.109> of<00:02:31.439> a<00:02:32.340> test

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
is try and give you some sort of a test

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.559 
is try and give you some sort of a test
so<00:02:33.390> I've<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.829> track<00:02:35.069> playing<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.909> called

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
so I've got a track playing it's called

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.949 
so I've got a track playing it's called
strut<00:02:36.959> your<00:02:37.109> funky<00:02:37.530> stuff<00:02:37.889> so<00:02:38.400> we'll<00:02:38.969> turn<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
strut your funky stuff so we'll turn the

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:52.759 
strut your funky stuff so we'll turn the
sub<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.299> sub<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.169> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.379> moment

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
sub up that's just sub and at the moment

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.740 
sub up that's just sub and at the moment
now<00:02:52.889> I've<00:02:53.069> only<00:02:53.340> got<00:02:53.609> one<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.209> satellites

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
now I've only got one of the satellites

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:13.890 
now I've only got one of the satellites
plugged<00:02:55.019> in

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.059 

actually<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.140> size<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.709> was<00:03:15.800> quite

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
actually to the size that I was quite

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.820 
actually to the size that I was quite
like<00:03:16.280> all<00:03:16.730> right<00:03:16.879> top<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.140> base<00:03:18.349> speaker

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
like all right top of the base speaker

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.490 
like all right top of the base speaker
you've<00:03:19.640> got<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.209> small<00:03:20.510> insert<00:03:20.959> there<00:03:21.230> now<00:03:21.410> if

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
you've got a small insert there now if

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.390 
you've got a small insert there now if
you<00:03:21.620> want<00:03:21.890> to<00:03:22.099> it<00:03:22.760> doesn't<00:03:23.209> come<00:03:23.629> with<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:25.160> PA

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
you want to it doesn't come with the PA

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.660 
you want to it doesn't come with the PA
but<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.209> can<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.690> extra<00:03:27.430> something<00:03:28.430> called

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
but you can have extra something called

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.729 
but you can have extra something called
a<00:03:28.819> cow<00:03:29.090> horn<00:03:29.450> done<00:03:30.019> if<00:03:30.140> you're<00:03:30.260> familiar<00:03:30.470> with

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
a cow horn done if you're familiar with

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.229 
a cow horn done if you're familiar with
it<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.040> if<00:03:31.099> you<00:03:31.220> imagine<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.640> piece<00:03:31.819> of<00:03:31.940> metal

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
it but if you imagine a piece of metal

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.360 
it but if you imagine a piece of metal
it<00:03:32.330> lifts<00:03:32.599> up<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.260> goes<00:03:33.500> across<00:03:33.860> and<00:03:34.160> then

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
it lifts up it goes across and then

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.070 
it lifts up it goes across and then
you've<00:03:34.459> got<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.790> bit<00:03:35.030> at<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.420> top<00:03:35.630> there<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
you've got a bit at the top there and

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.039 
you've got a bit at the top there and
there<00:03:36.349> so<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.650> can<00:03:36.830> almost<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:37.910> fit<00:03:38.239> both

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
there so you can almost you can fit both

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.680 
there so you can almost you can fit both
of<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.500> speaker's<00:03:39.980> on<00:03:40.130> so<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.299> want<00:03:41.330> to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
of the speaker's on so if you want to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.259 
of the speaker's on so if you want to
you<00:03:42.080> could<00:03:42.230> have<00:03:42.440> two<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.220> these<00:03:43.370> setups<00:03:43.760> and

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
you could have two of these setups and

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.800 
you could have two of these setups and
even<00:03:44.989> run<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:45.680> example<00:03:46.489> one<00:03:47.120> set<00:03:47.390> up<00:03:47.569> for<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
even run for example one set up for the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.220 
even run for example one set up for the
right<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.380> one<00:03:48.709> set<00:03:48.980> up<00:03:49.130> for<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.340> left<00:03:50.230> so

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
right and one set up for the left so

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.809 
right and one set up for the left so
let's<00:03:51.410> imagine<00:03:51.530> you've<00:03:51.980> got<00:03:52.010> two<00:03:52.400> sets<00:03:52.670> of

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
let's imagine you've got two sets of

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.539 
let's imagine you've got two sets of
compact<00:03:53.329> 12<00:03:53.630> Pro<00:03:53.930> what<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.739> do<00:03:54.920> is<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.280> go<00:03:55.400> out

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
compact 12 Pro what you do is you go out

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.300 
compact 12 Pro what you do is you go out
of<00:03:55.670> your<00:03:55.819> mixer<00:03:56.299> into<00:03:56.989> let's<00:03:57.560> say<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:58.040> left

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
of your mixer into let's say the left

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.850 
of your mixer into let's say the left
channel<00:03:58.610> input<00:03:59.239> here<00:03:59.480> all<00:04:00.019> you<00:04:00.260> do<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:00.620> you'd

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
channel input here all you do then you'd

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.550 
channel input here all you do then you'd
get<00:04:01.069> an<00:04:01.280> audio<00:04:01.640> cable<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.299> go<00:04:02.480> from<00:04:03.019> full<00:04:03.290> range

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
get an audio cable to go from full range

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.350 
get an audio cable to go from full range
out<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.000> right<00:04:05.209> in<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:06.230> then<00:04:07.150> just<00:04:08.150> go

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
out to the right in and then just go

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.380 
out to the right in and then just go
from<00:04:08.930> here<00:04:09.489> into<00:04:10.489> one<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.849> satellites

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
from here into one of the satellites

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.140 
from here into one of the satellites
using<00:04:11.660> speak<00:04:12.079> on<00:04:12.290> from<00:04:13.220> here<00:04:13.400> into<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.940> other

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
using speak on from here into the other

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.849 
using speak on from here into the other
one<00:04:14.389> of<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.569> satellites<00:04:15.079> using<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:15.500> speakon

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
one of the satellites using the speakon

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.219 
one of the satellites using the speakon
connector<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.549> then<00:04:17.209> turn<00:04:17.630> your<00:04:17.750> volume<00:04:17.900> up

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
connector and then turn your volume up

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.279 
connector and then turn your volume up
so<00:04:18.579> instead<00:04:19.579> of<00:04:19.940> it<00:04:20.120> being<00:04:20.150> left<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:20.959> right

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
so instead of it being left and right

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.279 
so instead of it being left and right
where<00:04:21.769> stereo<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.669> concerned<00:04:23.150> both<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.169> these

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
where stereo is concerned both of these

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.469 
where stereo is concerned both of these
channels<00:04:24.830> for<00:04:25.340> example<00:04:25.400> could<00:04:25.910> be<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.300> on

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
channels for example could be just on

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.870 
channels for example could be just on
the<00:04:26.600> right<00:04:26.840> side<00:04:27.229> if<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:28.130> set<00:04:28.370> up<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.639> on<00:04:28.789> the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
the right side if this set up is on the

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.779 
the right side if this set up is on the
right<00:04:29.090> side<00:04:29.389> alternatively<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:31.160> left<00:04:31.490> side

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
right side alternatively the left side

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.279 
right side alternatively the left side
if<00:04:32.060> it's<00:04:32.450> on<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.720> left-hand<00:04:33.289> side<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.590> your<00:04:33.830> PA

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
if it's on the left-hand side of your PA

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.469 
if it's on the left-hand side of your PA
the<00:04:36.289> major<00:04:36.530> idea<00:04:37.010> behind<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.400> compact<00:04:37.820> 12<00:04:38.180> pro

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
the major idea behind a compact 12 pro

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.400 
the major idea behind a compact 12 pro
is<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.930> size<00:04:39.639> base<00:04:40.639> camp<00:04:40.970> two<00:04:41.810> satellites

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
is the size base camp two satellites

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.779 
is the size base camp two satellites
I'll<00:04:42.710> be<00:04:42.919> honest<00:04:43.190> with<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.610> could

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
I'll be honest with you you could

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.580 
I'll be honest with you you could
probably<00:04:44.000> put<00:04:44.389> that<00:04:44.539> on<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:44.810> front<00:04:44.990> seat<00:04:45.380> of

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
probably put that on the front seat of

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.050
