00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.050
 hello friends , another one has come 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.580
 I ordered my package wrapper from ebay site 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.770
 it cost me 64 dollars 90 cents 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 parcel to Belarus was getting 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.619
 56 days and here is a dual gamepad 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:43.440
 shock 4 well let's unpack and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:48.620
 let's see the gamepad we have packed such 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.620
 here is an interesting package 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.070
 so we have more gamepad box 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.840
 nothing is empty 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 we all remove the side of the gamepad from us 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.979
 white seller said it 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.830
 original as we are in fact we are now and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:23.750
 so let's see 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.750
 open so probably not with scissors 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.869
 work shape 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.869
 somehow dispense fingers 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:54.220
 so well, let's get so here with us 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.920
 empty in our set 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.490
 Yusb cable for recharging is not in 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:08.860
 complete it does not go but in our 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.860
 The kit includes instructions and the gamepad itself. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:24.320
 well done everything is fine everything 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.280
 well as the seller stated that 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.260
 this is the original 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:36.860
 they are fake from behind 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.959
 see the inscription sony ds 5 volts 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.040
 800 milliamper hours that is probably 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.640
 the battery here costs us 700 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.269
 milliamper hours so if you compare with 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.080
 original 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.380
 let's see the original we can 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.830
 too, the capacity of the people will be poorly visible 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.100
 let's say it 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.360
 5 volts 800 milliampere hours that is 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.370
 just like the battery here 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:14.170
 I have the same original gamepad 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.170
 time to put on the cover dressed Stick 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.770
 such rubber nakladochka play bye 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.420
 have not tried it yet but it seems to me that 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.260
 These rubber pads will be 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.860
 interfere with the game because they stick like that 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.420
 will not fully lie down will hurt 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.930
 I think they will need to be removed or 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:41.420
 you will need to remove the cover from the gamepad 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.640
 here or here these are rubber pads 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.270
 the pass will have to be removed so they don't 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.489
 disturbed during the game that very 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:56.060
 hurt I donâ€™t know the truth in these gamepads 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:59.060
 fixed the problem of sticking a stick here 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.890
 when gum there they break or not 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.170
 fixed it is not yet known but so 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.610
 so basically pleased with the package and now 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.310
 let's try this gamepad too 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.970
 to cover 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.570
 Here is such a white little case 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.150
 You can unpack this case 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:27.190
 see here from this video 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.190
 let's try to cover it with you now 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:45.860
 Here, in principle, I did everything on him 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:50.030
 now stick around the whole circle 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.530
 here and try to wear these here 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.889
 pink lining that came in the kit 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.790
 they are certainly uncomfortable and fingers with them 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:03.000
 will slide off but we'll see 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.389
 whether it will go completely stick yes in 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.960
 these overlays stick completely down 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:13.370
 but the minus of these overlays is that fingers from them 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.370
 will slide off 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:22.650
 gamepad turned on working all is well 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:25.169
 inadvertently pressed the ps button and on this 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.640
 we probably all subscribe to 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.700
 channel put likes 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.700
 all all bye and thanks for watching
