00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.549
 hello everyone with you fan planets and today 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.250
 there will be a review on an interesting game but before 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.879
 than to begin, I would like to recommend you 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.750
 wonderful channel called 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.150
 or 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.590
 we are a person doing various reviews on 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.630
 interesting games choirs 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.520
 all sorts of cool games in general 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 principle makes it a quality come 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.220
 and see subscribe link to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.290
 The channel in the description of the video game is called 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.849
 together force 2 is generally wonderful 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.059
 toy advise play hour see 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 still here generally there let's click 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.210
 play 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.530
 really such basically games on 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.300
 android do here and get a zombie 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.670
 survived as can be said here in general 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.329
 attacking zombies from all sides 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.100
 walk in the woods and shoot them and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.679
 Loved the great gameplay 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.929
 let's just click play and select 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.440
 wear with us a city of general already later 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.140
 open apparently I understand that's the same 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 here you can buy various weapons 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.739
 also liked 5 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.430
 let's click play 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.890
 the atmosphere in the game is really normal 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:17.829
 Now let's see for now what else is there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.079
 Here are the moisture settings in the game for them 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.270
 not quite directly what depends 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.310
 here moisture is mostly in the game and then 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.990
 because of the crowd zoom i mean of them too 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.009
 a lot just as if not calculated 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.009
 see the processor here is the number 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.009
 of objects 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.800
 here zombies are just a huge amount 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.080
 appears in the process of passing the game 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.210
 also here you can get off the barrels blow 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.280
 I liked it too, that is, the whole object 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.340
 and by the way active like but trees 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.490
 shoot the trees of course do not fall off 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.860
 here, in principle, did not do such things 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:00.200
 so now let's wait for the zombies he 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.910
 they are by the way marked on the map learn me 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.990
 liked it so come on now 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.380
 here that is a zombie when fired 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.200
 attributed here is not so stupid that 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.709
 you shoot and I donâ€™t know how to rock 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.020
 somehow 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.560
 here and zombies carry a shot like in 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.810
 real life in general really 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.600
 looks very realistic graphics in 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.930
 not really but graphics here for 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.299
 account fog say such here 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.370
 as if to remove the fog add 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.840
 lighting for example during the day there is a schedule 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.239
 it will look like this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.299
 standard nothing special due to 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.099
 fog it looks basically beautiful 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.750
 as we see here are pixel such 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.090
 trees close well this is because 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.879
 settings and stand on stand at minimum 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.489
 so at maximum settings principle 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.489
 It also goes when this creep begins 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.840
 not just a lot of them could 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.299
 by the way on the maximum put well 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.230
 Okay, in principle, so to everyone, as if 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.750
 less but I think that 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.239
 optimize this game no sense so 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.930
 same depends be his plagiarism 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.870
 a huge number of zombies so in 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.569
 Basically the game is generally very smooth 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.780
 what is at the minimum what is the maximum 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.469
 when so many zombies start 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.530
 go start the brakes when fired 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:26.359
 this communication is convenient ie it starts 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.979
 such a hangup that it doesn't even shoot 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:34.190
 perhaps now it is already beginning 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:38.139
 In principle, this is me because Dobrin 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.379
 roll off now, too, hung on the shot 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.379
 therefore so 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.950
 here is such a toy now let's 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.110
 studied still can be seen in principle 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.390
 that's all probably here's such 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.830
 great toy 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.050
 I liked the fact that you can blow up the barrels 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.930
 how to lure all the date 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.870
 then zombies and immediately you can blow that 10 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.050
 zombie that is it is very cool 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.530
 I liked the fact that the map was enough 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.340
 awesome in principle and style of graphics too 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.900
 in the fog normally that is it looks and 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.019
 the most important thing that liked the gameplay 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.090
 what kind of zombies do they carry when walking 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.400
 some kind of animation there are three here no 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.110
 go to experience 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.420
 trying to have this whole feeling of walking there 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.800
 Normally, the principle is made like this 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.780
 great toy advise not 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.370
 play this review is over 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.370
 subscribe to the channel all bye
