see<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> mostly<00:00:54.210> non<00:00:54.449> rare<00:00:54.690> team<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
see this is a mostly non rare team so

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.660 
see this is a mostly non rare team so
you<00:00:55.199> can't<00:00:55.469> expect<00:00:55.800> too<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.430> guys

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you can't expect too much in these guys

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
you can't expect too much in these guys
but<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.780> too<00:00:57.930> bad<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.410> decent<00:00:58.800> defending

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
but it's not too bad a decent defending

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
but it's not too bad a decent defending
decent<00:00:59.609> heading<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.750> need

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
decent heading which is what you need

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
with center backs and I may have lugano

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.800 
with center backs and I may have lugano
with<00:01:03.539> extremely<00:01:04.229> horrible<00:01:04.559> place<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.280> 47

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
with extremely horrible place here 47

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.020 
with extremely horrible place here 47
not<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> want<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> explained<00:01:08.939> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
not what you want but as I explained in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
not what you want but as I explained in
the<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.360> video<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.260> seems

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the first video as well it seems

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
the first video as well it seems
strength<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> heading<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.490> figure<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.909> are

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
strength and heading and figure that are

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.399 
strength and heading and figure that are
a<00:01:12.060> lot<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.330> important<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.080> centre

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
a lot more important for your centre

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.200 
a lot more important for your centre
backs<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.950> pace<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> still<00:01:14.790> nice<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
backs now and pace is still nice of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
backs now and pace is still nice of
course<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.020> important<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
course but it's not as important as it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.950 
course but it's not as important as it
used<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.159> decent<00:01:18.030> defending<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.689> heading

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
used to be decent defending and heading

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.469 
used to be decent defending and heading
not<00:01:19.439> too<00:01:19.619> great<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:19.979> overall<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.790> players<00:01:21.090> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
not too great so overall this players is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.020 
not too great so overall this players is
pretty<00:01:21.689> weak<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> view

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

which is quite nice passing not up there
and<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.329> figured<00:03:37.660> defending<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.350> course<00:03:38.560> who

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
and I figured defending of course who

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.120 
and I figured defending of course who
gives<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.130> because<00:03:39.250> he's<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> striker<00:03:39.880> I

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
gives a because he's a striker I

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.430 
gives a because he's a striker I
could<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.220> had<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:43.329> prohibitionist<00:03:44.200> team

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
could have had a a prohibitionist team

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.460 
could have had a a prohibitionist team
but<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.680> would<00:03:44.890> use<00:03:45.070> them<00:03:45.190> any<00:03:45.400> other

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
but I would use them any other

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.430 
but I would use them any other
in<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.070> other<00:03:47.160> squad<00:03:48.090> builder<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.020> I<00:03:49.050> figured

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
in the other squad builder so I figured

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.290 
in the other squad builder so I figured
I<00:03:49.560> wouldn't<00:03:49.740> use<00:03:49.950> him<00:03:50.100> this<00:03:50.250> time<00:03:50.460> I<00:03:51.060> could

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
I wouldn't use him this time I could

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.090 
I wouldn't use him this time I could
also<00:03:51.540> have<00:03:51.810> hungry<00:03:52.290> which<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.710> was<00:03:52.830> actually

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
also have hungry which I was actually

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.710 
also have hungry which I was actually
debating<00:03:53.460> but<00:03:53.970> then<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.180> would<00:03:54.240> have<00:03:54.360> to<00:03:54.480> get

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
debating but then I would have to get

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.640 
debating but then I would have to get
rid<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.980> Cavani<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.240> team<00:03:57.450> would

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
rid of Cavani and then this team would

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.780 
rid of Cavani and then this team would
basically<00:03:58.650> go<00:03:58.980> down<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.310> drain<00:03:59.400> because<00:03:59.520> of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
basically go down the drain because of

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.880 
basically go down the drain because of
Cavani<00:04:00.120> was<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.420> man<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.870> hour<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.590> this

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
Cavani was the man of the hour and this
