00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 honest with each other today I have for 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 you something completely new and indeed 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.950
 nail design tutorial what ourselves 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.139
 little wonder than I can barely 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.670
 believe I know has in fact significantly 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.230
 but well i thought i was trying 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.940
 Something new I have in my dm 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.220
 hoya these two things here from essens 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.980
 shown that are twice as large ne 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.910
 tigers and once such a lightning has grandpa 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.279
 in the head 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 well and i had the idea that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 I could do a tutorial on that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 many of you found the idea good and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.719
 asked for the video so here I am 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 I try to make this tutorial 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.469
 and my nails are we could see 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.680
 not painted and wait practically only 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.329
 still on it well to be raped 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 glistening from the sticker now from the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 here so we will let see quite 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.629
 ended we start with the first one 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 tutorial and these are these pretty ones 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.960
 stripes here you need to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.820
 any base i use to one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 very simple clear coat of manhattan 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.730
 I have been using it for a long time and I can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.710
 he also really recommend it completely 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.690
 nicely brings up in a pretty gloss 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 the girl and above all, he protects 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 which not then nail polish on 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.140
 I'm going to wear discolorations and stuff like that 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
 use it number one block for 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.890
 this tutorial and that is a very 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 beautiful opaque white nail polish me 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.100
 can highly recommend it because he as well 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 is very limited and unfortunately I have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 No cheaper alternative found 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.049
 because I just do not have any others 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.790
 used white nail polish but 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.560
 maybe you know well what and im 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
 focus of this tutorial 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.970
 of course these essens nailart stickers 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 there are four different colors and me 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.750
 will only times that use black 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 So of course I start with that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.270
 white nail polish over my pace 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.119
 first apply one at a time 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.680
 layer on two hands and then on 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.180
 one hand only the second layer 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.890
 nail polish so behind I have now 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.409
 two layers in front only one layer 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.299
 bite nail polish and I do that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.189
 because these stickers are really good 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.220
 so ever live on wet nail polish 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.530
 the wet nail polish the better 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.299
 well and the procedure is really 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.950
 very easily one of these stripes 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.649
 is enough for a whole hand we have 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:06.600
 a total of 24 strips so it's enough 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.039
 handy for twelve nail designs yes and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.560
 I 'll do it for the first time and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.950
 would have with it 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.319
 No problems I would become like that by now 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.599
 make me really nail 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.220
 and not per hand and always the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.880
 nail then paint the first 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.440
 stripes on it would be and then 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.730
 only the second nail polish would be hers 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 I think it's a bit easier 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.310
 but otherwise you can see it is 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.569
 pretty easy with the scissors 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.620
 I think you can do the sticker very well 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.300
 so they really do not attach 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.049
 fall so they really have 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.360
 fixed are pretty easy 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.900
 Everything so it did not take long 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.790
 and was actually quite talked about 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.140
 I have to say I recommend you 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.030
 every case a nail scissors for that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.220
 to use whole because that's so nice 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.870
 is small and rounded and so on 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.030
 You can turn the stripes into a beautiful one 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.730
 cut off the shape at the end if you have one 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.110
 have folded bit should I 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.940
 cotton pads are not good at all and in 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.910
 nail polish remover liquid drink 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.760
 You know the trick and then 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.890
 just drift 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.989
 Bisky patzer are gone and then you are 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.640
 finished small tip still used on 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.320
 definitely somewhere about was I've 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.880
 forget and you have that 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.530
 Forefinger can see a bit 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.329
 of the strip that unfortunately canceled 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.090
 So if you have such a protective layer over 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.549
 the strip job then he stops too 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.049
 of course you can too 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.680
 Use different colors to play 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.170
 around with it 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.040
 it's really fun bit 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.040
 experiment 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.040
 ok for the second nail design are these 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.230
 I use black glittery ones 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.970
 the essens effect nails that are to 3d 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.290
 Glitter in color 04 cuts 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.840
 midnight madden packaging is a 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.580
 a little bit battered but the packet 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.930
 is still intact and sees 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.940
 also really great so at least 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.110
 the middle of it, but still its pitfalls 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.760
 I'll come to that soon 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.879
 I also need black ones 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.220
 nail polish this is the color 144 black is 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.260
 back and again my clear coat of 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.629
 manhattan as base here you have the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.329
 base applied here a layer 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.060
 black nail polish and now I go 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.109
 so that I first my blitzer 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.400
 preparatory 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.380
 I thought that maybe 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.820
 smarter of the beginning when the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.100
 nails so the first layer already like that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.260
 a bit dried 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.260
 So you screwed this shutter haid 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.260
 and then there comes the glitter rows 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.729
 so it says the instructions and sees 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.720
 also really cool in the packaging 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.000
 So the glitter looks really great 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.550
 then applies for nail here first time 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.130
 my little finger with a second 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.410
 black layer and then I try 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.120
 somehow that nail in this glitter 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.380
 something to dunk not something like that 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.320
 easy because I was a bit too 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.410
 little of the glitter filled 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.030
 So optimization needs 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.770
 Here you see, comes a bit more in 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.000
 this packet in and then it works 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.460
 also easier and a bit 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.160
 faster, however, does not look that way 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.599
 super nice in the first moment goes 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.310
 but relatively fast, just look at them 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.910
 mess and I really tried 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.910
 to work properly 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.919
 ok very attractive and every case 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.570
 and now the problems were on 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.560
 how do you get that excess 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.990
 Glitter now at all of the 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.060
 fingernails from the packaging of 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.830
 Essens is that you have such an extra NEN 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.060
 But airbrush should use it for that 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.289
 I did not have it so I have it with me 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.849
 a brush has not tried 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.740
 also did not work with one 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.090
 At least, bodycheck does not work 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.389
 so I have water later 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.970
 but then get off as the nails 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.120
 clean were next problem of this 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.370
 blitzer goes off very fast and me 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.720
 had him everywhere and it was so annoying 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.700
 and my friend brings me and if he does 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.270
 home comes because everywhere glitter 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.120
 his 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.070
 Now again a problem how do I get 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.490
 this glitter again in the bun 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.790
 Well so man should this filter 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.040
 unscrew and then stop the 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.840
 excess blitzer particles the man 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.380
 did not use in the couple rows 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.230
 to fill 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.210
 yes that is somehow but 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.430
 somehow it is also a lot of magic and 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.510
 life is a bit too short for that 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.510
 So I find the end effect real 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.130
 beautiful just not for me 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.800
 beautiful enough to make me whole again to 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:28.610
 because the glitter just does not work 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.230
 holds well and it just glitters beautiful 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.220
 victims I find nice nail polish 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.220
 have the similar effect 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.330
 she likes to write in the comments 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.069
 which of the two luxury is better 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.469
 he liked the stripes or 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.120
 the one with the glitter and I hope we 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.529
 Please see us again in the next video 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.909
 Give the video a thumbs up if it is 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:49.139
 you liked it you already know that 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.139
 firmly to my dear ones
