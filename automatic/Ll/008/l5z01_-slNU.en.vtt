00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 there are very good all chavalerÃ­a and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.190
 back spartacus and commenting on a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.610
 boxing of a little thing that has come to me 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.550
 this morning is the logitech g19 keyboard 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 that I asked for it by amazon and good the truth 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.130
 is that it has surprised me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.039
 will come today because I had put on a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 Amazon message that arrived between the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.340
 February 10th and the 26th and it has 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 come on day 10 so I'm 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.539
 quite happy with the service 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 amazon so I'm going to proceed because 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 I want to see it and it costs about 180 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 more or less out there you can 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.630
 get it you can catch it also in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 logitech page you can get it 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 I suppose that in the English court and I have 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 caught by amazon and surely on ebay 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.539
 also this good here we have it come on 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.600
 to proceed to remove all 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.760
 wrappers to see my natural enemy 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.010
 ok here are the cables here there are more 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:59.000
 which cables are we going to take it out 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.879
 my beautiful mother how is this worth 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.089
 let's take this and take it out 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.089
 as well 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:15.010
 of one thing and we are also going to return it 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.040
 native here very well 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.710
 it is quite heavy of the truth I have not 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.930
 seen heavier keys but also 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.410
 it weighs quite a bit is quite firm so 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:32.840
 so much we're going to leave here where 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:35.719
 this would be the keyboard so I'm going to it 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.490
 the responsible ones we are going to put 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.880
 as well 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.409
 and then I proceed to connect it to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.490
 computer and I show you the functions that 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.720
 is having and all that has some 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.369
 backlighting and such and cons 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.640
 multimedia has here now you 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:58.020
 I will comment and it is worth this as it connects 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.350
 this must be like this I do not have insurance I think 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.550
 that is already good enough we put 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.110
 the sideburns here to make it more 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.270
 comfortable I could follow the dreams by 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.320
 behind him and we have the sideburns and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.140
 so these rails here are to go 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.970
 placing the cables and all that so that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.580
 do not get in the way of having about 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.100
 the table we put here and this is how it works 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.190
 very well then I understand it right now 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.390
 as you can see the father no and I'll tell you 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.739
 see how 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.630
 Well guys, we're already here 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.150
 I have installed italy had to put 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 the software but how come 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.630
 default for windows 7 I have had 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.950
 to go to the items page but 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.360
 well, there's no problem if it happens to you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610
 to you then to the page and there 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.080
 immediately you have it installed very fast 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.910
 in spanish everything so very well 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.560
 now I'm going to teach the functions that I already 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.360
 I have put a little bit everything to my liking 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.390
 customized there we would have the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.230
 backlight with these buttons 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.430
 here 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.500
 m1 m2 m3 contains a different set 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 of macros and activates the keys that are 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.099
 You are 12 here 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.290
 for example I in the m1 I have since 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.440
 you see recrimination in morality in the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.720
 m2 I have to see it in blue and in the m3 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.819
 I have to look green as you can 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.379
 see this is pretty good because of course 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.599
 you depend on the game you are playing and such 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.129
 Well, if you're playing at night and that's 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.690
 you can see the keys perfectly 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.930
 and such the space I do not know why it is not 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.610
 but well let's put one later 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.440
 has this key here that is for 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.239
 disable the windows key that yes 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.730
 sure that you can have many 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.980
 past this we have it activated so 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.980
 if we give the windows key , we do not know 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.329
 the menu appears as it is when 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.950
 we are playing minecraft or any 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.870
 thing that we do without wanting and we 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.480
 minimizes all the fishing and we finish 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.310
 losing now we're going well then 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.319
 we're going to take it out okay so we know 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.470
 activate we will move to this side of the 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.750
 keyboard here we have a roulette that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.250
 regulates the volume of the computer with this 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.500
 it silences it all now we can 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.420
 give again perfectly with these 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.390
 buttons here are multimedia controls 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.459
 with this we stop and move forward again 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.040
 with this we stop the video at all and 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.409
 with this we advance and pass images 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.170
 here the numerical part the buttons of 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.310
 address here we simply activate and 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.780
 deactivate now luce I do not know if I have 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.189
 said before I think so and now we're going 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.169
 with the most curious of the keyboard 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.759
 this is the screen that is a screen 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:23.280
 lcd of 320 x 240 pixels the audi tt 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:25.740
 15 this service 9 also has it but 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.330
 in this superior model then we have 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.970
 a menu that is controlled from these 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.440
 buttons here that you see oranges is worth 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.090
 example here we have a monitor of 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.930
 performance we are going to give 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.060
 and here it indicates us 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.500
 the performance that the cpi has the ram 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.060
 which is consuming right now as 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.289
 you can see there he has four stripes like that 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.020
 which I suppose will be consuming very 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.389
 little let's go back to the menu we have a 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.669
 multimedia screen a watch let's see 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.830
 a clock there marks us the time very well 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.360
 let's go back to video reproductions 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.259
 on YouTube this is a real kick 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.259
 and here we have a video 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.020
 plays on the screen and the sound of 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.940
 the video itself if you project us through 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.009
 from the speakers that the truth that is 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.250
 quite pretty well worth then what 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.930
 we are going to stop because we have come here 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.759
 We have left the viewer webcam 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.320
 we have a viewer image viewer 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.240
 of movies that here for us 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.680
 we can come to the movies and the 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.420
 videos that we have as you see 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.430
 here I have 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.940
 or the videos that I have of the channel and so 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.280
 I have far cry videos and all that and I'm going 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.200
 to put the final part of the videos by 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.529
 example that the elite of the other day there the 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.899
 we have but well 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:37.149
 there the image that you see is appearing 

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:40.280
 at the end of the videos is a reproduced 

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:43.490
 the sound here on the speakers 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.960
 there you can see it does not look very good 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.620
 bars maybe do not look tiny 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.430
 about a pillory, actually, let's go 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.430
 to stop this 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.919
 and now I'm going to show you around here 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.470
 or if we see it well it has two inputs 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.300
 usb I do not know what we can connect 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.850
 but I guess we'll find the 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.770
 utility and that I leave it to our 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.139
 discovery all good as this has 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.520
 been everything I hope you liked it 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.050
 I have also served you if you have any 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.060
 you can doubt me you can put the comments 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.919
 are the twitter that I'll leave it out there 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.689
 down in the description and now what 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.189
 I'll put in the video too 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.749
 I hope you liked it all 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.989
 soon with a new gameplay until not 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:22.989
 many
