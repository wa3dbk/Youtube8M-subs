00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello I'm francesca how many we will prepare 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.529
 together the pastry recipe 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.320
 the pastry just like many of you already 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.330
 they will know and used in the kitchen 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.700
 Italian for the preparation of many 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.680
 the most famous cakes is certainly the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.410
 tart but can also be used 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.809
 for various types of cookies to make it 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.210
 we will need 250 g of soft butter 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:37.809
 250 g of sugar a sachet of 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.649
 vanillina two beaten eggs a pinch 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.090
 of salt and half a kilo of flour 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.770
 let's start by putting in our own 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 planetary butter 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.720
 together with the butter we also add the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 vanillin and sugar 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.290
 and turn on our planetary 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.000
 we can start to put eggs in 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.530
 our dough before doing this 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.530
 add a pinch of salt 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.799
 add the eggs so that you 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.850
 dissolve then we can insert the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.850
 our new little by little 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.530
 and we wait until the egg has been incorporated 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.530
 before adding the rest 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.140
 if composed it tends to stop at the bottom 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.690
 of the planetary must stop the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.690
 planetary and with the help of a shovel 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.690
 budge 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.300
 and add the remaining egg 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.240
 at this point we just have to 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.160
 add the flour then stop it 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.200
 planetary 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.090
 we reach completely I recommend 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.090
 the sieved flour 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.270
 we add it completely and we do it 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.570
 start the minimum speed otherwise 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.300
 a dust would jump out and the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.430
 let's go until the flour is 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.430
 absorbed by the rest of the compound 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:02.709
 at this point we just have to take 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 a sheet of parchment paper pour over it 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.420
 our compound 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.239
 we can help ourselves with a spatula in 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.239
 plastic 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.419
 then we close it and put it to 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.449
 rest in the refrigerator for at least 12 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.449
 hours 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.490
 and our pastry is ready 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.770
 Now we just have to roll it out and is 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.999
 use it in the world we like best 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.310
 if you need any ideas 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.110
