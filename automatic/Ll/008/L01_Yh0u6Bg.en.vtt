00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.190
 and as in many Latin American countries in Mexico, only 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.300
 treatment to a minimum part of the water that the industries that use in their 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.670
 production process so a high concentration of pollution arrives 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.760
 directly to the rivers and those same waters are used for irrigation of 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.169
 crops 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.230
 the companies of the industrial corridor of the jump in the state of Jalisco to 

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.619
 west of mexico 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.619
 they discharge their residual waters in the river santiago 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.310
 and the tributaries of extermination 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.540
 They serve the peasants like Don Guillermo to irrigate thousands of hectares 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.730
 of various crops 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.760
 sowing 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.560
 forage sorghums 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.710
 alpha alpha to know more 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.490
 all those undocumented 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.410
 is your life of feeding people expressed their only resource 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.899
 there is no other tizi remedy 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.840
 while together with his companions he performs desazolve work 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.250
 In the channel 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.330
 We would like all farmers to want the water to return to 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.800
 be like 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.210
 thirty years or older 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 0 well, I think that this contamination is at the national level, not just at a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.960
 here 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.530
 they tell us that the Lerma river can not be found in the state of Mexico and that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.140
 been the same or worse 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.100
 indeed 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.110
 it's a national problem 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.520
 the industries only treat a minimum part of the water they use in their 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.410
 Productive processes 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.970
 there is no legislation 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.570
 that protects citizens 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.220
 a specific law 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.500
 to the companies caesar the waste 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.760
 what generates 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.850
 Given this reality, public institutions of higher education such as 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.780
 National Autonomous University of Mexico make efforts to develop 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.700
 wastewater treatment plants 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.970
 like this one that uses solar energy 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.970
 Unlike the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.500
 this treatment 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.850
 percent have drag benefit degrade organic compounds 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.180
 toxic 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.140
 totally up in the fish arlos to forms 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.259
 well minerals and seo2 dairy 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.399
 is based on the use of catalysts that are activated with 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.480
 solar radiation 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.769
 they will integrate toxic substances used for example 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.999
 the cash 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.190
 with pesticides 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.319
 for agricultural use 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.479
 still in the experimentation phase 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.430
 could become short 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.290
 in one of the water treatment technologies that is sorely lacking 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.540
 makes the country 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.909
