00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.950
 Hi, girls, this is what I came to show today. 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.769
 to you something I do not know the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.990
 instagram and the girls inspired and I 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.270
 I was super to do I played my 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.590
 makeup corner for various 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.750
 reasons 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.160
 only mainly because of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.590
 Illumination you know that I am 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.200
 trying to improve the illumination of my 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.419
 videos because it's still complicated 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.790
 but I think here relation to space 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.169
 lighting is to be able to work better 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.149
 so I pulled everything to the other side of the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.070
 room where I was counting here on the side 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.710
 It's where I left off and now it 's here. 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.989
 in that other corner that was remote nobody 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.089
 I did not see it then I changed everything I think 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.670
 It's better this way and after I've organized it 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:49.570
 cool high easy I got from music 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.809
 11 fourth jewelry design and makeup port 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.640
 incredible I remodeled it and solved it 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.440
 record a video for you to show 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.870
 because he is incredible he saved my 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.819
 Life I was in deep need of a 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.659
 space this my room to organize 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.909
 my stuff 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.080
 So he was super welcome and he is 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.909
 muito lindo 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.770
 the reality of music design stuff 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.670
 is kind of princess thing which the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.430
 super gorgeous dreams but it's me I 'm not 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.930
 so adept at everything so romantic so 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.640
 I like one a detail or another 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.440
 still likes contemporary thing 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.960
 but I thought he gave a touch of 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.180
 femininity was missing in the fourth 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.890
 I say without femininity of one more thing 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.070
 romantic that runs on the second I have 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.660

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.470
 I did not put it to the favela and never 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.410

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.430

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:57.300

 seeing a lot of things you've seen 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:10.980
 but i decided to put here thought 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.920
 It came out perfectly around here that side 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.020
 Here I am getting the hang of people here. 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.650

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.880
 here on this side is it possible to propose 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.500
 little chain that just as my clients 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.690
 are very large and I have decided to 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.810
 bracelet was so well with this flight 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.820
 a bouquet I understand is a bracelet 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.390
 has two sides this way is a 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.400
 door that then closes the front 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.400
 Look at being closed here has one here. 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.350
 which is an identical relic and is 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.480
 Way people are not funny, I'm 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.370
 thinking for a mirror here i think 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.130
 cool because of fishing from my 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.660
 time what he's so it's a mirror 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.940
 more to get me dressed 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.060
 I found it lovely here I mixed it 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.980
 He for accessory makeup by 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.500
 need what I needed to put 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.510
 here I found it cool to adapt from 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.640
 The way I was needing it is a 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.720
 tip very useful the rustic has a lot 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.190
 cool thing 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.169
 in addition the organizer has 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.020
 makeup room organizer only 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.200
 jewelry and fits pretty thing people 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.760
 Look, we have excellent dealings with you. 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.910
 You can withdraw but I think it's great. 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.600
 so I thought too much for me was a 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.830
 saved because my father was getting 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.290
 present impassable already on the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.110
 make-up mess so I found that 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.740
 this piece that was good as well 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:38.130
 better well more stabilized much more 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.400
 organized at last that looks 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.840
 it's loud I'll be at the time 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.310
 what are in the videos for you? 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.480
 I was thrilled I know it's going to shake a 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.180
 little but look understand by neighbor to 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.650
 height of him people he is really well 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.190
 great 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.699
 It's very tall that it fits a lot. 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.100
 two entrances there and there for chains 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.780
 so here all the drawer worth the super 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.510
 Too bad, I think the 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.620
 Rustic things have parks but also 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.020
 I fell in love 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.300
 I do not have a wall for him but I 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.820
 I fell in love in the same good way. 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.530
 Girls this is my new little corner, I know. 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.870
 he is not very good yet has 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.639
 enough to pack but not enough 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.889
 increase what you give to me will come 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.690
 so I think it 's better than 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.030
 record video like this 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.889
 organized now I hope you like it 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.889
 of the tips is this kiss kiss
