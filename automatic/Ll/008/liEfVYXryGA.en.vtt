00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.530 
3400 is a full-color printer

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.190 
3400 is a full-color printer
and<00:00:14.620> you<00:00:15.519> can<00:00:15.700> use<00:00:15.940> either<00:00:16.209> continuous<00:00:16.840> labels

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
and you can use either continuous labels

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.870 
and you can use either continuous labels
or<00:00:17.849> individual<00:00:18.849> labels<00:00:19.090> like<00:00:19.869> these<00:00:20.110> and<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880

ink<00:00:22.090> cartridge<00:00:22.630> loads<00:00:23.109> right<00:00:23.439> here<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.820> very

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
ink cartridge loads right here it's very

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.939 
ink cartridge loads right here it's very
easy<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.390> load<00:00:25.720> it's<00:00:26.170> got<00:00:26.349> all<00:00:26.470> three<00:00:26.650> colors

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
easy to load it's got all three colors

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:27.450 
easy to load it's got all three colors
in<00:00:27.130> it

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
in it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.430 
in it
and<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:29.320> a<00:00:29.439> drop-in<00:00:29.710> load<00:00:31.259> printer<00:00:32.259> also

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and it's a drop-in load printer also

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.439 
and it's a drop-in load printer also
take<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> role<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> labels<00:00:35.940> which<00:00:36.149> could<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
take the role of labels which could be

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:44.619 
take the role of labels which could be
any<00:00:36.629> course<00:00:36.989> size<00:00:39.350> just<00:00:40.350> drop<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.780> so

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
any course size just drop it in like so

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.979 
any course size just drop it in like so
so<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.960> SI<00:00:46.140> 3400<00:00:47.010> allows<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.719> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
so the SI 3400 allows for the use of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.959 
so the SI 3400 allows for the use of
various<00:00:49.559> media<00:00:49.949> types<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.519> of<00:00:50.549> them<00:00:50.760> being

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
various media types one of them being

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.770 
various media types one of them being
continuous<00:00:51.870> labels<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.390> allows

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
continuous labels and what that allows

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.979 
continuous labels and what that allows
you<00:00:55.049> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.329> flexible<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.930> your

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you to do is be more flexible with your

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.759 
you to do is be more flexible with your
design<00:00:58.409> in<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.680> labels<00:00:59.870> right<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.589> our

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
design in your labels right now on our

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.499 
design in your labels right now on our
screen<00:01:02.010> we've<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.729> barcode<00:01:03.180> label<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
screen we've got a barcode label a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.010 
screen we've got a barcode label a
full-color<00:01:06.509> image<00:01:07.100> which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.130> our<00:01:08.640> post<00:01:09.570> puppy

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
full-color image which is our post puppy

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.100 
full-color image which is our post puppy
right<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.940> so<00:01:11.940> I'm<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.390> enlarge<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.990> as

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
right here so I'm going to enlarge it as

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
right here so I'm going to enlarge it as
much<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.640> big<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.300> on<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
much as I can as big as I can on the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
much as I can as big as I can on the
screen<00:01:18.020> like<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
screen like that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:36.890 
screen like that
go<00:01:21.060> ahead<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.359> print<00:01:21.570> one

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.920 

so<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.530> label<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.950> printed<00:01:38.370> as<00:01:38.490> close<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.330> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so the label is printed as close to the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
so the label is printed as close to the
design<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.590> possible

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
design as possible

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.830 
design as possible
so<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.230> I'll<00:01:43.350> adjust<00:01:43.650> it<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.840> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so now I'll adjust it a little bit to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.660 
so now I'll adjust it a little bit to
make<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.350> artwork<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.100> label<00:01:47.370> itself

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
make the artwork or the label itself

00:01:47.670 --> 00:02:00.760 
make the artwork or the label itself
smaller<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.710> screen

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.550 

so<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:01.430> we're<00:02:01.579> using<00:02:01.610> less<00:02:02.090> space<00:02:02.540> on<00:02:03.229> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
so now we're using less space on the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.389 
so now we're using less space on the
label<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.990> less<00:02:05.990> label<00:02:06.439> period<00:02:06.680> or<00:02:07.070> receipt

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
label and less label period or receipt

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.749 
label and less label period or receipt
paper<00:02:07.579> whichever<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.920> then<00:02:10.429> when<00:02:10.610> we

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
paper whichever it is and then when we

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.020 
paper whichever it is and then when we
print<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.920> actually<00:02:13.430> automatically

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
print this it actually automatically

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.380 
print this it actually automatically
trims<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.260> extra<00:02:16.569> space<00:02:17.569> around<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.440> design

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
trims the extra space around the design

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
trims the extra space around the design
which<00:02:20.390> helps<00:02:20.750> minimize<00:02:21.230> waste

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.280 

and<00:02:26.640> there<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.420> is

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.080 

there's<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.129> comparison<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:35.970> other

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
there's the comparison with the other

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.339 
there's the comparison with the other

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349
