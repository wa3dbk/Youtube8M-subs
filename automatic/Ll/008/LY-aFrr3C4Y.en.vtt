 when I speak of love here

 if you think about this different love 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.720
 is that I usually do not go out until difficult what the price settles now 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.500
 can express in this question of love even more 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380
 that the woman has been 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.480
 a series of images and space to them 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.810
 with myths and beliefs that the woman 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.370
 goes growing and goes away what we what what is a myth 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.130
 trio who wanted us to be a myth that the woman has is that I think 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.100
 promises to reveal she believes man 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.250
 before the other is to determine 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.320
 no I do not know I'm not saying that little I know I know where 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.440
 which are myths that when people are approaching this female universe 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 we realize that the woman has some images 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.549
 Remember that one of the girl here that is going crazy 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.549
 of the tight daisy of the guild wants me badly wants to know me 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.189

 well you want me badly you want me there you want me badly want me 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.760
 In my imagination, I take every time I do not do it already in law. 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.119
 so I'm not saying anything much 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.419
 well I want it badly wants me and he must determine how bad he wants to be. 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.189
 me it's a viral disease 4 it's time to call in advance 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.200

 never 9th bpm captain of the tri 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.320
 What is this he wants to do with me or is he not going to want me? 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.380
 to understand the next secret world in the background in the background the woman always thinks 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.699
 Is that the chosen one? 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.359
 she often leaves the woman there 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.989
 the snake woman 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.419
 ends up living life without realizing it 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.740
 Good, but let's do it any way he wants. 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.990
 or let me see will it be that he will want me even or 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.749
 he does not want to look at me, what are you doing? 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.819
 It's very easy to feel women do not care what we read 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.430
 passion suffering passion and love of suffering for this explains sertÃ£o 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:17.779
 it seems that a 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.510
 It's like a city. 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.729
 love 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:25.439
 I really sensed love is as if I had to feel through suffering 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:30.849
 human fossil with love that comes through suffering because it's there I have 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.179
 his measure 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.759
 and I do not have the measure of love alone wanted and this is one of the things that 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:36.980
 I put it in the book 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.319
 its development such possibility 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.989
 Sindiferro cushion the love I think 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.639
 woman and to die she is something so beautiful and so associated it is as if 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.339
 was a synonym 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:53.189
 woman love woman love 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.060
 From this we are talking about female density and being female. 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:03.370
 being a woman comes to participate also diego a series of instances I com 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.089

 do you think I'm a woman? 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.989
 is what this woman produces is what this woman lived in terms of 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.859
 feelings and it is what this woman has as a mental saint is a classic that the 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.049
 people commit the very basics 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.759
 classic that most of the time is repeated 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 it's often good to see 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.680
 deny the harmonious relationship 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.350
 how legal is how important the slow-moving emotional life is important 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.529
 sometimes even 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.159
 and behind 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.719
 our life going after a 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.940
 relationship of a marriage of a family 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.139
 or something was I 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.860

 my wife here all night in the 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.189
 but 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:55.550
 detour at the time you say 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.950
 the feminine soul that most moved you that more full 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:01.889

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.649
 one of my great grandparents arrived today 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:18.409
 And you, what do you think 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.870
 I had the privilege of being able to understand what is behind what 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:29.269
 also may have passed this woman and especially be able to offer this to 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:32.289
 women's and men's names eye 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.439
 and I'm sure they existed 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.110
 If we say that people are so complicated then we suddenly have a 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.050
 paper here 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.060
 It's what can help. 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.339
 Do you have anything against self-help books? 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.289
 looks 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.110
 I think it's cramped help. 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.630
 ambulances are a new tool have already been more successful than with 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.740
 writers authors other than those who fail 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.020
 that the books are self-help but followed for example 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.280
 because it can not be a book katy perry if he arme help is radically the 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.620
 not self-help book why then what jn had to swallow the precise 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.980
 to have recipes in itself does not have that side has no revenue 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.050
 it simply correlates it reports icesave team 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.610
 I end up taking in the text 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.629
 the person proves to be in the legs if he realizes when he remembers things or is not 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.660
 a self-help book but it's a book that will house the woman 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.570
 to understand each other a little better and the man stop talking that we are complicated 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.280
 this is what this is the second document development book 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.230
 staff I think it was more difficult here a more difficult word to get a 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.940
 But I know Jack well generalized it seems that the study with 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.260
 toledo for this self-help book interdicted tourism chile was the woman and 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.080
 their secrets is to write the preface is obvious from them thank you very much for your
