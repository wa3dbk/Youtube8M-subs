00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.960
 hi how are you 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:08.530
 I'm going to show you the repetition of a 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.490
 attack that they made me with 36 wolves 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.620
 level 5 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.610
 mainly and two fury spells 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.170
 Level 2 also involved a magician and a 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.910
 goalkeeper 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.130
 the magician level 3 and the archer at level 5 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.099
 good complete destruction I was robbed 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 very elixir as you can see 183,000 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.370
 and let's see how how was this 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.530
 spectacular attack 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.680
 loose on the side where my defense is 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.160
 air all your balloons the air defense 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.610
 try to defend 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.739
 but it is impossible right there is 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.380
 when they release me on every defense 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.380
 aerial the spell of fury 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.610
 how do I have the defense 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.340
 meeting 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.829
 it's easier for 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.659
 for the balloons destroy it 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.870
 the defense tries to do what it can 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.790
 the tower of wizards fights the end 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.860
 well the tower of magicians made a 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.620
 important destruction but it was not 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.080
 enough was the last one left ping 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.090
 that's how my elixir went 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.790
 released a magician when the defense 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.250
 it was destroyed that is a good idea 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.910
 because the level 3 magician has a level of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910
 important destruction 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.869
 and nothing if they were finishing little by little 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.869
 separated into two groups 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.409
 I had the empty castle 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 the previous attack was also with 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.600
 many balloons but I won 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.630
 and so they took elixir the magician came 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.020
 over here where is my giant bomb and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 there it was 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 a basically that's how they destroyed 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.710
 everything can already be imagined as finished 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.710
 his story 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.720
 but let's see 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.930
 what happened in the previous attack in which 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.930
 I win 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.489
 because as you can see they attacked me with 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.489
 31 low level 5 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.690
 there it is we are going to see it 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.380
 this player tries to do the same 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.959
 only that he released all of them 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.850
 balloons towards a good let go of others 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.030
 also but he gave a lot of time to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.160
 just the strongest 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.950
 to my defense it would be stronger 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.810
 by not having the fury spells good 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 had application troops or can see 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 many archers 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.670
 likewise the tower of magicians the two 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.590
 towers of magicians played a role 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.590
 important because they weakened them a lot 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.370
 he let loose many archers also their 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.360
 troops of him 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.360
 from the tower 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.800
 and let's see what happened 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.800
 there are 33 seconds left wow 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.470
 Actually I think that I 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.190
 the troops of the castle did the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.610
 difference in this 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.700
 and well he did not have the fury spells 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.500
 which, as you can see, are very effective with 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.720
 balloons 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.720
 good an intense fight here 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.570
 but we still had defenses 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.780
 and we won it 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.890
 I was much more cut this second 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.300
 second repetition 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.300
 but nothing is all 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.610
 I am a cloak of the Tahuantinsuyo clan 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.510
 And until next time
