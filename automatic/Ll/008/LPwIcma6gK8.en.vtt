some cutting out right in here and get
rid<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.120> rust<00:00:51.539> there's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.320> couple<00:00:52.590> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
rid of this rust there's a couple of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
rid of this rust there's a couple of
hoes<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> I'll<00:00:54.690> cut<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.079> out

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
will me a new piece of metal in there

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.479 
will me a new piece of metal in there
that's<00:00:59.520> when<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.699> fix<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> new<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.180> now<00:01:00.359> er<00:01:00.899> go

get<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:26.100> rust<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.930> start

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
get that out little rust in there start

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
get that out little rust in there start
going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> mock<00:01:28.200> me<00:01:28.380> cut<00:01:29.070> me<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> piece<00:01:29.400> of

going to mock me cut me on a piece of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:02:33.870 
going to mock me cut me on a piece of
metal<00:01:29.610> here<00:01:30.409> we<00:01:31.409> go

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880

cleaned up got some rest reform on it

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.330 
cleaned up got some rest reform on it
treating<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.329> rust<00:02:41.510> there<00:02:41.890> made<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.100> piece

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
treating the rust there made this piece

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.860 
treating the rust there made this piece
right<00:02:43.610> here<00:02:46.000> which<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.180> going<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.450> go<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:47.720> there

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
right here which is going to go in there

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.670 
right here which is going to go in there
like<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:50.000> cut<00:02:50.269> that<00:02:50.390> out<00:02:50.500> make<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
like that you know cut that out make it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.110 
like that you know cut that out make it
match<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.100> piece<00:02:52.370> here<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:52.610> come<00:02:52.880> out<00:02:53.000> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
match this piece here that come out of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.860 
match this piece here that come out of
here<00:02:53.239> originally

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.420 

so<00:02:56.870> yeah<00:02:58.000> I'll<00:02:59.000> get<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.329> cut<00:02:59.540> on<00:02:59.630> out<00:03:00.430> start

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
so yeah I'll get that cut on out start

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.520 
so yeah I'll get that cut on out start
wheeling<00:03:01.579> that<00:03:01.700> bad<00:03:01.910> boy<00:03:05.230> all<00:03:06.230> right<00:03:06.260> that's

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
wheeling that bad boy all right that's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.309 
wheeling that bad boy all right that's
what<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.680> come<00:03:06.859> up<00:03:06.920> with

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
what I come up with

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.869 
what I come up with
after<00:03:08.950> cutting<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.340> grinding

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.530
