00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
 who accompanies the world manual gil does 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.359
 15 days or so when posting a 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.649
 photo on facebook showing that I tried 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.840
 solve the magic cube and it's over 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.300
 smashing the plastic of trying 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.549
 Enem now I trained a lot and I'm going 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.410
 show you that I can solve the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.410
 that's more or less in 11 minutes 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:32.829
 [Music] 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 if you know a new one well you know 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.760
 that it was just an assembly 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 that really solved the magician was the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
 renan right and has already won three championships 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 Brazilians as magical and physical and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
 organized the 1st magic championship here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.629
 in Brazil 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000
 he does it in less than ten minutes 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 each with his personal record in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.949
 What was the time to solve the fastest? 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 then the championships officially but is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.189
 The faster it was innocuous, 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.400
 bark quieter up to eight 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.400
 weeks 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.860
 and how long have you been riding without 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.200
 fast this way so I 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.729
 I started in 2007 the first time 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 I marked the time like this after a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 week 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.930
 already in order to escape three minutes three 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.210
 a little after about five more months 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.479
 It is not doing about 30 seconds in 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.720
 service there for download from 20 to 10 was 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.970
 defined much later than the 300 form 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.280
 go out with the best but only the person has 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.410
 Nothing sucks can solve in 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420
 less than three minutes and gives a 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.540
 common person if in all his ability 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.909
 can you detran if you say that 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.800
 week I will learn to speak in after 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.960
 one week the same is resolved in 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.149
 two minutes and you can decorate 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.410
 all the positions of all quadrants 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.229
 women 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.080
 so we consume at least 15 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.550
 easy to solve the industry provides the first 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.500
 and part of the second 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.970
 we anticipate the first page to 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.040
 people start the second phase the first 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.989
 million money in the second 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.030
 Ninety to do it in 10 seconds 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.959
 depending on how many turns and the 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.989
 then on average given us around 40 to 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.480
 50 to face something else I realized 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.820
 that this one of yours as it moves very smooth 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.299
 It's nice to mess with what I 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.750
 I bought it for $ 5 and it did not work. 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.120
 eita what I heard different people who 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.700
 buy at the corner store 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.110
 first who cared about the next 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.960
 to feel like 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.250
 was false here then so it is very 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.260
 different than this opportunity of 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.870
 four you already caught fire do so 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.120
 That this is chat will blow if you let 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.000
 to align it will act it will also act 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.850
 received with the whole system of this prevents 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.060
 that he michael vick here you have 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.030
 several other very crazy common 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.100
 these courses are very good but do not 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.250
 much harder to assemble this one 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.950
 for example the time that takes longer 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:28.770
 at one time in life but the delay in 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:36.680
 I'll be back for a couple of hours. 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:36.680
 here 12 for 2 to 1 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:50.069
 [Music] 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.930
 so let's do it, I'll continue the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.879
 next video is what to explain 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.160
 to us how it solves like magic 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.870
 We are going to do a super video one 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.390
 detailed but every teacher wants to 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.910
 first contact with the first notion of 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.370
 how can you solve an issue 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.269
 leaving a click of the next video here 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.580
 down 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.569
 And more this starts here you find 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.569
 a logo 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:28.189

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.060
