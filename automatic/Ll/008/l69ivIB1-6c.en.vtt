00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
curl the better and the way I like to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.459 
curl the better and the way I like to
curl<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> hair<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.610> actually<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.690> taking<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
curl the hair is actually by taking the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.869 
curl the hair is actually by taking the
curling<00:00:52.770> iron<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.100> wrapping<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> hair

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
curling iron and wrapping the hair

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.790 
curling iron and wrapping the hair
around<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.390> curling<00:00:54.480> iron<00:00:54.870> instead<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.559> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
around the curling iron instead of in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
around the curling iron instead of in
the<00:00:56.100> barrel<00:00:56.489> taking<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> clip<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.960> curling

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the barrel taking the clip and curling

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720 
the barrel taking the clip and curling
it<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> bottom<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> curl<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it from the bottom when you curl the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
it from the bottom when you curl the
hair<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> bottom<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.719> curl<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.170> sits

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
hair from the bottom the curl just sits

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
hair from the bottom the curl just sits
at<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> bottom<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> actually<00:01:02.730> take

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
at the bottom but if you actually take

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.119 
at the bottom but if you actually take
the<00:01:03.239> barrel<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> hold<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> against<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.830> scalp

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the barrel and hold it against the scalp

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
the barrel and hold it against the scalp
or<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> weft<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.260> wrap<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
or the top of the weft and then wrap the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
or the top of the weft and then wrap the
hair<00:01:08.220> around<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.760> barrel<00:01:08.939> it'll<00:01:09.390> give<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
hair around the barrel it'll give it a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
hair around the barrel it'll give it a
more<00:01:09.900> even<00:01:10.260> curl<00:01:10.530> along<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> whole<00:01:11.490> shaft<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
more even curl along the whole shaft of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
more even curl along the whole shaft of
the<00:01:12.180> hair<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.409> help<00:01:13.710> blend<00:01:14.070> your

will see more in the video I will show
you<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> clip<00:01:22.320> my<00:01:22.470> extensions

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you but I like to clip my extensions

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
you but I like to clip my extensions
right<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.700> top<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> other<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
right one on top of the other I think it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
right one on top of the other I think it
blends<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.530> better<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:26.130> shorter<00:01:26.460> hair<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
blends much better for shorter hair I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.640 
blends much better for shorter hair I
have<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> tutorial<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> clip<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.619> your

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
blend into the hair extensions I want

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.850 
blend into the hair extensions I want
them<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.480> kind<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.750> fold<00:03:21.050> into<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.709> hair

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
them to kind of fold into the hair

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.070 
them to kind of fold into the hair
extensions<00:03:22.400> so<00:03:23.000> that's<00:03:23.209> why<00:03:23.360> I'm<00:03:23.540> curling

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
extensions so that's why I'm curling

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.210 
extensions so that's why I'm curling
them<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.590> way<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.130> suggest<00:03:25.820> doing<00:03:26.150> like<00:03:27.220> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
them this way I suggest doing like the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.030 
them this way I suggest doing like the
gear<00:03:28.400> curls<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:29.720> forward<00:03:30.320> one<00:03:30.530> backwards

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
gear curls one forward one backwards

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.010 
gear curls one forward one backwards
even<00:03:31.640> though<00:03:31.760> all<00:03:32.060> these<00:03:32.270> ones<00:03:32.570> I'm<00:03:32.750> doing

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
even though all these ones I'm doing

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.230 
even though all these ones I'm doing
kind<00:03:33.320> of<00:03:33.410> backward<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.070> just<00:03:34.610> don't<00:03:34.760> want<00:03:34.940> my

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
kind of backward I just don't want my

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.690 
kind of backward I just don't want my
hair<00:03:36.200> natural<00:03:36.650> hair<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.950> kind<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.190> blend<00:03:37.459> all

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
hair natural hair to kind of blend all

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.120 
hair natural hair to kind of blend all
in<00:03:37.970> together<00:03:38.120> but<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.810> can<00:03:38.930> see<00:03:38.990> it's<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
in together but as you can see it's the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.370 
in together but as you can see it's the
the<00:03:40.430> ends<00:03:40.730> of<00:03:40.820> my<00:03:40.850> hair<00:03:41.000> are<00:03:41.330> folding<00:03:41.870> nicely

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
the ends of my hair are folding nicely

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.170 
the ends of my hair are folding nicely
into<00:03:42.860> the<00:03:42.980> extension<00:03:43.310> hair<00:03:43.670> these<00:03:43.910> are<00:03:44.060> my

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
into the extension hair these are my

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.330 
into the extension hair these are my
longer<00:03:44.540> pieces<00:03:44.870> at<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.140> top<00:03:45.350> because<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.070> have

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
longer pieces at the top because I have

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.880 
longer pieces at the top because I have
or<00:03:47.150> these<00:03:47.750> are<00:03:47.870> my<00:03:47.990> longer<00:03:48.290> pieces<00:03:48.530> at<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
or these are my longer pieces at the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.380 
or these are my longer pieces at the
front<00:03:49.100> because<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.310> have<00:03:49.459> an<00:03:49.580> angled<00:03:49.940> bob<00:03:50.150> so

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
front because I have an angled bob so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.430 
front because I have an angled bob so
these<00:03:50.510> are<00:03:50.630> going<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.810> be<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> little<00:03:51.140> bit<00:03:51.290> more

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
these are going to be a little bit more

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.800 
these are going to be a little bit more
easy<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.040> blend<00:03:52.580> my<00:03:52.850> natural<00:03:53.330> hair<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.690> my

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
easy to blend my natural hair and my

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.470 
easy to blend my natural hair and my
extension<00:03:54.170> hair<00:03:54.470> are<00:03:54.620> layered<00:03:55.240> but<00:03:56.240> as<00:03:56.360> you

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
extension hair are layered but as you

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.570 
extension hair are layered but as you
can<00:03:56.600> see<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.900> backs<00:03:57.140> pieces<00:03:58.010> are<00:03:58.190> really

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
can see the backs pieces are really

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.640 
can see the backs pieces are really
short<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.090> I'm<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.780> kind<00:04:00.020> of<00:04:00.080> giving<00:04:00.500> these<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
short so I'm just kind of giving these a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.130 
short so I'm just kind of giving these a
little<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.160> of<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:02.030> curl<00:04:02.450> at<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.780> bottom<00:04:03.110> just

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
little bit of a curl at the bottom just

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.930 
little bit of a curl at the bottom just
to<00:04:03.440> see<00:04:03.740> how<00:04:03.950> they're<00:04:04.100> going<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.340> blend<00:04:04.640> with

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
to see how they're going to blend with

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.590 
to see how they're going to blend with
my<00:04:05.209> extension<00:04:06.050> hair<00:04:06.940> they're<00:04:07.940> not<00:04:08.150> blending

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
my extension hair they're not blending

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.320 
my extension hair they're not blending
too<00:04:08.840> perfectly<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:10.070> will<00:04:10.370> move<00:04:10.820> on<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.120> my

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
too perfectly so I will move on to my

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.560 
too perfectly so I will move on to my
next<00:04:11.360> step<00:04:11.959> which<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.650> making<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.970> extensions

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
next step which is making the extensions

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.979 
next step which is making the extensions
blend<00:04:14.989> more<00:04:15.380> with<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.250> actual<00:04:16.970> hair<00:04:17.239> itself

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
blend more with the actual hair itself

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.500 
blend more with the actual hair itself
now<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.620> I've<00:04:18.739> curled<00:04:19.070> kind<00:04:19.520> of<00:04:19.609> all<00:04:19.820> around

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
now that I've curled kind of all around

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.330 
now that I've curled kind of all around
my<00:04:20.660> natural<00:04:21.109> hair<00:04:21.290> I'm<00:04:21.470> going<00:04:21.739> through<00:04:22.070> my

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
my natural hair I'm going through my

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.920 
my natural hair I'm going through my
extension<00:04:23.210> hair<00:04:23.390> and

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
extension hair and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.020 
extension hair and
I'm<00:04:24.080> gonna<00:04:24.289> give<00:04:24.530> these<00:04:24.680> more<00:04:25.220> curls<00:04:25.759> because

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
I'm gonna give these more curls because

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.270 
I'm gonna give these more curls because
I<00:04:26.240> just<00:04:26.539> let<00:04:26.750> my<00:04:26.870> extensions<00:04:27.440> sit<00:04:27.740> with<00:04:27.919> curls

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
I just let my extensions sit with curls

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.770 
I just let my extensions sit with curls
I<00:04:28.490> just<00:04:28.699> always<00:04:28.880> have<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> curl<00:04:29.479> in<00:04:29.509> my

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
I just always have a curl in my

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.939 
I just always have a curl in my
extension<00:04:30.410> I<00:04:30.500> don't

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
extension I don't

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.300 
extension I don't
I<00:04:30.979> rarely<00:04:31.610> wash<00:04:31.940> them<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.889> it's<00:04:33.889> easier<00:04:34.160> to

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
I rarely wash them and it's easier to

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.070 
I rarely wash them and it's easier to
have<00:04:34.490> curly<00:04:34.910> extensions<00:04:35.479> with<00:04:35.750> shorter<00:04:36.050> hair

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
have curly extensions with shorter hair

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.010 
have curly extensions with shorter hair
it<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:36.530> blends<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.100> much<00:04:37.280> better<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.780> am

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
it just blends that much better so I am

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.980 
it just blends that much better so I am
actually<00:04:39.289> taking<00:04:39.860> my<00:04:40.310> hair<00:04:40.669> my<00:04:41.300> extension<00:04:41.870> I'm

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
actually taking my hair my extension I'm

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.779 
actually taking my hair my extension I'm
actually<00:04:42.229> taking<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.889> top<00:04:43.130> layers<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.490> my

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
actually taking the top layers of my

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.150 
actually taking the top layers of my
extension<00:04:44.300> hair<00:04:44.509> and<00:04:44.740> wrapping<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.889> curling

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
extension hair and wrapping the curling

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.909 
extension hair and wrapping the curling
iron<00:04:46.520> around<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.479> extension<00:04:48.020> hair<00:04:48.259> and<00:04:48.500> the

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
iron around the extension hair and the

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.100 
iron around the extension hair and the
reason<00:04:49.250> I'm<00:04:49.340> doing<00:04:49.520> this<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:50.090> that<00:04:50.419> while<00:04:51.080> I

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
reason I'm doing this is that while I

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.469 
reason I'm doing this is that while I
when<00:04:51.500> you<00:04:51.530> wrap<00:04:51.919> your<00:04:52.160> hair<00:04:52.460> around<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
when you wrap your hair around the

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.960 
when you wrap your hair around the
actual<00:04:53.690> barrel<00:04:54.410> instead<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.979> clipping<00:04:55.550> out<00:04:55.789> at

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
actual barrel instead of clipping out at

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.089 
actual barrel instead of clipping out at
the<00:04:56.090> end<00:04:56.270> like<00:04:56.870> I<00:04:57.050> said<00:04:57.259> before<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.680> gives<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.009> a

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
the end like I said before it gives it a

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.640 
the end like I said before it gives it a
more<00:04:58.370> even<00:04:58.910> curl<00:04:59.300> along<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.870> whole<00:05:00.110> shaft<00:05:00.410> of

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
more even curl along the whole shaft of

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.469 
more even curl along the whole shaft of
the<00:05:00.770> hair<00:05:00.949> and<00:05:01.190> this<00:05:01.639> will<00:05:01.849> help<00:05:02.090> give<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.330> a

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
the hair and this will help give it a

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.260 
the hair and this will help give it a
curl<00:05:02.720> at<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:02.930> root<00:05:03.320> which<00:05:03.650> will<00:05:04.220> help<00:05:04.880> your

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
curl at the root which will help your

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.890 
curl at the root which will help your
natural<00:05:05.690> hair<00:05:05.930> blend<00:05:06.770> or<00:05:07.130> fold<00:05:07.699> into<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
natural hair blend or fold into the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.330 
natural hair blend or fold into the
extension<00:05:09.289> hair<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.740> that's<00:05:09.830> kind<00:05:10.130> of<00:05:10.190> what

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
extension hair and that's kind of what

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.129 
extension hair and that's kind of what
we<00:05:10.430> wanted<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.729> achieve<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:11.389> make<00:05:11.599> it<00:05:11.810> look<00:05:11.990> as

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
we wanted to achieve to make it look as

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.320 
we wanted to achieve to make it look as
seamless<00:05:12.620> as<00:05:12.770> possible<00:05:12.889> but<00:05:13.789> you<00:05:13.849> just<00:05:14.090> want

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
seamless as possible but you just want

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.909 
seamless as possible but you just want
to<00:05:14.360> make<00:05:14.509> sure<00:05:14.539> that<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.990> top<00:05:15.229> layers<00:05:15.560> of<00:05:15.680> the

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
to make sure that the top layers of the

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.860 
to make sure that the top layers of the
extension<00:05:16.370> hair<00:05:16.550> are<00:05:16.729> as<00:05:16.910> curly<00:05:17.330> as<00:05:17.419> possible

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
extension hair are as curly as possible

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.050 
extension hair are as curly as possible
I<00:05:17.960> do<00:05:18.020> actually<00:05:18.380> suggest<00:05:19.099> curling<00:05:19.910> them

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
I do actually suggest curling them

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.839 
I do actually suggest curling them
tighter<00:05:20.330> than<00:05:20.539> this<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.960> use<00:05:21.289> a<00:05:21.530> inch<00:05:22.250> barrel

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
tighter than this I use a inch barrel

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.180 
tighter than this I use a inch barrel
curling<00:05:23.449> iron<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:24.050> suggest<00:05:24.800> using<00:05:25.009> a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
curling iron I suggest using a

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.800 
curling iron I suggest using a
three-quarter<00:05:25.759> inch<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:26.150> way<00:05:26.330> you'll<00:05:26.479> get<00:05:26.660> a

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
three-quarter inch that way you'll get a

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.960 
three-quarter inch that way you'll get a
much<00:05:27.199> tighter<00:05:27.530> curl<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.070> it'll<00:05:28.280> blend<00:05:28.550> that

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
much tighter curl and it'll blend that

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.659 
much tighter curl and it'll blend that
much<00:05:29.240> better<00:05:29.510> when<00:05:29.840> you<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.139> a<00:05:30.440> tighter<00:05:31.310> curl

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
much better when you have a tighter curl

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.600 
much better when you have a tighter curl
in<00:05:32.449> your<00:05:32.479> extensions<00:05:33.349> so<00:05:33.680> as<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.460> see

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
in your extensions so as you can see

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.890 
in your extensions so as you can see
it's<00:05:34.760> starting<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:35.090> fold<00:05:35.300> a<00:05:35.419> little<00:05:35.630> bit

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
it's starting to fold a little bit

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.360 
it's starting to fold a little bit
better<00:05:36.050> into<00:05:36.349> my<00:05:36.470> extensions<00:05:36.979> but<00:05:37.099> I'm<00:05:37.190> not

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
better into my extensions but I'm not

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.189 
better into my extensions but I'm not
still<00:05:37.699> not<00:05:37.729> completely<00:05:38.300> happy<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.870> I<00:05:38.900> still

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
still not completely happy so I still

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.020 
still not completely happy so I still
got<00:05:39.349> a<00:05:39.409> curl<00:05:40.310> more<00:05:40.580> pieces<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.570> just<00:05:42.470> so<00:05:42.680> it

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
got a curl more pieces and just so it

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.629 
got a curl more pieces and just so it
pops<00:05:44.030> up<00:05:44.360> a<00:05:44.479> little<00:05:44.659> bit<00:05:44.840> more<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.530> see<00:05:46.490> how

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
pops up a little bit more so it see how

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.760 
pops up a little bit more so it see how
you<00:05:46.699> can<00:05:46.880> still<00:05:47.060> tell<00:05:47.360> my<00:05:47.599> top<00:05:47.870> layer<00:05:48.139> and<00:05:48.560> it's

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
you can still tell my top layer and it's

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.490 
you can still tell my top layer and it's
all<00:05:48.889> kind<00:05:49.099> of<00:05:49.190> folding<00:05:49.699> one<00:05:50.060> way<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:51.199> kind<00:05:51.470> of

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
all kind of folding one way you kind of

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.249 
all kind of folding one way you kind of
want<00:05:51.650> to<00:05:51.710> avoid<00:05:51.860> that<00:05:52.190> you<00:05:52.250> want<00:05:52.460> them<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.759> fold

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
want to avoid that you want them to fold

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.469 
want to avoid that you want them to fold
different<00:05:54.259> ways<00:05:54.440> your<00:05:54.880> natural<00:05:55.880> hair<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.300> it

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
different ways your natural hair so it

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.279 
different ways your natural hair so it
kind<00:05:57.259> of<00:05:57.320> blends<00:05:57.860> into<00:05:58.039> the<00:05:58.280> extensions<00:05:59.289> so

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
kind of blends into the extensions so

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.409 
kind of blends into the extensions so
what<00:06:00.650> I'm<00:06:00.740> doing<00:06:01.070> is<00:06:01.220> again<00:06:01.550> I'm<00:06:01.729> just<00:06:01.880> taking

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
what I'm doing is again I'm just taking

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.020 
what I'm doing is again I'm just taking
the<00:06:02.960> extension<00:06:03.530> pieces<00:06:03.800> and<00:06:04.220> curling<00:06:04.880> it

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
the extension pieces and curling it

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.899 
the extension pieces and curling it
around<00:06:05.509> the<00:06:05.750> barrel<00:06:06.110> so<00:06:06.380> that<00:06:06.650> way<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.280> actual

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
around the barrel so that way the actual

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.990 
around the barrel so that way the actual
my<00:06:08.300> natural<00:06:08.870> hair<00:06:09.440> will<00:06:10.070> just<00:06:10.310> fold<00:06:10.580> right

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
my natural hair will just fold right

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.510 
my natural hair will just fold right
into<00:06:11.449> the<00:06:11.570> extension<00:06:12.229> so<00:06:12.500> as<00:06:12.949> you<00:06:13.220> can<00:06:13.340> see

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
into the extension so as you can see

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.159 
into the extension so as you can see
it's<00:06:13.699> working<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.419> little<00:06:14.630> bit<00:06:14.750> better<00:06:14.900> it

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
it's working a little bit better it

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.790 
it's working a little bit better it
looks<00:06:15.560> a<00:06:15.710> lot<00:06:15.919> more<00:06:16.190> natural<00:06:16.970> looking<00:06:17.710> but<00:06:18.710> I'm

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
looks a lot more natural looking but I'm

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.050 
looks a lot more natural looking but I'm
still<00:06:19.070> not<00:06:19.220> finished<00:06:19.430> yet<00:06:19.669> I'm<00:06:19.820> going<00:06:20.000> to

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
still not finished yet I'm going to

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.560 
still not finished yet I'm going to
tweak<00:06:20.300> a<00:06:20.419> lot<00:06:20.599> more<00:06:21.610> just<00:06:22.610> go<00:06:22.970> through<00:06:23.180> pieces

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
tweak a lot more just go through pieces

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.899 
tweak a lot more just go through pieces
and<00:06:23.720> if<00:06:23.780> pieces<00:06:24.320> are<00:06:24.590> more<00:06:24.800> noticeable<00:06:25.250> just

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
and if pieces are more noticeable just

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.350 
and if pieces are more noticeable just
go<00:06:26.060> to<00:06:26.120> the<00:06:26.300> pieces<00:06:26.659> underneath<00:06:27.110> and<00:06:28.360> curl

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
go to the pieces underneath and curl

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.800 
go to the pieces underneath and curl
those<00:06:29.539> pieces<00:06:30.050> and<00:06:30.370> right<00:06:31.370> now<00:06:31.490> I'm<00:06:31.610> actually

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
those pieces and right now I'm actually

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.870 
those pieces and right now I'm actually
curling<00:06:32.810> the<00:06:32.930> piece<00:06:33.139> as<00:06:33.320> along<00:06:34.130> with<00:06:34.520> the

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
curling the piece as along with the

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.029 
curling the piece as along with the
actual<00:06:35.450> curl<00:06:35.779> itself<00:06:36.200> to<00:06:36.349> kind<00:06:36.529> of<00:06:36.590> blend<00:06:36.889> it

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
actual curl itself to kind of blend it

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.880 
actual curl itself to kind of blend it
together

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:38.890 
together

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.200 
together
so<00:06:39.890> now<00:06:40.010> that<00:06:40.070> I<00:06:40.220> have<00:06:40.460> it<00:06:40.610> as<00:06:40.760> seamless<00:06:41.030> as

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
so now that I have it as seamless as

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.600 
so now that I have it as seamless as
possible<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:42.170> tips<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.650> my<00:06:42.890> natural<00:06:43.040> hair<00:06:43.430> are

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
possible the tips of my natural hair are

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.240 
possible the tips of my natural hair are
blending<00:06:44.570> pretty<00:06:44.810> much<00:06:45.020> into<00:06:45.530> the<00:06:45.710> extension

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
blending pretty much into the extension

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.850 
blending pretty much into the extension
hair<00:06:46.430> I<00:06:46.610> want<00:06:47.240> to<00:06:47.540> give<00:06:47.840> the<00:06:48.050> top<00:06:48.290> of<00:06:48.470> my<00:06:48.590> head

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
hair I want to give the top of my head

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.520 
hair I want to give the top of my head
where<00:06:49.190> it's<00:06:49.370> more<00:06:49.610> flat<00:06:50.000> more<00:06:50.390> dimension<00:06:51.050> so

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
where it's more flat more dimension so

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.170 
where it's more flat more dimension so
at<00:06:51.890> this<00:06:52.040> point<00:06:52.250> I'm<00:06:52.430> going<00:06:52.580> to<00:06:52.760> be<00:06:52.910> wrapping

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
at this point I'm going to be wrapping

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.100 
at this point I'm going to be wrapping
the<00:06:53.570> curling<00:06:53.900> iron<00:06:54.080> around<00:06:54.770> the<00:06:55.540> the<00:06:56.540> hair<00:06:56.810> and

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
the curling iron around the the hair and

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.110 
the curling iron around the the hair and
I<00:06:57.260> know<00:06:57.320> I<00:06:57.440> suggested<00:06:58.160> not<00:06:58.310> to<00:06:58.520> do<00:06:58.640> this<00:06:58.820> but

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
I know I suggested not to do this but

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.110 
I know I suggested not to do this but
because<00:06:59.570> I<00:06:59.900> already<00:07:00.440> blended<00:07:00.860> the<00:07:01.400> ends<00:07:01.970> of

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
because I already blended the ends of

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.660 
because I already blended the ends of
the<00:07:02.360> hair<00:07:02.390> into<00:07:03.230> the<00:07:03.380> extensions<00:07:03.920> it<00:07:04.160> actually

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
the hair into the extensions it actually

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.350 
the hair into the extensions it actually
has<00:07:05.090> like<00:07:05.270> a<00:07:05.330> curl<00:07:05.690> to<00:07:05.900> it<00:07:06.760> whereas<00:07:07.760> when<00:07:08.240> you

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
has like a curl to it whereas when you

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.090 
has like a curl to it whereas when you
normally<00:07:09.020> just<00:07:09.230> curl<00:07:09.530> your<00:07:09.560> hair<00:07:09.890> like<00:07:10.070> this

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
normally just curl your hair like this

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.440 
normally just curl your hair like this
or<00:07:10.430> you<00:07:10.550> wrap<00:07:10.760> your<00:07:10.940> hair<00:07:11.090> around<00:07:11.120> the<00:07:11.390> curling

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
or you wrap your hair around the curling

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.230 
or you wrap your hair around the curling
iron<00:07:11.900> it<00:07:12.200> tends<00:07:12.530> to<00:07:12.800> leave<00:07:13.070> the<00:07:13.730> ends<00:07:14.120> of<00:07:14.210> your

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
iron it tends to leave the ends of your

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.020 
iron it tends to leave the ends of your
hair<00:07:14.360> pretty<00:07:14.840> straight<00:07:15.320> and<00:07:15.680> that's<00:07:16.580> what<00:07:16.910> we

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.640

don't<00:07:17.270> want<00:07:17.690> when<00:07:17.930> we're<00:07:18.170> trying<00:07:18.410> to<00:07:18.560> blend

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
don't want when we're trying to blend

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.740 
don't want when we're trying to blend
short<00:07:19.040> hair<00:07:19.220> into<00:07:19.490> the<00:07:19.640> extensions<00:07:20.180> we<00:07:20.540> want
