00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
easy this is and I still am very

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.320 
easy this is and I still am very
surprised<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.130> guess<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.640> right<00:03:20.670> word<00:03:20.820> that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
surprised I guess is the right word that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.120 
surprised I guess is the right word that
this<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.140> simple<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.450> easy<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
this is this simple and easy to do so

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.040 
this is this simple and easy to do so
one<00:03:26.880> extra<00:03:27.239> thing<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.630> when<00:03:27.930> you're

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
one extra thing is when you're

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.040 
one extra thing is when you're
downloading<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.709> map<00:03:28.940> from<00:03:29.940> your<00:03:30.120> browser<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
downloading the map from your browser it

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.470 
downloading the map from your browser it
will<00:03:31.140> often<00:03:31.560> tell<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.300> a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480

will often tell you that there is a
virus<00:03:34.140> in<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.530> file<00:03:34.709> you're<00:03:34.860> downloading

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
virus in the file you're downloading

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.460 
virus in the file you're downloading
you're<00:03:36.660> gonna<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.550> put<00:03:38.550> some<00:03:38.730> faith<00:03:38.970> in

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
you're gonna have to put some faith in

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.810 
you're gonna have to put some faith in
the<00:03:40.470> file<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.980> you're<00:03:41.220> gonna<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.580> ignore

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
the file and you're gonna have to ignore

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.370 
the file and you're gonna have to ignore
those<00:03:42.060> warnings<00:03:42.420> because<00:03:42.720> most<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.110> time

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
those warnings because most the time

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.930 
those warnings because most the time
it's<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.790> map

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.830
