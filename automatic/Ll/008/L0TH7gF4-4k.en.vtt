the preview capture off because i think

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.580 
the preview capture off because i think
it<00:03:28.620> lags<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:29.070> up<00:03:29.190> maybe<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:30.019> little<00:03:31.019> bit<00:03:31.290> i'm<00:03:31.470> not

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it lags it up maybe a little bit i'm not

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.530 
it lags it up maybe a little bit i'm not
sure<00:03:31.799> maybe<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> quality<00:03:32.760> gets<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.120> little

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
sure maybe the quality gets a little

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.560 
sure maybe the quality gets a little
