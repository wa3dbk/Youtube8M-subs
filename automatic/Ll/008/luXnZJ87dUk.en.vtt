well<00:00:31.779> as<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.100> extension<00:00:33.100> it's<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.460> very<00:00:33.670> nice

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
well as a extension it's a very nice

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.160

commercial bar setting type of

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
commercial bar setting type of
atmosphere<00:00:40.270> so<00:00:41.020> reception<00:00:41.590> desk<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.840> got<00:00:44.079> a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
atmosphere so reception desk it's got a

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.310 
atmosphere so reception desk it's got a
very<00:00:44.410> very<00:00:45.090> contemporary<00:00:46.090> look<00:00:46.510> to<00:00:46.539> it<00:00:46.870> we

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
very very contemporary look to it we

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.479 
very very contemporary look to it we
have<00:00:47.350> laid<00:00:47.769> out<00:00:47.980> our<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:49.690> substructure<00:00:50.589> for

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
have laid out our our substructure for

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.989 
have laid out our our substructure for
for<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.570> installation<00:00:53.350> now<00:00:54.219> on<00:00:54.519> this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
for this installation now on this

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.090 
for this installation now on this
installation<00:00:55.359> a<00:00:55.929> couple<00:00:56.589> of<00:00:56.649> things<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:56.980> keep

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
installation a couple of things to keep

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.720 
installation a couple of things to keep
in<00:00:57.309> mind

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
in mind

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.020 
in mind
so<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.269> cosmos<00:00:58.839> has<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.109> whole<00:00:59.559> pattern<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
so the cosmos has a whole pattern that

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.780 
so the cosmos has a whole pattern that
is<00:01:01.239> wider<00:01:01.629> than<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.530> standard<00:01:04.440> 2x4<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.729> you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
is wider than a standard 2x4 and so you

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.300 
is wider than a standard 2x4 and so you
can't<00:01:07.120> just<00:01:07.300> do<00:01:07.450> a<00:01:07.479> standard<00:01:08.020> stud<00:01:08.650> wall<00:01:08.950> mount

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
can't just do a standard stud wall mount

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.370 
can't just do a standard stud wall mount
here<00:01:09.640> there's<00:01:10.030> blocking<00:01:10.570> behind<00:01:10.990> our<00:01:11.140> board

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
here there's blocking behind our board

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.350 
here there's blocking behind our board
here<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.920> then<00:01:12.280> we<00:01:12.400> used<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.729> large<00:01:12.940> backer

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
here and then we used a large backer

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.360 
here and then we used a large backer
board<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.530> that's<00:01:14.710> what<00:01:14.830> we're<00:01:14.920> gonna<00:01:15.040> tie

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
board so that's what we're gonna tie

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.039 
board so that's what we're gonna tie
into<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.180> want<00:01:16.360> to<00:01:16.420> make<00:01:16.540> sure<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.840> your

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
into and you want to make sure that your

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.110 
into and you want to make sure that your
substructure<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.860> nice<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.310> sturdy<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.030> of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
substructure is nice and sturdy and of

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.060 
substructure is nice and sturdy and of
course<00:01:19.660> dealing<00:01:19.930> with<00:01:20.290> an<00:01:20.440> instructional

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
course dealing with an instructional

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.010 
course dealing with an instructional
counter<00:01:21.460> here<00:01:21.700> but<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.240> went<00:01:22.450> from<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.750> center

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
counter here but I went from the center

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.580 
counter here but I went from the center
point<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.560> counter<00:01:23.950> measured<00:01:24.730> out<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:26.020> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
point of the counter measured out to to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
point of the counter measured out to to
get<00:01:26.770> my<00:01:26.890> distances<00:01:27.610> between<00:01:27.850> my<00:01:28.420> my<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:30.040> cosmos

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
get my distances between my my my cosmos

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.330 
get my distances between my my my cosmos
so<00:01:31.420> we<00:01:31.540> laid<00:01:31.720> out<00:01:31.870> our<00:01:32.080> our<00:01:32.560> substructure

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
so we laid out our our substructure

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.090 
so we laid out our our substructure
we've<00:01:33.880> marked<00:01:34.210> our<00:01:34.390> locations<00:01:35.050> once<00:01:35.890> you've

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
we've marked our locations once you've

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.680 
we've marked our locations once you've
done<00:01:36.340> all<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.670> setup<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.390> particular

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
done all the setup on this particular

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.510 
done all the setup on this particular
installation<00:01:38.230> it<00:01:38.650> actually<00:01:38.980> moves<00:01:39.220> pretty

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
installation it actually moves pretty

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.200 
installation it actually moves pretty
fast<00:01:39.640> from<00:01:40.210> from<00:01:40.690> from<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.350> point<00:01:41.620> so<00:01:42.490> since

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
fast from from from that point so since

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.570 
fast from from from that point so since
I've<00:01:43.360> already<00:01:43.480> laid<00:01:43.810> out<00:01:43.870> my<00:01:44.230> my<00:01:44.890> location<00:01:45.280> I'm

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
I've already laid out my my location I'm

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.730 
I've already laid out my my location I'm
gonna<00:01:45.730> Center<00:01:46.030> my<00:01:46.300> I'm<00:01:47.020> gonna<00:01:47.170> Center<00:01:47.440> my<00:01:47.680> my

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
gonna Center my I'm gonna Center my my

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.430 
gonna Center my I'm gonna Center my my
like<00:01:50.740> my<00:01:51.490> plate<00:01:51.820> here<00:01:52.270> I'm<00:01:52.780> gonna<00:01:52.960> Center<00:01:53.200> that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
like my plate here I'm gonna Center that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.950 
like my plate here I'm gonna Center that
on<00:01:53.590> my<00:01:53.710> line<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.520> I've<00:01:54.820> pre<00:01:55.150> measured<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.780> so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
on my line and I've pre measured this so

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.510 
on my line and I've pre measured this so
I<00:01:55.990> know<00:01:56.140> what<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.590> distance<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.190> is<00:01:57.430> supposed

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
I know what the distance is is supposed

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.550 
I know what the distance is is supposed
to<00:01:57.760> be<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:58.900> I'm<00:01:58.990> gonna<00:01:59.140> make<00:01:59.350> sure<00:01:59.380> that

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
to be and so I'm gonna make sure that

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.800 
to be and so I'm gonna make sure that
I'm<00:01:59.860> hitting<00:02:00.070> on<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:01.000> just<00:02:01.390> need<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.690> move

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
I'm hitting on that I just need to move

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
I'm hitting on that I just need to move
it<00:02:01.930> over<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.260> slightly<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.450> direction

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.610 

that<00:02:09.789> should<00:02:10.090> do<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.140> now<00:02:11.760> I've<00:02:12.760> got<00:02:13.090> my

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that should do it so now I've got my

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.800 
that should do it so now I've got my
location<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:14.950> my<00:02:15.990> my<00:02:16.990> sub<00:02:17.260> plate<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:19.600> gonna

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
location on my my sub plate I'm gonna

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.670 
location on my my sub plate I'm gonna
take<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.050> pencil<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:22.020> want<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> use<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> drill<00:02:23.530> bit
