00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.759
 ugh 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.020
 welcome to the mountains of morocco us 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.700
 test today like the porsche 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.170
 in our case the turbo so that 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.070
 top model that means we talk about 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.660
 400 ps 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.320
 Now he wants to look what's up 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.000
 the road and off the piste can 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.699
 wide and flat and had only 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.090
 meter 62 in height almost a little 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.559
 crouched is the makana in the street 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.590
 like a tiger lurking on the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.360
 ultimate jump and the comparison 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 probably not back then nothing else 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.339
 hides behind in Indonesian 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.140
 the term makam the Zuffenhausen 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.930
 have the role of the little cayenne 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 brother clearly defines he is not 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.610
 less than the sports car among the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.199
 compact suvs 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.619
 but everything was on the way for him 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.659
 given what a real porsche needs 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.580
 from the very high quality machart to 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.030
 towards the seemingly endless 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.100
 driving dynamics plentiful and comfortable 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.100
 is the space itself for large 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.400
 Passengers and that is not at all 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.640
 to load the luggage space because with 500 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.800
 or 1500 liters is enough storage space 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.170
 ready to go on a mountain bike tour 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.420
 or even a luggage holiday 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.340
 to compete 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.290
 it is almost unnecessary to point this out 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.360
 that the design and equipment of the 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.970
 youngest offspring of the porsche family 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.340
 above all doubt is too 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.530
 high quality comfortable and technical 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.130
 upgraded, it is strikingly as 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.799
 the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.009
 could be in Merkel of home from 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.329
 For example, in makan are installed 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.979
 four-wheel drive double - clutch transmission 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.229
 multifunction sport steering wheel with 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.500
 shift paddles big wheels or one 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.360
 electric tailgate 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.210
 the technical basis of the new porsche 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.740
 like one of the audi q5 around the vehicle 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.569
 still the typical Porsche 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.490
 properties mitzugeben you by 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.840
 porsche and two-thirds of the vehicle 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.940
 either completely redeveloped or 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.290
 but massively revised and that must 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.739
 You say you really feel in each one 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.780
 Driving situation so he lets suspect 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.569
 Do not take long to catch the tiger 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.730
 wait because after the first occurs 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.480
 his cup needs only 48 seconds 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.030
 up to 100 speed absolutely impressive 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.880
 is the precise steerability of the four 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.830
 meter seventy long makam it makes the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.840
 impression as if he could read thoughts 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.030
 and before you even get the steering wheel 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.160
 Moving know that one immediately turns 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.209
 attacking 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.310
 through the clean and good 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.590
 controllable track were behaving 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.660
 the everlasting serpentines in the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.480
 Put Morocco into a real fun 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.769
 tour the porsche likes one thing 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.180
 suitable for everyday use that means you can do that 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.910
 Car really nice cozy colors 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.350
 nevertheless porsche is space enough typical 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.690
 then also very sporty when traveling 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.280
 you want it because its a bit nervous 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.720
 I think at the back but that makes 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.590
 Somehow the whole car is out 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.090
 a little bit crisper 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.330
 which is funny for you yesterday 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.739
 so well on the way and there you have 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.599
 noted that the car two times up 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.160
 the lofoten or things are really important 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.269
 put away you get from I vehicles 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.040
 expect that we are despite 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.910
 potholes despite gravel you 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.180
 actually still very comfortable 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.830
 is driven on the way 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 marks with his three sporty ones 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.879
 Chassis variants of three charged 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.769
 six cylinder engines combined with 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.660
 a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.629
 and the Porsche traction management 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.090
 this ensures efficiency and efficiency 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.849
 lots of driving fun 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.250
 the 3.6-liter v6 biturbo will come along 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.579
 400 ps and marks it with three liters 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.530
 v6 and 340 ps set the bar in theirs 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:52.440
 segment new on the diesel with 258 hp 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.230
 and 580 newton meters is the torque 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.269
 strongest in his ranks those of 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.250
 porsche-indicated consumption values ​​of 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.799
 We have about six to nine liters 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.690
 however misses our turbo 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.510
 always approved more than 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.250
 but we were twelve liters too 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.239
 almost exclusively in the mountains 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.650
 on the way and that again quite fast 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.630
 That was our father's with the new one 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.039
 porsche makers here in morocco ours 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.239
 way leads us through beautiful 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.620
 landscapes i have to say quite honestly 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.570
 if I should decide now 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.370
 What I liked more about the vehicle 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.200
 or the track I'm not quite 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.680
 but certainly as autonomous I would probably 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.680
 wants the car
