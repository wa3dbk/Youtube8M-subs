of little itty bitty dinky weapons there
I<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.240> Jamal<00:01:06.510> Charles<00:01:06.720> has<00:01:06.960> taken

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
I don't think Jamal Charles has taken

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.109 
I don't think Jamal Charles has taken
anybody<00:01:07.530> by<00:01:07.680> surprise<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.189> think<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> Raiders

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
anybody by surprise I think the Raiders

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.670 
anybody by surprise I think the Raiders
defense<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:10.020> bit<00:01:10.140> better<00:01:10.260> than<00:01:10.530> they

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
defense is a little bit better than they

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560 
defense is a little bit better than they
were<00:01:10.740> last<00:01:10.890> year<00:01:11.549> playing<00:01:12.090> against<00:01:12.479> them

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
were last year playing against them

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
were last year playing against them
twice<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.930> i<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.409> defense's<00:01:13.950> in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
twice here i think the defense's in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.710 
twice here i think the defense's in
Denver<00:01:14.549> also<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.479> better<00:01:15.570> than

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
Denver also was a little bit better than

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.330 
Denver also was a little bit better than
they<00:01:15.840> were<00:01:15.869> last<00:01:16.020> year<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.860> think<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.250> his

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
they were last year so I think that his

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
they were last year so I think that his
comp<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.909> division<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.990> gotten<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> little

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
comp is division has gotten a little

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
comp is division has gotten a little
tougher<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> defensive<00:01:20.640> side<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
tougher on the defensive side of the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
tougher on the defensive side of the
ball<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.990> think<00:01:22.229> he's<00:01:22.380> gonna<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
ball and I think he's gonna be like I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
ball and I think he's gonna be like I
said<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.790> horrible<00:01:24.360> fall<00:01:24.630> off<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> face<00:01:25.080> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
said not horrible fall off the face of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
said not horrible fall off the face of
the<00:01:25.320> earth<00:01:25.350> guy<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.939> whoever<00:01:27.150> drafts

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the earth guy but I see whoever drafts

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.850 
the earth guy but I see whoever drafts
him<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.200> upset<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.619> they

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
him is going to be upset that they
