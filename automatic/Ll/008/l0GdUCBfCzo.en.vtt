this song is played in the key of C
sharp<00:00:09.000> made<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> minor<00:00:10.019> which<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> same

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
sharp made a minor which is the same

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.640 
sharp made a minor which is the same
with<00:00:11.190> E<00:00:11.370> major<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.719> it's<00:00:12.840> good<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
with E major so it's good to be for a

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.849 
with E major so it's good to be for a
while<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.280> attendance<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.540> use<00:00:15.719> e<00:00:15.960> F

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
while and see the attendance we use e F

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.500 
while and see the attendance we use e F
sharp<00:00:16.920> G<00:00:17.699> sharp<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.600> B<00:00:20.060> C<00:00:21.060> sharp<00:00:21.090> d<00:00:21.990> sharp<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.410> E

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
sharp G sharp a B C sharp d sharp and E

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:32.240 
sharp G sharp a B C sharp d sharp and E
the<00:00:24.510> same<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.930> C<00:00:25.140> sharp<00:00:25.410> minor<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> let's<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the same in C sharp minor so let's go to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.330 
the same in C sharp minor so let's go to
the<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> verse<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> then<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:35.070> will

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the to the to the verse and then we will

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.380 
the to the to the verse and then we will
see<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.120> course<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> verse

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
see little bit of course so the verse

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
see little bit of course so the verse
then<00:00:39.390> they<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.629> similar<00:00:39.899> love<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
then they are similar love so for the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:01:00.260 
then they are similar love so for the
verse<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.090> try<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> beginning

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 

so<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.900> can<00:01:01.080> try<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.380> as<00:01:01.740> the<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so we can try this as the first the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.250 
so we can try this as the first the
first<00:01:02.730> part<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.330> verse<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.990> let's<00:01:04.170> see

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
first part of the verse so let's see

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.970 
first part of the verse so let's see
what's<00:01:04.440> going<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:05.240> we<00:01:06.240> take<00:01:06.480> the<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:07.530> core<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
what's going on we take the the core a

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.250 
what's going on we take the the core a
major<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:10.290> idea<00:01:10.620> is<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.130> start<00:01:12.260> pressing

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
major so the idea is to start pressing

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260 
major so the idea is to start pressing
both<00:01:13.680> hands<00:01:13.920> now<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.370> Left<00:01:14.550> we<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.790> start

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
both hands now on the Left we can start

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
both hands now on the Left we can start
with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.480> base<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.140> use<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> base<00:01:17.550> on<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
with the base we can use the base on the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270 
with the base we can use the base on the
right<00:01:18.060> hand<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.540> use<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.110> key<00:01:19.320> Caesar<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
right hand we use this to key Caesar and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.140 
right hand we use this to key Caesar and
Jeter<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.900> let's<00:01:22.140> start<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.890> base<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.970> right

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
Jeter so let's start the base the right

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.300 
Jeter so let's start the base the right
hand<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.840> same<00:01:25.110> time<00:01:25.460> 1<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.210> 2<00:01:27.690> 3<00:01:28.050> 1<00:01:29.010> 2

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
hand at the same time 1 and then 2 3 1 2

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.060 
hand at the same time 1 and then 2 3 1 2
3<00:01:29.460> 2<00:01:30.090> 3<00:01:30.300> e<00:01:30.750> &amp;<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> left<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.330> 1<00:01:33.690> 2<00:01:34.229> 3<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> we

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
3 2 3 e &amp; a on the left so 1 2 3 then we

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.850 
3 2 3 e &amp; a on the left so 1 2 3 then we
go<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> next<00:01:38.550> chord<00:01:39.440> which<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.590> being

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
go to the next chord which is being

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.750 
go to the next chord which is being
major<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.940> base<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.479> B<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.080> hand<00:01:43.440> is<00:01:44.340> d

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
major the base is B the right hand is d

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.690 
major the base is B the right hand is d
sharp<00:01:44.790> F<00:01:45.390> sharp<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.070> start<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.550> base

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
sharp F sharp so we start with the base

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.910 
sharp F sharp so we start with the base
of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> right<00:01:48.060> hand<00:01:48.330> we'll<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.260> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of the right hand we'll do this one and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.940 
of the right hand we'll do this one and
then<00:01:49.979> 2<00:01:50.250> 3<00:01:50.430> F<00:01:51.150> sharp<00:01:51.510> B<00:01:52.700> 1<00:01:53.700> 2<00:01:54.090> 3<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:55.410> first<00:01:55.680> chord

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
then 2 3 F sharp B 1 2 3 so first chord

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.210 
then 2 3 F sharp B 1 2 3 so first chord
is<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.330> 1<00:01:57.330> 2<00:01:57.540> 3<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.170> beat<00:01:58.410> 1<00:01:58.770> 2<00:01:59.130> 3<00:01:59.750> 1<00:02:00.750> 2<00:02:00.780> 3<00:02:01.140> 1<00:02:01.560> 2

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
is a 1 2 3 and the beat 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.400 
is a 1 2 3 and the beat 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2
3

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.400 

now<00:02:09.410> we're<00:02:09.560> good<00:02:09.679> Susur

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.430 

so<00:02:14.410> 1<00:02:15.250> 2<00:02:15.760> 3<00:02:15.790> 1<00:02:16.600> 1<00:02:17.230> 2<00:02:17.290> 3<00:02:17.590> 4<00:02:18.220> 5<00:02:18.520> 6<00:02:18.820> 7<00:02:19.300> 8<00:02:19.420> 9<00:02:19.780> 10<00:02:20.110> busy

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 busy

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.710 
so 1 2 3 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 busy
idea<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> 1<00:02:21.700> 2<00:02:21.820> 3<00:02:21.940> is<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.120> same<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.570> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
idea so the 1 2 3 is the same like the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.420 
idea so the 1 2 3 is the same like the
previous<00:02:23.020> court<00:02:23.410> we'll<00:02:23.860> start<00:02:24.070> with<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> basic

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
previous court we'll start with a basic

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.790 
previous court we'll start with a basic
Caesar<00:02:25.060> right<00:02:25.660> hands<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.110> same<00:02:26.320> these<00:02:26.650> are

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
Caesar right hands the same these are

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.270 
Caesar right hands the same these are
better

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
better

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.860 
better
so<00:02:27.850> better<00:02:28.120> right<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.690> 1<00:02:29.050> &amp;<00:02:29.470> 2<00:02:30.300> 3G<00:02:31.300> services

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
so better right now is 1 &amp; 2 3G services

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.310 
so better right now is 1 &amp; 2 3G services
are<00:02:32.080> 1<00:02:32.710> 2<00:02:33.070> 3<00:02:33.370> then<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.120> move<00:02:34.300> forward<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.990> this

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
are 1 2 3 then we move forward like this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.390 

so<00:03:28.880> let's<00:03:29.090> play<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.510> three<00:03:29.780> three<00:03:30.530> course<00:03:30.800> one

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
so let's play the three three course one

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.330 
so let's play the three three course one
attempt<00:03:31.760> from<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.030> beginning

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.470 

so<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.440> rotisserie<00:03:40.440> B<00:03:40.980> 1<00:03:41.280> 2<00:03:41.700> 3<00:03:41.760> 1<00:03:42.569> 2<00:03:42.599> 3<00:03:42.989> 4<00:03:43.860> 5<00:03:44.280> 6<00:03:44.670> 7<00:03:45.060> 8

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
so a rotisserie B 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.200 
so a rotisserie B 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.240 

so<00:03:53.210> this<00:03:54.050> is<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.440> now<00:03:54.710> we<00:03:54.770> keep<00:03:55.040> repeating

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
so this is it now we keep repeating

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.520 
so this is it now we keep repeating
these<00:03:55.790> at<00:03:56.240> least<00:03:56.510> four<00:03:56.690> times<00:03:56.960> and<00:03:57.200> then<00:03:57.290> four

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
these at least four times and then four

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:08.300 
these at least four times and then four
more

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.990 

little<00:04:08.700> faster<00:04:08.910> I<00:04:09.090> think

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.430 

keep<00:04:16.000> repeating<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.539> part<00:04:16.840> for<00:04:16.989> as<00:04:17.079> long<00:04:17.229> as

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
keep repeating this part for as long as

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.140 
keep repeating this part for as long as
necessary<00:04:17.739> and<00:04:18.250> then

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.210 

then<00:04:24.150> after<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.290> beat<00:04:25.590> these<00:04:25.710> four<00:04:25.950> elements

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
then after we beat these four elements

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.760 
then after we beat these four elements
necessary<00:04:26.610> we<00:04:27.030> go<00:04:27.270> to<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> next<00:04:27.810> chord<00:04:28.170> or<00:04:28.620> to

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
necessary we go to the next chord or to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:40.960 
necessary we go to the next chord or to
the<00:04:28.860> second<00:04:29.160> part<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.610> verse<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:30.570> is

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.210 

absurd<00:04:41.970> minor<00:04:42.240> we<00:04:42.510> start<00:04:42.780> with<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.590> base

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
absurd minor we start with the base

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.580 
absurd minor we start with the base
we<00:04:44.730> also<00:04:45.000> press<00:04:45.540> at<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.810> same<00:04:46.020> time<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.410> right

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
we also press at the same time the right

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.150 
we also press at the same time the right
hand<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.280> see<00:04:48.120> some<00:04:48.360> bases<00:04:48.900> f-sharp<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:50.130> a

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
hand with a see some bases f-sharp so a

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.990 
hand with a see some bases f-sharp so a
suppressed<00:04:50.700> basin<00:04:51.270> right<00:04:52.010> so<00:04:53.010> after<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.760> we

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
suppressed basin right so after that we

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.550 
suppressed basin right so after that we
move<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.420> right<00:04:54.570> hand<00:04:54.630> up<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:54.990> down<00:04:55.110> with

now the G sharp and the basic G

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.570 
now the G sharp and the basic G
separately<00:05:37.940> we<00:05:38.060> can<00:05:38.240> start<00:05:38.630> with<00:05:39.440> maybe<00:05:40.250> just

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
separately we can start with maybe just

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.790 
separately we can start with maybe just
G<00:05:41.180> self<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:42.440> Caesar<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.720> base<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.350> right<00:05:45.500> hand

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
G self and Caesar so base and right hand

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.370 
G self and Caesar so base and right hand
one<00:05:46.540> two<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.660> same<00:05:47.840> thing<00:05:47.990> on<00:05:48.110> the<00:05:48.200> right<00:05:48.320> hand

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
one two the same thing on the right hand

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.980 
one two the same thing on the right hand
we<00:05:49.310> do<00:05:49.460> like<00:05:50.590> three<00:05:51.590> four<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.460> then<00:05:52.990> the

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
we do like three four and then the

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.760
