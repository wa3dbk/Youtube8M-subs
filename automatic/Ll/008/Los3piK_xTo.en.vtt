00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.450
 [Music] 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 now we take the envelope of curd and what 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.430
 let's dilute it in milk and with help 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.489
 of some manual rods we are going to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.110
 Mix so that it is well integrated 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.170
 Now let's put in a saucepan to boil 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.710
 cream plus chocolate 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.450
 [Music] 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.490
 when you see that chocolate is 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.890
 we're going to add the milk plus the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.360
 curd and stir until it arrives 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.109
 to the boiling point 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.170
 [Music] 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.149
 when it boils we remove it now let's 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.399
 put a saucer and over our mold 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.829
 this will help us transport it better 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.909
 so now we are going to dump our 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.729
 white chocolate 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.460
 we'll let it cool a little and what 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.299
 let's introduce in the fridge 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.429
 approximately for 30 minutes 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.180
 while we are preparing the next 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:52.400
 He passed 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.400
 [Music] 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 we have the milk the cream the sugar the 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.910
 chocolate and the curd so we separated 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.370
 these three ingredients and we're going to catch 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.890
 the envelope of curd and we will dilute them 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.900
 in the milk and with the help of some rods 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.500
 we are going to remove them so that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.220
 is well integrated 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 [Music] 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.560
 now let's put to warm up in a 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:22.349
 I scoop the cream the milk chocolate 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.610
 [Music] 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.040
 and the sugar and we're going to let it melt 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.870
 [Music] 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.030
 once the chocolate is melted 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.560
 to add the milk plus the curd and go 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.560
 to stir until it boils 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.239
 when we break bit we remove it from the fire 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.920
 with the help of a fork we grate a 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.280
 little chocolate surface 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.500
 white we take a ladle and carefully 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.069
 let's add the chocolate mix 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.069
 Milky 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.270
 and we do the same as with chocolate 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.430
 white we will let cool to 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.200
 room temperature a few minutes and 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.960
 then we will put it in the fridge 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.510
 for 30 minutes 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.950
 and finally we have milk cream 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.750
 black chocolate sugar and curd 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.250
 we observe a second and in these 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.379
 ingredients so now we take the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.569
 curd sachet and we will add it 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.940
 to the milk and with the help of some rods 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.530
 we are going to mix it so that 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.700
 is well integrated now we put 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.700
 heat the cream 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.760
 we also add the dark chocolate 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:53.260
 and the sugar once we see that the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.300
 chocolate has melted let's add 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.120
 the milk and the curd and we will remove 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.340
 until it reaches the boiling point 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.549
 and when it starts to boil we will remove it 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.980
 of the fire we return to scratch the surface 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.890
 we do this so that later the layers 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.840
 stick to each other now with help to 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.420
 through the ladle we will go overturning 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.419
 our black chocolate on the layer of 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.669
 milk chocolate with care now 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.160
 we 'll let it cool a few minutes 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.820
 and then we will put it in the fridge 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.580
 a minimum of 6 hours 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.590
 Now let's unmold it and let's 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.720
 need a bowl of warm water 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.950
 so we introduce our mold some 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.590
 seconds and we remove it we take them out 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.440
 of the water we put a little bit the bowl 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.510
 we put a little dish on top and with a lot 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.210
 be careful let's go around 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:50.080
 our cake careful in weighing 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.070
 and as a last step we removed the mold and 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.980
 voilÃ  and up to our letter 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.900
 now let's go for the decoration so 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.190
 we will need dark chocolate to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.190
 melt and a globe 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.640
 to begin with let's put to melt a 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.470
 little bit of chocolate and when we see that 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.470
 it's melted we remove it from the fire 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.700
 Now we take an inflated balloon and we 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.990
 to add a little chocolate for 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.510
 The top 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.180
 and carefully we are going to turn the 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:29.210
 balloon to give it the shape we want 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.470
 [Music] 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.420
 As you can see, I'm doing it with 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.610
 dark chocolate but here everyone 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.290
 You can do it the way you like it if you 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.080
 fancy combining white chocolate and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:51.490
 dark chocolate is also very nice 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:51.490
 [Music] 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.879
 [Music] 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.699
 when you have achieved the form 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.480
 we're going to let it cool 10 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.850
 Minutitos in the freezer 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.410
 [Music] 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.700
 now carefully but decisively 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.740
 let's remove the glass from our balloon 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.870
 we take a pair of scissors and make a 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:32.080
 small hole to let the air out 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:34.210
 very little by little and when I go out 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.220
 the air little by little you are helping 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.220
 from a small spatula to let go 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.640
 the chocolate once you have it you remove 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.440
 from around the globe and we have it ready 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.090
 Now, as you can see, I took some balls 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.400
 of three chocolates and I've put them 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.250
 around the cake and as a final touch 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.710
 let's put the balloon decoration 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.050
 chocolate we had prepared the 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.120
 fill with balls and we have 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.700
 our beautiful cake of three chocolates 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.380
 you will see how we can resist 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.930

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:08.260
