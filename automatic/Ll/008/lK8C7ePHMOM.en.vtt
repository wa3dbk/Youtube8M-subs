00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello I'm luca and in this video 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.560
 we'll talk about something slightly 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.569
 usually different than usual 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.250
 they are always advice and enough 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.960
 theorists then drop a good component 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.150
 of theory that I have collected over the years 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.799
 and studied today instead I will provide something 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.839
 slightly different then something 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.210
 more practical but still very much 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.580
 My advice is that effective 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.900
 certainly basic it is important to have 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.789
 always starting when you start 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 precisely from the card a card of a 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 qualified staff who can 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.680
 help you to be clear on 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 time when you phone gym 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.439
 obviously if the first weapons do not know how 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 so you never did Lenart 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.700
 surely it is important to have one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.680
 reference video card in terms of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 series of petitions exercises that though 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 even more important than this 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 I have already mentioned this concept in others 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 my videos is really the talk of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.870
 know over time your 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 body because each of us is different 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.890
 therefore, the same theory has then such 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 card you can have and two people 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.530
 different will have very often results 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 in my place it's still pretty 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.219
 different then always in the perspective of 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.199
 my training method that precisely the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.460
 butterfly method allows you to use 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.420
 little weight increase or your own 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 awareness what really 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 matters is the flow of time to know 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 better your body then as precisely 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.640
 in the past already mentioned is not so much 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 important 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 let 's say the number of petitions series 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 which are only means but what you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 really interested is listening to yours 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 body and understand how it reacts to individuals 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.869
 exercises because and it can happen very well 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.820
 that individual exercises are exactly like 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 if I have a different effectiveness before 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.509
 we say and listen to individuals and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.710
 especially even if these 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.180
 exercises should be in theory with i 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 more effective as an example punkara bench 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.530
 flat and shakes and above all inside 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 some groups of your own body 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.290
 muscles will react very well 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.060
 workout so you will have excellent 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.159
 results while others obviously 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.229
 will have will they say do more effort 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.180
 to grow and above all precisely 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.710
 the important thing is to understand which ones 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.600
 Muscles tend to have a little more 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 back and above all for each group 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.020
 muscle then legs and chest shoulders 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.119
 back and so on 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.970
 It is important to understand with the sian exercises 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.530
 really more effective and just boom 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.060
 muscle regardless of theory 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 so for example for the legs 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 in theory detachment and shakes should 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.310
 be the most effective pro maybe ad 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.049
 example you are very tall therefore having neither 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 very long legs can hardly buy it 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.590
 shakes way 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.539
 correct possible here and e 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.710
 at the same time it does not feel effective 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.630
 so in that case suggestion 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.040
 obviously and to listen to your body 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.450
 then leave the shakes to one side 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.150
 maybe go to the press then 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.470
 really very simple tips 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.970
 I would also say common sense but 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.770
 really very effective therefore useless 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.360
 follow a challenge that should be 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.740
 the theoretical one the perfect one the most 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.390
 effective if really then my body 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.920
 does not react in the most precise manner 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.500
 so I recommend it 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.850
 and if for example you have ever seen a 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.760
 some people were some others 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.830
 fitness trainer we say some athlete 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.970
 professional who trains 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.910
 practically never seen the birth one 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.730
 so we specify the card in detail 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.080
 what they do and rely heavily on 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.910
 speech of instinct then surely 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.709
 will have a year programming in 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.060
 terms of macro cicr and microchip and so 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.100
 however in fact when 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.750
 they will be there in the gym to train 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.550
 what will always prevail is instinct 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.810
 since over time they have 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.670
 learned about your own body e 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.870
 so they know exactly what the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.100
 own body needs to be able to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.989
 grow at its best so it really is 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.850
 important to listen to one's instinct 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.800
 so ok the ok speech card 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.959
 purely rational of numbers but also 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.430
 purely distinct speech and therefore if 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.709
 always an example that the bank is flat 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.400
 example may be enough to have a good one 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.470
 chest 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.390
 maybe it's the right way with useless 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.190
 do also crosses or extensions or alt 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.810
 exercises right because the card says 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.130
 that but if you really feel advice 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.620
 exercise two exercises not those 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.060
 really effective because it is muscular 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.140
 so really focus on those 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.880
 I recommend it 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.590
 I repeat that it is the discourse of the challenge but 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.850
 what is important also and always 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.920
 the talk of listening to pippo collo 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.810
 because the truth really lies in 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.670
 feel what really effective 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.920
 for ourselves then this is a 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.900
 I really recommend it very easy 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.070
 common sense as I always recommend 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.239
 to write my youtube channel if not 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.900
 you did it and follow me up too 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.900
 facebook hello
