00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I had the regular gimbal plastic

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.290 
I had the regular gimbal plastic
attachment<00:00:43.020> devices<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> place<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:45.090> they

sort of snapped off and bent and the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.619

gimbal<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.399> hanging<00:00:47.789> free<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:50.390> took<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> deep

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
gimbal was hanging free so I took a deep

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.060 
gimbal was hanging free so I took a deep
breath<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.230> sort<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> hooked<00:00:52.890> everything

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
breath and sort of hooked everything

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.450 
breath and sort of hooked everything
back<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.629> used<00:00:54.930> end<00:00:55.289> up<00:00:55.410> putting<00:00:55.590> zip

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
back up and I used end up putting zip

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.569 
back up and I used end up putting zip
ties<00:00:57.440> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> corners<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.550> my<00:01:01.340> gimbal<00:01:02.340> mount

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
remote control I'm using that to film

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.960 
remote control I'm using that to film
from<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> why<00:01:38.400> you're<00:01:38.579> seeing<00:01:38.759> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
from which is why you're seeing this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
from which is why you're seeing this
little<00:01:39.650> clip<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> picture<00:01:41.130> anyways<00:01:43.100> this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
little clip in the picture anyways this

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
little clip in the picture anyways this
was<00:01:44.159> good<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.939> side<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> side<00:01:45.810> motion<00:01:45.990> was

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
was good and side to side motion was

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.090 
was good and side to side motion was
good<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.579> smooth<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:49.680> motion

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
good this is very smooth but this motion

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.880 
good this is very smooth but this motion
here's<00:01:50.460> takes<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:52.110> effort<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
here's takes a much more effort and the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.469 
here's takes a much more effort and the
camera<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.340> getting<00:01:53.670> stuck<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.329> certain

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
camera was getting stuck in a certain

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.910 
camera was getting stuck in a certain
position<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.049> wouldn't<00:01:55.350> move<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
position and wouldn't move back when I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
position and wouldn't move back when I
was<00:01:56.070> flying<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> thought<00:01:57.960> I'd<00:01:58.140> bit

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
was flying it and so I thought I'd bit

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.520 
was flying it and so I thought I'd bit
my<00:01:58.530> arm<00:01:58.560> turns<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.090> had<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.020> straps<00:02:01.290> too

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
my arm turns out I had my straps too

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.270 
my arm turns out I had my straps too
tight<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> loosen<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.820> straps<00:02:03.360> up<00:02:03.780> here

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
tight if I loosen these straps up here

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.440 
tight if I loosen these straps up here
you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.700> could<00:02:05.820> tell<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.299> can

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
you know if you could tell if I can

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
you know if you could tell if I can
demonstrate<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.110> pull<00:02:07.350> down<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
demonstrate if I pull down here that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.119 
demonstrate if I pull down here that
frees<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> runs<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.289> right

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
frees it up and it runs just right

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.020 
frees it up and it runs just right
so<00:02:11.640> don't<00:02:12.060> strap<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.450> down<00:02:12.480> too<00:02:12.780> tight
