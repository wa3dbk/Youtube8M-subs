changing<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.670> mindset<00:01:53.939> when<00:01:54.210> you're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
changing your mindset when you're

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.550

be<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.450> careful<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.990> say<00:01:58.049> because

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560

what champions are we looking to play
against<00:03:59.519> these<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.000> that's<00:04:00.359> how<00:04:00.480> we<00:04:00.540> prepare

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
against these and that's how we prepare

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.659 
against these and that's how we prepare
for<00:04:01.169> games<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.190> worked<00:04:02.340> out<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.489> us

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
for games and it's worked out for us

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.250 
for games and it's worked out for us
pretty<00:04:02.849> well<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.329> would<00:04:03.540> say<00:04:03.690> right<00:04:04.079> at<00:04:04.200> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
pretty well I would say right at the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.720 
pretty well I would say right at the
start<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.590> season<00:04:04.769> crumbs<00:04:05.430> had<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.639> go

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
start of the season crumbs had to go

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.860 
start of the season crumbs had to go
back<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.060> jungle<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.450> you<00:04:06.510> guys<00:04:06.629> picked

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
back to the jungle and you guys picked

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.689 
back to the jungle and you guys picked
up<00:04:06.989> Kiwi<00:04:07.260> kid<00:04:07.470> how<00:04:07.980> do<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.129> think<00:04:08.280> Kiwi<00:04:08.549> kids

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
up Kiwi kid how do you think Kiwi kids

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.970 
up Kiwi kid how do you think Kiwi kids
adapted<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.569> fit<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.349> with<00:04:10.379> Dignitas<00:04:10.829> so

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
adapted and fit in with Dignitas so

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.520 
adapted and fit in with Dignitas so
quickly<00:04:11.280> he<00:04:11.790> meshes<00:04:12.120> very<00:04:12.329> well<00:04:12.540> with<00:04:12.840> most<00:04:13.349> of

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
quickly he meshes very well with most of

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.979 
quickly he meshes very well with most of
people<00:04:13.769> on<00:04:13.859> our<00:04:13.889> team<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.160> that's<00:04:14.699> why<00:04:15.510> he's

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
people on our team that that's why he's

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.330 
people on our team that that's why he's
fit<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:16.709> well<00:04:16.859> with<00:04:16.889> us

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
fit in so well with us

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.060 
fit in so well with us
I'd<00:04:17.789> say<00:04:18.000> communication<00:04:18.359> wise<00:04:18.799> he's<00:04:19.799> still

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
I'd say communication wise he's still

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.940 
I'd say communication wise he's still
getting<00:04:20.700> there<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.930> he<00:04:22.200> still<00:04:22.409> has<00:04:22.530> some<00:04:22.770> like

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
getting there and he still has some like

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.320 
getting there and he still has some like
rough<00:04:23.159> edges<00:04:23.310> around<00:04:23.760> but<00:04:23.940> for<00:04:23.969> the<00:04:24.150> most<00:04:24.240> part

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
rough edges around but for the most part

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.780 
rough edges around but for the most part
he's<00:04:24.539> performed<00:04:24.870> very<00:04:25.050> very<00:04:25.080> well

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
he's performed very very well

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.950 
he's performed very very well
so<00:04:25.910> there's<00:04:26.060> been<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.240> lot<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.390> roster<00:04:26.690> changes

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
so there's been a lot of roster changes

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.740 
so there's been a lot of roster changes
amongst<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.710> lower<00:04:27.950> teens<00:04:28.190> in<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.430> LCS

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
amongst the lower teens in the LCS

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.060 
amongst the lower teens in the LCS

do<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:32.930> think<00:04:33.080> benefited<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.530> most<00:04:33.620> from<00:04:33.740> the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
do you think benefited the most from the

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.350 
do you think benefited the most from the
roster<00:04:34.220> swaps<00:04:34.430> probably<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.210> would<00:04:35.330> say

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
roster swaps probably I would say

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.510 
roster swaps probably I would say
complexity<00:04:35.810> came<00:04:35.960> out<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.200> top<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.680> between

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
complexity came out on top of between

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.610 
complexity came out on top of between
those<00:04:37.700> two<00:04:37.910> teams<00:04:38.060> but<00:04:38.480> certainly<00:04:38.840> my<00:04:39.380> water

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
those two teams but certainly my water

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.680 
those two teams but certainly my water
is<00:04:39.890> my<00:04:40.250> pick<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:40.790> top<00:04:41.000> two<00:04:41.180> supports<00:04:41.600> in

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
is my pick for like top two supports in

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.480 
is my pick for like top two supports in
the<00:04:41.750> North<00:04:41.900> America<00:04:42.230> like<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.440> think<00:04:42.500> he's<00:04:43.250> very

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
the North America like I think he's very

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.550 
the North America like I think he's very
very<00:04:43.730> good<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.180> he's<00:04:44.360> he's<00:04:44.960> able<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.380> make

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
very good that he's he's able to make

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.200 
very good that he's he's able to make
plays<00:04:45.800> as<00:04:46.010> well<00:04:46.040> communicate<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.820> team

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
plays as well communicate to the team

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.400 
plays as well communicate to the team
and<00:04:47.360> typically<00:04:47.720> that's<00:04:47.900> what<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.110> won<00:04:48.260> this

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
and typically that's what you won this

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.600 
and typically that's what you won this
support<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.740> want<00:04:48.890> support<00:04:49.040> that's<00:04:49.280> able<00:04:49.490> to

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
support you want support that's able to

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.610 
support you want support that's able to
make<00:04:49.880> plays<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.210> communicate<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.260> that<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
make plays and communicate is that the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.050 
make plays and communicate is that the
case<00:04:51.770> with<00:04:51.920> Porto<00:04:52.220> or<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.730> he<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.910> different

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
case with Porto or is he a different

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.880 
case with Porto or is he a different
type<00:04:53.330> of<00:04:53.360> support<00:04:53.510> but<00:04:54.110> toys<00:04:54.290> a<00:04:54.380> person<00:04:54.740> who

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
type of support but toys a person who

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.430 
type of support but toys a person who
who<00:04:55.610> originally<00:04:56.000> mean<00:04:56.300> like<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> solo<00:04:57.020> Lane<00:04:57.260> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
who originally mean like a solo Lane and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.170 
who originally mean like a solo Lane and
then<00:04:57.530> moved<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.890> support<00:04:58.610> so<00:04:58.730> he<00:04:58.850> has<00:04:59.000> some

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
then moved to support so he has some

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.910 
then moved to support so he has some
mechanical<00:04:59.510> school<00:04:59.720> from<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.350> solo<00:05:00.590> Lane<00:05:00.770> to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
mechanical school from the solo Lane to

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.710 
mechanical school from the solo Lane to
be<00:05:01.010> able<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.160> bring<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.730> support<00:05:02.120> role<00:05:02.330> and

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
be able to bring to the support role and

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.270 
be able to bring to the support role and
that's<00:05:02.810> why<00:05:03.470> we<00:05:03.620> picked<00:05:03.800> him<00:05:03.860> up<00:05:03.980> because<00:05:04.130> we

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
that's why we picked him up because we

saw potential there how long do you see

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.530 
saw potential there how long do you see
