00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.910 

let's<00:01:21.330> try<00:01:21.600> stand<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.939> works<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> we're<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
let's try stand up it works now we're on

blocked<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:31.290> by<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.310> way<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.939> most

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
blocked at all this by the way is most

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.609 
blocked at all this by the way is most
likely<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.470> patched<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.729> fast

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
likely going to get patched so fast

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.999 
likely going to get patched so fast
because<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> lets<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> map<00:01:40.009> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
because it lets you out of the map and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.179 
because it lets you out of the map and
if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.909> want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> dick
