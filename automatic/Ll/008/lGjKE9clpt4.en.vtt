00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.819
 we are so and there again 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.460
 with a little review on the bose 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.429
 two headphones have the words once before 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.139
 have generally unpacked to the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.460
 You can say headphones first 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.710
 kept very simple 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.320
 nicely done here with the stable 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.359
 metal rails up here very fine leather 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 upholstered and fantastic 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.600
 This earphone is the earcups 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.309
 are really very softly padded 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.780
 you have a lot here 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.520
 pleasant feeling if you are on the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.230
 head has and you usually think you have 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.460
 no headphones has anything 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.500
 of course, what is very fine for 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.160
 especially the big headphones that that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.270
 close completely 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 handy is also that the cable 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.059
 without deducting problems 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.559
 and just put it back in here 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.829
 what the whole thing again a whole 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.010
 corner portable makes the bag to the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.930
 headphones is not just cloth bag 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.680
 very stable but a few 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.820
 After all, she will prevent scratches and scratches 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.340
 sonically sonic one can to the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.670
 headphones say they sound very good 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.650
 very clear are especially suitable for yes 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.830
 you have to say classical music or 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.780
 maybe close or very instrument 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.920
 stressed music, however, not for 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.750
 Bass -heavy music because the bass reproduction 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.909
 but not as strong as others 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 Bose headphones are then available 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.340
 for example the on ear headphones the bose 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.159
 e2 the stronger ones are for that too 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 recommend if you pop especially rap 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 listening to music or something similar or otherwise 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.049
 of course the beats by dr dre series of 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.680
 In terms of quality, you have to say the Bose 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.320
 headphones are beautifully processed 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 look simple and noble from bose typical 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.340
 and if you are looking for good headphones 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.930
 but not for more modern or 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.009
 Basslastig I have to use 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.950
 but rather for calmer 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.690
 instrumental music 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.120
 Or you have to say for singing 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.700
 the bose headphones are very good very good 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.440
 suitable and you have really great here 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 headphones for a price of about 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.120
 140 euro I hope that pure review 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.950
 Failed if you unboxing too 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.390
 you want to see the headphones clicks 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.970
 on main channel there is also still 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.750
 other unboxing videos and reviews so 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.750
