to cut out the red just to decide
on<00:02:25.549> how<00:02:25.819> wide<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.150> should<00:02:26.599> make<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.900> center

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
on how wide I should make that center

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.130 
on how wide I should make that center
portion<00:02:27.439> and<00:02:27.829> then<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.549> removed<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.989> did

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
portion and then I removed it and I did

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.860 
portion and then I removed it and I did
the<00:02:30.290> same<00:02:30.500> thing<00:02:30.560> for<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.640> other<00:02:31.819> side

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the same thing for the other side

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.839 
the same thing for the other side
okay<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:33.890> gets<00:02:34.099> a<00:02:34.159> little<00:02:34.280> bit<00:02:34.459> tricky<00:02:34.670> here

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
okay this gets a little bit tricky here

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.339 
okay this gets a little bit tricky here
because<00:02:34.909> I<00:02:35.209> actually<00:02:35.420> make<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.780> mistake<00:02:36.319> now

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
because I actually make a mistake now

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.300 
because I actually make a mistake now
what<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.769> wanted<00:02:37.129> to<00:02:37.189> do<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.579> put<00:02:38.180> two<00:02:38.420> flags

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
what I wanted to do was put two flags

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.000 
what I wanted to do was put two flags
side-by-side<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:41.569> where<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.230> two<00:02:42.439> stripes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
side-by-side so where the two stripes

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.670 
side-by-side so where the two stripes
touch<00:02:43.579> in<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.939> center<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.629> needs<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.200> twice

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
touch in the center it needs to be twice

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.039 
touch in the center it needs to be twice
the<00:02:45.920> thickness<00:02:46.099> so<00:02:46.939> as<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.599> see<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.019> I

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
the thickness so as you can see here I

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.380 
the thickness so as you can see here I
had<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.409> one<00:02:48.650> stripe<00:02:48.980> in<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.220> center<00:02:49.579> but<00:02:50.269> it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
had that one stripe in the center but it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.699 
had that one stripe in the center but it
actually<00:02:50.569> needs<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:51.019> be<00:02:51.079> twice<00:02:51.439> that

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
actually needs to be twice that

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.960 
actually needs to be twice that
thickness<00:02:51.980> because<00:02:52.430> we're<00:02:52.579> gonna<00:02:52.670> end<00:02:52.879> up

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
thickness because we're gonna end up

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.819 
thickness because we're gonna end up
with<00:02:53.180> two<00:02:53.870> flags

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
with two flags

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.580 
with two flags
so<00:02:55.340> each<00:02:55.549> flag<00:02:55.879> has<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.269> have<00:02:56.390> two<00:02:56.720> red<00:02:57.200> stripes

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
so each flag has to have two red stripes

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.649 
so each flag has to have two red stripes
on<00:02:57.859> either<00:02:58.040> side<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.700> what<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.180> did<00:02:59.269> is<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.629> just

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
on either side so what I did is I just

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.479 
on either side so what I did is I just
cut<00:03:00.139> a<00:03:00.349> piece<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.889> jello<00:03:01.099> that<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.340> had

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
cut a piece of the jello that I had

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.059 
cut a piece of the jello that I had
removed<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.060> put<00:03:02.239> it<00:03:02.329> right<00:03:02.359> back<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.290> as

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
removed and put it right back in so as

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.819 
removed and put it right back in so as
you<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.400> see<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:05.359> put<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.319> cookie<00:03:06.650> cutter

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
you can see I put that cookie cutter

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.800 
you can see I put that cookie cutter
back<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:07.670> didn't<00:03:07.970> quite<00:03:08.060> fit<00:03:08.150> well<00:03:08.599> so

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
back in and it didn't quite fit well so

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.569 
back in and it didn't quite fit well so
I<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:08.900> sliced<00:03:09.319> off<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> piece<00:03:09.889> of<00:03:10.040> jell-o<00:03:10.250> in

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
I just sliced off a piece of jell-o in

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.849 
I just sliced off a piece of jell-o in
the<00:03:11.000> description<00:03:11.480> box<00:03:11.659> below<00:03:11.900> I'm<00:03:12.590> gonna

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
the description box below I'm gonna

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.410 
the description box below I'm gonna
provide<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.430> with<00:03:13.639> approximate

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
provide you with approximate

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.509 
provide you with approximate
measurements<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.170> each<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.680> these<00:03:15.799> stripes<00:03:16.220> if

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
measurements of each of these stripes if

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.069 
measurements of each of these stripes if
you<00:03:16.730> use<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.239> 9<00:03:17.720> by<00:03:18.319> 13<00:03:18.920> inch<00:03:19.340> pan<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.930> way

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
you use a 9 by 13 inch pan and that way

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.229 
you use a 9 by 13 inch pan and that way
you'll<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.260> an<00:03:21.470> idea<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.829> how<00:03:22.010> thick<00:03:22.430> or<00:03:22.670> how

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
you'll have an idea of how thick or how

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.729 
you'll have an idea of how thick or how
thin<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.870> make<00:03:24.049> these<00:03:24.260> stripes<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.930> ultimately

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
thin to make these stripes so ultimately

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.009 
thin to make these stripes so ultimately
you<00:03:28.129> need<00:03:28.310> three<00:03:28.849> stripes<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.389> your<00:03:29.510> pan<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
you need three stripes in your pan the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.990 
you need three stripes in your pan the
one<00:03:30.199> in<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.440> center<00:03:30.799> should<00:03:31.310> be<00:03:31.370> about<00:03:31.699> twice

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
one in the center should be about twice

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.180 
one in the center should be about twice
the<00:03:32.269> thickness<00:03:32.449> as<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.900> one<00:03:33.440> on<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.980> edges

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
the thickness as the one on the edges

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.689 
the thickness as the one on the edges
now<00:03:37.190> we're<00:03:37.430> gonna<00:03:37.519> take<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:38.030> white<00:03:38.629> jello

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
now we're gonna take that white jello

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.879 
now we're gonna take that white jello
mixture<00:03:40.699> that<00:03:41.269> we<00:03:41.449> made<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:42.260> you're<00:03:42.769> gonna

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
mixture that we made and you're gonna

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.629 
mixture that we made and you're gonna
pour<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.370> into<00:03:43.519> those<00:03:44.239> empty<00:03:44.750> spaces<00:03:45.139> I<00:03:45.739> wasn't

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
pour it into those empty spaces I wasn't

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.189 
pour it into those empty spaces I wasn't
sure<00:03:46.730> if<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:46.879> was<00:03:46.940> gonna<00:03:47.060> use<00:03:47.359> all<00:03:47.659> of<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.959> white

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
sure if I was gonna use all of the white

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.619 
sure if I was gonna use all of the white
but<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.620> ended<00:03:48.889> up<00:03:48.980> pouring<00:03:49.310> almost<00:03:50.150> all<00:03:50.359> of<00:03:50.510> it

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
but I ended up pouring almost all of it

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.020 
but I ended up pouring almost all of it
into<00:03:50.780> these<00:03:51.019> spaces<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:52.129> did<00:03:52.370> overflow<00:03:53.000> a

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
into these spaces it did overflow a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.819 
into these spaces it did overflow a
little<00:03:53.329> when<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.690> picked<00:03:54.229> it<00:03:54.290> up<00:03:54.409> and<00:03:54.560> moved<00:03:54.620> it

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
little when I picked it up and moved it

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.409 
little when I picked it up and moved it
to<00:03:54.919> put<00:03:55.069> at<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.190> refrigerator<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.970> chill<00:03:56.000> but

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
to put at the refrigerator to chill but

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.509 
to put at the refrigerator to chill but
that's<00:03:56.599> okay<00:03:56.989> because<00:03:57.680> as<00:03:57.859> you'll<00:03:58.040> see<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
that's okay because as you'll see the

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.949 
that's okay because as you'll see the
nice<00:03:58.849> side<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.299> flag<00:03:59.510> will<00:03:59.659> be<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.870> the

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
nice side of the flag will be on the

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:00.849 
nice side of the flag will be on the
bottom<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.409> pan

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
bottom of the pan

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.580 
bottom of the pan
so<00:04:01.310> once<00:04:01.609> you've<00:04:02.090> allowed<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:03.079> white<00:04:03.290> portion

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
so once you've allowed the white portion

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.309 
so once you've allowed the white portion
to<00:04:04.250> firm<00:04:04.790> up<00:04:04.819> in<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.239> refrigerator<00:04:05.840> that's

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
to firm up in the refrigerator that's

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.170 
to firm up in the refrigerator that's
gonna<00:04:06.440> take<00:04:06.680> about<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.919> half<00:04:07.159> an<00:04:07.310> hour<00:04:07.430> or<00:04:07.669> so<00:04:07.909> I

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
gonna take about a half an hour or so I

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.500 
gonna take about a half an hour or so I
took<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.310> maple<00:04:10.310> leaf<00:04:10.340> shaped<00:04:10.729> cookie<00:04:11.060> cutter<00:04:11.090> i

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
took a maple leaf shaped cookie cutter i

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.759 
took a maple leaf shaped cookie cutter i
greased<00:04:11.900> it<00:04:11.989> with<00:04:12.109> a<00:04:12.169> little<00:04:12.349> bit<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.530> cooking

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
greased it with a little bit of cooking

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.770 
greased it with a little bit of cooking
spray<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.280> then<00:04:13.370> it<00:04:13.849> just<00:04:14.030> pressed<00:04:14.329> it<00:04:14.510> into

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
spray and then it just pressed it into

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.960 
spray and then it just pressed it into
the<00:04:14.900> jello<00:04:15.169> I<00:04:15.470> pressed<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.159> firmly<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.729> try<00:04:16.909> to

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
the jello I pressed it firmly to try to

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.219 
the jello I pressed it firmly to try to
get<00:04:17.150> nice<00:04:17.479> crisp<00:04:18.049> lines<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.690> pulled

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
get nice crisp lines and then I pulled

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.890 
get nice crisp lines and then I pulled
it<00:04:21.380> out<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.610> actually<00:04:22.789> came<00:04:23.180> out<00:04:23.360> fairly

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
it out and it actually came out fairly

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.620 
it out and it actually came out fairly
cleanly<00:04:24.590> if<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:25.550> allow<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.820> jello<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.389> set

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
cleanly if you allow the jello to set

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.370 
cleanly if you allow the jello to set
properly<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.169> shouldn't<00:04:27.500> be<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> problem<00:04:27.849> and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
properly it shouldn't be a problem and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.050 
properly it shouldn't be a problem and
as<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:30.530> can<00:04:30.680> see<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:31.130> gonna<00:04:31.220> end<00:04:31.490> up<00:04:31.639> with

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.680 
as you can see I'm gonna end up with
three<00:04:32.690> flags<00:04:33.320> here<00:04:34.130> one<00:04:34.849> on<00:04:35.000> top<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.539> other

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
you're gonna pour it into these spaces

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.280 
you're gonna pour it into these spaces
you<00:04:46.550> made<00:04:46.760> with<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.060> cookie<00:04:47.300> cutter<00:04:47.510> for<00:04:48.230> the

center<00:04:48.770> part<00:04:49.040> of<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.160> flag<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:51.110> was<00:04:51.260> a

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
center part of the flag and I was a

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.810 
center part of the flag and I was a
little<00:04:51.620> bit<00:04:51.740> careless<00:04:51.980> when<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.310> was<00:04:52.430> porting

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.540 
little bit careless when I was porting
into<00:04:53.000> here<00:04:53.270> but<00:04:54.050> as<00:04:54.350> I<00:04:54.380> mentioned<00:04:55.010> before<00:04:55.130> the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
into here but as I mentioned before the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.830 
into here but as I mentioned before the
pretty<00:04:55.760> side<00:04:56.000> of<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.150> flags<00:04:56.360> gonna<00:04:56.570> be<00:04:56.690> on<00:04:56.780> the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
pretty side of the flags gonna be on the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840 
pretty side of the flags gonna be on the
bottom<00:04:57.020> so<00:04:57.740> if<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:57.950> do<00:04:58.070> spill<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.430> little<00:04:58.580> it's

bottom so if you do spill a little it's
not<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.330> end<00:04:59.450> of<00:04:59.480> the<00:04:59.570> world<00:04:59.720> allow<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.380> to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
not the end of the world allow that to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.310 
not the end of the world allow that to
set<00:05:01.070> in<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.760> refrigerator<00:05:02.360> it's<00:05:02.960> gonna<00:05:03.110> take

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
set in the refrigerator it's gonna take

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.350 
set in the refrigerator it's gonna take
another<00:05:03.590> half<00:05:03.800> hour<00:05:04.040> so<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.520> firm<00:05:04.970> up<00:05:05.000> I

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
another half hour so to firm up I

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.930 
another half hour so to firm up I
wouldn't<00:05:05.900> rush<00:05:06.140> this<00:05:06.410> part<00:05:06.680> make<00:05:07.400> sure<00:05:07.670> your

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
wouldn't rush this part make sure your

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.390 
wouldn't rush this part make sure your
jello<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.590> completely<00:05:09.590> set<00:05:09.830> before<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:10.190> try

jello is completely set before you try

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.280 
jello is completely set before you try
to<00:05:10.460> lift<00:05:10.730> these<00:05:10.970> out<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.330> pan<00:05:11.630> or<00:05:11.870> they

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
will fall apart so gently lift them out

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.430 
will fall apart so gently lift them out
of<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.680> pan<00:05:15.890> and<00:05:16.220> place<00:05:16.370> them<00:05:16.730> onto<00:05:16.910> a<00:05:17.450> serving

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
of the pan and place them onto a serving

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.580 
of the pan and place them onto a serving
plate<00:05:19.190> and<00:05:19.810> you<00:05:20.810> can<00:05:20.840> add<00:05:21.110> some<00:05:21.350> fresh

strawberries and some whipped cream to
this<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.690> would<00:05:23.780> make<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:23.990> really<00:05:24.530> nice

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
this and it would make a really nice

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.110 
this and it would make a really nice
Canada<00:05:25.670> Day<00:05:25.880> dessert<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:26.570> there<00:05:27.560> they<00:05:27.770> are<00:05:28.120> I

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
Canada Day dessert and there they are I

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.880

was<00:05:29.540> really<00:05:29.960> happy<00:05:30.170> with<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.560> way<00:05:30.680> these

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
was really happy with the way these

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.040 
was really happy with the way these
turned<00:05:31.370> out<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:32.090> red<00:05:32.300> does<00:05:32.540> bleed<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.870> little

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
turned out the red does bleed a little

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.200 
turned out the red does bleed a little
into<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.620> white<00:05:34.010> around<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.490> edges<00:05:34.550> but

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
into the white around the edges but

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.020 
into the white around the edges but
overall<00:05:35.570> it<00:05:36.200> was<00:05:36.350> it<00:05:36.620> was<00:05:36.770> awesome<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.550> I

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
overall it was it was awesome and I

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.350 
overall it was it was awesome and I
ended<00:05:38.270> up<00:05:38.360> with<00:05:38.510> six<00:05:38.870> flags<00:05:39.170> in<00:05:39.710> one<00:05:40.310> pan<00:05:40.730> and

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
ended up with six flags in one pan and

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.490 
ended up with six flags in one pan and
you<00:05:41.480> most<00:05:41.720> certainly<00:05:41.900> can<00:05:42.170> make<00:05:42.200> these

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
you most certainly can make these

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.060 
you most certainly can make these
smaller<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.280> trick<00:05:43.490> is<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.640> find<00:05:44.000> a<00:05:44.270> smaller

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
smaller the trick is to find a smaller

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.530 
smaller the trick is to find a smaller
maple<00:05:46.070> leaf<00:05:46.220> shaped<00:05:46.520> cookie<00:05:46.850> cutter<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.360> cut

out<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.810> center<00:05:48.200> portion<00:05:49.000> hope<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.090> give

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
out that center portion hope you give

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.690 
out that center portion hope you give
this<00:05:50.330> one<00:05:50.450> a<00:05:50.510> try<00:05:50.600> I<00:05:51.110> do<00:05:51.890> hope<00:05:52.280> that<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.520> get<00:05:52.670> a

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
this one a try I do hope that you get a

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.610
