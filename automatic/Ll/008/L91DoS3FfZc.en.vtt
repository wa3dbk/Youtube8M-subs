00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello little friends here who speaks is the channel 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.060
 already paid 12 for another episode of the trash 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.180
 luxury as you can see has begun 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:20.040
 very fast until I already voted galera that 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.270
 not sold the sale still attacked 9495 with 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.800
 so I gave a cop and also in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.789
 Carlos Martins I saw that I was not going to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 sell no way 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 We picked up our team is still in the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.130
 air still attacked gomes there not yet 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 won Mario Gomez will understand or not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.700
 people will take the team out of the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.930
 against the rudder there the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.140
 pasta and cool kimi and the barclays is davi 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 silva balotelli marco ruiz was not going to speak 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.800
 with him but it's podolski 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.800
 and look what happens soon enough 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.989
 maximum penalty this time, I'm fine 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.550
 I thought it would start in confusion, neither would that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.250
 penalty I could not see the replay 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 It's rather all right so it was not so 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 declared I think it could be 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 marked by the team and it was there did go 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 podolski has opened 1 to 0 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.969
 then to the despair by the door of my 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.990
 purpose of the gomes and gomes themselves that the 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:12.420
 game to sell you the fry robot 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.490
 head and make a goal the goal 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.829
 Are you an expert at doing this? 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.139
 It was not good but it is crossing like 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:22.439
 nobody on our team and with that we 

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:24.779
 managed to draw 1 - 1 goalkeeper wender 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.069
 The goalkeeper is leaving so continue the 

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:28.259
 goalkeeper was better at match and 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.929
 got the equalizer unfortunately soon 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.909
 then we went and put some contracts 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.920
 players tidying the team put the close 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.810
 Back there, I got tired of Mario. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 Gomez, you made it to yourselves. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.219
 We're going straight to the next one. 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.229
 match against error and br 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.149
 another team of the bar is this time a 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.520
 little weaker a little bit more 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.259
 appealing in speed than in the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 player skill is more beauty 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.450
 Let's see how the game started. 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.239
 new competition was to understand is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.700
 guys are seeing there it 's me 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.919
 sequence of doing the time study is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.639
 every time I tell myself or I do I have suffered 

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:06.470
 penalty 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:10.590
 there he hit the goalkeeper's oil jec 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.300
 it's that I hit the corner came the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.880
 government the people so in slow motion 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.680
 you realize how Amano indicated that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.040
 ridiculous beauty thing 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.959
 We will continue there after 27 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.830
 second wins and makes good play and looks only 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.650
 comes 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.239
 You're a good player, you told me there. 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.400
 buy a steering wheel I think it is 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.410
 important it plays so well but it goes 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.959
 right to know you know more than I come and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.640
 actually he plays too mount it 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.800
 goes up a lot to do this function is 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.800
 get behind the shoe is playing 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.690
 Very well, you 're doing landings and not 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.610
 then it is to see he looked old with the beautiful 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.720
 ball to the wheel and dog blues and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.610
 crude oil today the phase a of the sling 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.260
 then it's the first goal he made is 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610
 to do after he scored, he was 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 really dude 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.850
 Mario Gomez goes to shit looks only the goal of 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.090
 miroslav karhan - old energy on high 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.799
 he is cool and can not replace 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.720
 then it is 28 -headed world of 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.400
 chicharito right will understand 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.709
 he was in the middle of the time that the powder 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.480
 to lose two highs but the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.329
 face that used very well and the ball went 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.579
 exactly in the range of 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.250
 I managed to do it two years later 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:24.329
 Podolski to see me see Sunday the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:29.250
 Goalkeeper is only bad and the fire google miller 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:33.660
 It's 3 in 2 and victory is ours. 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.340
 there 32 sucks the mbr podolski was better 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.620
 on the pitch and we got another win 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.600
 with ten missing points little to 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.060
 To be, to be able to stay in this 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.470
 media division and lloyds is not 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.900
 I can speak his name, I think it must be 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.790
 so the lakers or hate do not know how it is 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.220
 It's just that the team needs to be redone again. 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.870
 because in this video we will have three parties 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.790
 of the allied base is that one more 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.500
 match that again against the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.750
 barclays team only has team bar 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.269
 said fifa are you going to shit okay that is a 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.310
 different from the other, did not repeat guess 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.590
 which repeated two players if you are 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.410
 see these three teams there more beautiful 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.069
 11 a galera loves to get low and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.620
 Look at the club when the club 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.790
 based it will show that really a 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.340
 football genius 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.070
 the play had a soft voice that seems to be 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.500
 much more effective in your brain than 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.550
 Will you agree with me more easily? 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.000
 perozo love close or smaller with Mario 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.440
 gomez and sucks mario gomez kicked because 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.570
 comes one more ball 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.590
 beautiful ball for the half miller will play 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.930
 this ball for him 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.169
 milan 10 11 dominating and looking category 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.440
 look at category look category one 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.330
 tinkle over the keeper denton 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.169
 opponent ball over goalkeeper not 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:53.580
 I did not know Cavadinha great goal 2-0 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.590
 two he turned old cloud rapazeada and 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.840
 comes more goals because it's a good move 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.849
 thomas muller to hit the ball left over 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.410
 he realizes the head goal 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:07.530
 in addition to the backlog area kicked the goalkeeper 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:10.320
 defended looks at goal in the on world 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.330
 Goal stepped on the guys go sponsored 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.669
 and I kicked his defender 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.080
 He kept looking at the ball and I got 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.330
 sure that the guy was breaking the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.699
 control the time pressed the button to 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.199
 take the ball list but it's over 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.659
 Nothing happening, right? 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:29.039
 after a longer time of close almost 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:31.229
 40 er twitter it face to face does not give 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.270
 even in the club and despite having a 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.740
 summer taller he thinks sheltered more 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.050
 high on 12 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.680
 dakar the close yields much more danger 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.210
 You'll understand , it's fifa thing , right? 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.870
 animals so that the gum and also has 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.370
 another number high gum punctured like a 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.110
 boss who closed the score 5 to 0 here 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.750
 the garbage a kick on top of it to laugh at us 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.900
 blue and warriors the streets that face 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.300
 also create blue warriors of will 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.490
 blue is certain that it was not up to then 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.400
 it works for my fault I do not read it right 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.650
 the name of your team but beauty 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.560
 boy we got the missing victory 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.570
 Little here to finish the games 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.849
 of the first division and what corinthians 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.889
 finish here we'll probably go 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.020
 play a few more matches and 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.210
 we will buy branches is probably not the 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.779
 corinthians to determine whether the division 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.940
 there 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.900
 we will close this series with the team 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.669
 german and 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.490
 I want to know you leave again, will you? 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.070

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.600
 always cool there I chose one if you guys 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.039
 choose a league a country that gives 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.930
 to set up a bronze team and a team 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.490
 silver the gold team I think it stays 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.860
 cooler than putting the team together 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.750
 gold handsome beauty then for today 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.280
 This is a hug for everyone. 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.870
 forget to leave that favorite game 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.789
 but everyone here to help spread the word 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.789
 of the video and the ice screen
