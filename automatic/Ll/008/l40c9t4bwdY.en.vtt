so<00:01:43.200> once<00:01:43.500> he<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.920> dead<00:01:44.280> once<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.759> arc<00:01:44.970> was

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so once he was dead once that arc was

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.819 
so once he was dead once that arc was
complete<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.840> wow<00:01:46.020> there's<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.619> going

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
complete and like wow there's not going

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
complete and like wow there's not going
to<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.009> any<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.700> Star<00:01:48.030> Wars<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.509> some

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to be any more Star Wars like some

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
to be any more Star Wars like some
spin-off<00:01:49.049> games<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> stuff<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.860> course<00:01:50.040> I

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
spin-off games and stuff of course I

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
spin-off games and stuff of course I
figured<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.119> no<00:01:51.270> more<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.659> big<00:01:51.990> movies<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
figured but no more like big movies and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
figured but no more like big movies and
I<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.340> wrong<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.329> we<00:01:54.390> have<00:01:54.540> episode

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I was wrong because now we have episode

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
I was wrong because now we have episode
7<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> had<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.159> assume<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.820> Luke

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
7 now I had to assume that that was Luke

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.179 
7 now I had to assume that that was Luke
talking<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> beginning<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.560> doing<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
talking at the beginning right doing the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
talking at the beginning right doing the
voiceover<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.119> threw<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> was

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
voiceover but threw me off of it was

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.319 
voiceover but threw me off of it was
when<00:02:01.170> he<00:02:01.290> talked<00:02:01.500> about<00:02:01.740> how<00:02:01.920> his<00:02:02.130> sister<00:02:02.579> was

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
when he talked about how his sister was

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.030 
when he talked about how his sister was
force<00:02:03.570> sensitive<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.140> well<00:02:04.320> which<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.890> make

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
force sensitive as well which would make

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.800 
force sensitive as well which would make
sense<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.060> Anakin<00:02:06.479> was<00:02:06.600> force

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
sense because you know Anakin was force

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.419 
sense because you know Anakin was force
sensitive<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.530> Luke<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:07.950> sensitive

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
sensitive and if Luke was for sensitive

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
sensitive and if Luke was for sensitive
then<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.270> Leia<00:02:09.690> could<00:02:09.989> very<00:02:10.170> well

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
then you know Leia could very well

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.780 
then you know Leia could very well
before<00:02:10.739> sensitive<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.910> wasn't<00:02:12.120> aware<00:02:12.480> of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
before sensitive I just wasn't aware of

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.280 
before sensitive I just wasn't aware of
however<00:02:13.239> i'm<00:02:13.390> pretty<00:02:13.569> sure<00:02:13.750> cuz<00:02:13.959> i<00:02:14.019> actually

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
however i'm pretty sure cuz i actually

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.470 
however i'm pretty sure cuz i actually
did<00:02:14.469> read<00:02:14.650> like<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.280> or<00:02:15.430> two<00:02:15.459> star<00:02:15.969> wars<00:02:16.180> books

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
did read like one or two star wars books

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.149 
did read like one or two star wars books
you<00:02:16.959> know<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.349> spin<00:02:17.620> off<00:02:17.769> with<00:02:17.980> like

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
you know the little spin off with like

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.729 
you know the little spin off with like
what<00:02:19.090> was<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.599> was<00:02:19.719> Han<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.140> Leia's<00:02:20.379> kids

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
what was it it was Han and Leia's kids

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.530 
what was it it was Han and Leia's kids
you<00:02:20.950> know<00:02:21.099> Jaden<00:02:21.790> was<00:02:22.000> one<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.269> them<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.480> think

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you know Jaden was one of them I think

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.839 
you know Jaden was one of them I think
anyway<00:02:23.109> like<00:02:23.469> he<00:02:23.829> was<00:02:23.980> for<00:02:24.189> sensitive<00:02:24.670> right

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
anyway like he was for sensitive right

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.280 
anyway like he was for sensitive right
and<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.420> would<00:02:25.540> mean<00:02:25.659> that<00:02:25.719> either<00:02:25.989> like

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and so that would mean that either like

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.440 
and so that would mean that either like
Leia<00:02:26.530> had<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.069> Orhan<00:02:27.579> had<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.969> be<00:02:28.090> or<00:02:28.299> there

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
Leia had to be Orhan had to be or there

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.240 
Leia had to be Orhan had to be or there

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
things for me I just kind of I do wish

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.420 
things for me I just kind of I do wish
it<00:03:19.989> had<00:03:20.079> told<00:03:20.229> me<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.440> little<00:03:20.680> bit<00:03:20.919> more<00:03:21.190> about

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
it had told me a little bit more about

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.250 
it had told me a little bit more about
what<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.669> could<00:03:21.879> expect<00:03:22.359> you<00:03:22.599> know<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:23.109> a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
what I could expect you know just a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.649 
what I could expect you know just a
little<00:03:23.530> bit<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:24.099> maybe<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.269> was<00:03:25.359> covered<00:03:25.599> in

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
little bit but maybe that was covered in

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.789 
little bit but maybe that was covered in
the<00:03:25.780> first<00:03:25.959> trailer<00:03:26.199> and<00:03:26.440> I'm<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.680> not

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
the first trailer and I'm just not

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.319 
the first trailer and I'm just not
remembering<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.400> right<00:03:27.609> now<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.000> don't<00:03:28.239> know

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
remembering that right now I don't know

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.819

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
either way it was cool to see I thought

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.319 
either way it was cool to see I thought

its job and again I'm casual fan and
sofa<00:03:46.359> got<00:03:46.479> me<00:03:46.629> excited<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:47.169> can't<00:03:47.379> imagine<00:03:47.560> how

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
sofa got me excited I can't imagine how

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.740 
sofa got me excited I can't imagine how
the<00:03:48.310> bigger<00:03:48.609> fans<00:03:48.879> must<00:03:49.090> have<00:03:49.269> held<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
the bigger fans must have held and

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.149 
the bigger fans must have held and
although<00:03:49.989> at<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.229> end<00:03:50.379> of<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.530> trailer<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.859> was

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
although at the end of the trailer I was

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.259 
although at the end of the trailer I was
hoping<00:03:51.459> there<00:03:51.579> would<00:03:51.669> be<00:03:51.699> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:51.970> bit<00:03:52.150> more

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
hoping there would be a little bit more

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.969 
hoping there would be a little bit more
because<00:03:52.449> again<00:03:52.870> I<00:03:52.900> wasn't<00:03:53.169> exactly<00:03:53.409> sure<00:03:53.739> I

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
because again I wasn't exactly sure I

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.550 
because again I wasn't exactly sure I
got<00:03:54.280> everything<00:03:54.489> that<00:03:54.879> I<00:03:54.909> wanted<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.299> get

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
ending with Han and Chewie that was

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.629 
ending with Han and Chewie that was

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.129 
great that was really cool just a quick
thought<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.120> occurred<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.510> me<00:04:01.659> after<00:04:01.780> I

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
thought that occurred to me after I

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.899

change shirts for no reason mostly

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.069 
change shirts for no reason mostly
because<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.239> know<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.419> guys<00:04:04.599> didn't<00:04:04.900> get<00:04:04.959> to

and<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.299> I<00:04:07.329> wanted<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.689> point<00:04:07.930> out<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:08.290> whole

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
and so I wanted to point out the whole

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.800 
and so I wanted to point out the whole
you<00:04:08.979> know<00:04:09.099> cross<00:04:09.549> lightsaber<00:04:10.090> thing<00:04:10.389> like<00:04:10.659> I

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
you know cross lightsaber thing like I

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.330 
you know cross lightsaber thing like I
do<00:04:10.870> actually<00:04:11.139> think<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.709> lightsaber<00:04:12.129> it

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
do actually think that the lightsaber it

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.830 
do actually think that the lightsaber it
looks<00:04:12.549> pretty<00:04:12.849> cool<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.239> know<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.449> cross<00:04:13.599> one

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
looks pretty cool you know the cross one

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.210 
looks pretty cool you know the cross one
the<00:04:13.959> red<00:04:14.079> one<00:04:14.109> the<00:04:14.409> evil<00:04:14.709> one<00:04:14.859> yeah<00:04:14.979> it<00:04:15.040> looks

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
the red one the evil one yeah it looks

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.399 
the red one the evil one yeah it looks
pretty<00:04:15.280> cool<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:15.669> think<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:16.659> it<00:04:16.750> might<00:04:16.930> not<00:04:16.959> be

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
pretty cool I think and it might not be

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.930 
pretty cool I think and it might not be
remembering<00:04:18.099> it<00:04:18.220> entirely<00:04:18.519> correct<00:04:18.729> because

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
remembering it entirely correct because

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.920 
remembering it entirely correct because
it's<00:04:19.239> been<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.389> while<00:04:19.539> since<00:04:19.659> I've<00:04:19.810> actually

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
it's been a while since I've actually

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.200 
it's been a while since I've actually
seen<00:04:20.259> it<00:04:20.320> but<00:04:21.010> um<00:04:21.190> while<00:04:21.729> I<00:04:21.760> do<00:04:21.880> think<00:04:22.120> it's

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
seen it but um while I do think it's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.100 
seen it but um while I do think it's
cool<00:04:22.389> I<00:04:22.599> don't<00:04:22.900> really<00:04:23.080> think<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.560> a

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
cool I don't really think it's that a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.170 
cool I don't really think it's that a
from<00:04:24.500> what<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.710> recall<00:04:24.949> the<00:04:25.610> little<00:04:25.879> lightsaber

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
from what I recall the little lightsaber

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.790 
from what I recall the little lightsaber
that<00:04:26.389> comes<00:04:26.539> out<00:04:26.689> at<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.900> hilt<00:04:27.139> you<00:04:27.590> know<00:04:27.680> as

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
that comes out at the hilt you know as

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.260 
that comes out at the hilt you know as
most<00:04:28.039> of<00:04:28.159> the<00:04:28.219> main<00:04:28.430> blade<00:04:28.699> but<00:04:28.849> like<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.120> two

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
most of the main blade but like the two

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.700 
most of the main blade but like the two
little<00:04:29.449> blades<00:04:29.750> off<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.110> side<00:04:30.289> to<00:04:30.469> make<00:04:30.500> it

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
little blades off to the side to make it

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.320 
little blades off to the side to make it
look<00:04:30.800> more<00:04:31.099> like<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.310> medieval<00:04:31.580> sword<00:04:32.000> kind<00:04:32.240> of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
look more like a medieval sword kind of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.770 
look more like a medieval sword kind of
do<00:04:32.419> it<00:04:33.199> doesn't<00:04:33.500> seem<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.759> helpful<00:04:34.759> to<00:04:35.150> me<00:04:35.360> at

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
do it doesn't seem that helpful to me at

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.270 
do it doesn't seem that helpful to me at
least<00:04:35.990> not<00:04:36.169> in<00:04:36.289> terms<00:04:36.469> of<00:04:36.620> acting<00:04:36.889> as<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.069> sort

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
least not in terms of acting as a sort

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.610 
least not in terms of acting as a sort
of<00:04:37.400> guard<00:04:37.729> because<00:04:38.030> unless<00:04:38.509> the<00:04:39.050> lightsaber

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
of guard because unless the lightsaber

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.830 
of guard because unless the lightsaber
like<00:04:39.979> hilt<00:04:40.460> itself<00:04:40.939> is<00:04:41.120> made<00:04:41.240> of<00:04:41.419> Frick<00:04:41.659> or

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
like hilt itself is made of Frick or

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.420 
like hilt itself is made of Frick or
cortosis<00:04:42.199> or<00:04:42.530> some<00:04:42.740> other<00:04:42.830> alloy<00:04:43.219> with

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
cortosis or some other alloy with

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.490 
cortosis or some other alloy with
similar<00:04:43.729> properties<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.330> imagine<00:04:45.289> you<00:04:45.349> can

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
similar properties I imagine you can

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.080 
similar properties I imagine you can
just<00:04:45.650> slide<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.949> lightsaber<00:04:46.310> down<00:04:46.610> and<00:04:46.879> cut

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
just slide the lightsaber down and cut

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.869 
just slide the lightsaber down and cut
off<00:04:47.300> those<00:04:47.629> little<00:04:47.990> parts<00:04:48.349> I<00:04:49.099> think<00:04:49.729> we'd<00:04:49.849> have

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:49.879 
off those little parts I think we'd have

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.330 
off those little parts I think we'd have
to<00:04:50.090> be<00:04:50.210> more<00:04:50.449> used<00:04:50.810> for<00:04:51.169> offense<00:04:51.680> like<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.069> jab

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
to be more used for offense like to jab

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.159 
to be more used for offense like to jab
but<00:04:52.729> that<00:04:53.060> just<00:04:53.090> seems<00:04:53.360> kind<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.900> like<00:04:54.020> you're

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
but that just seems kind of like you're

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.170 
but that just seems kind of like you're
going<00:04:54.409> too<00:04:54.530> far<00:04:54.710> out<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:54.860> your<00:04:54.979> way<00:04:55.099> so<00:04:55.520> i<00:04:56.090> think

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
going too far out of your way so i think

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.059 
going too far out of your way so i think
it's<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.449> cool<00:04:56.569> design<00:04:56.750> i<00:04:57.199> just<00:04:57.469> don't<00:04:57.770> see<00:04:57.919> it

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
it's a cool design i just don't see it

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.040 
it's a cool design i just don't see it
being<00:04:58.400> entirely<00:04:58.819> effective<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.750> know<00:04:59.870> it's

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
being entirely effective you know it's

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.110 
being entirely effective you know it's
not<00:05:00.199> going<00:05:00.349> to<00:05:00.439> be<00:05:00.590> like<00:05:01.129> another<00:05:01.400> double

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
not going to be like another double

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.760 
not going to be like another double
bladed<00:05:02.330> lightsaber<00:05:02.449> like<00:05:03.050> darth<00:05:03.259> maul's<00:05:03.500> it's

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
bladed lightsaber like darth maul's it's

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.290 
bladed lightsaber like darth maul's it's
not<00:05:03.949> going<00:05:04.039> to<00:05:04.129> be<00:05:04.219> that<00:05:04.250> cool<00:05:04.639> that<00:05:04.939> new<00:05:05.120> that

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
not going to be that cool that new that

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.450 
not going to be that cool that new that
