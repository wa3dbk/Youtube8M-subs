00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:13.510

 The way I do my best is basic casual 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.710
 Hey why it is safe to say why it is casual Oh you can also make a young 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.789
 Huh 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:28.519
 In addition 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:33.800
 There is almost no one who dislikes casual fashion and fashion is absolutely high in number 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:39.079
 For example, if you ask a woman in a t-shirt or a woman on a mission, it is best to know 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.440
 I think, but when I said what fashion I like men , denim and t sha 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.010
 Many women say 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.290
 It is to fashion a I Anomaa basically prefer 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.310
 If you look into the depths of fashion 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:57.410
 I'm coming in the fashion also the Tteyuu abortion whether style 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.760
 Well I only well dressed Tteyuu I fashion on to without having to worry about value that the sides 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:04.629
 Basically, as long as the stick 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:11.380
 Well I think I want to aim for casual but that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:14.380
 I the Well Kazi but I was popular quite a temporary gyaruo Toka Kazi 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.979
 I don't have any problems with it because it is casual 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.780
 Because now I gyaruo bet that a large What about what that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.380
 Of course the layer you receive 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:30.290
 It is not a hostess or some hostess 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:35.850
 Not all of them, but some of them or something else 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:39.390
 I'm itself also in the gal is now the situation is the era that not really anymore 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.479
 Toka or there f is getting more and more high-Nee system and serves as thin makeup 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.150
 The directionality is changing rapidly 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.920
 Because 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.160
 We also , according to the flow of the times, according to the plainness that has changed 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.480
 It is a time when we have to shift the directionality 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:01.880
 Well, about five to seven years ago, Carroll was in a great boom 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:08.390
 There was a time when I was a guy, but now it is not such a time 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.289
 If you put out your personality too much , your image will look like that of a strangely dressed person 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.640
 I will 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.230
 Please aim to casual to say basically You know Mote Fashion 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.739
 In the brand too 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:27.709
 If there is room in the money in that course hit people say Datte anymore at all okay to economic that 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 I'm not a problem even bought a high brand I try to Soroeyo separately from it that high brand 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:35.220
 There is no need to 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:39.330
 Though it is said that middle brand is not so expensive though 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.630
 It's kind of expensive than the unique labor money 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.190
 Or the whether I American Eagle and Hebibaku a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.060
 I wonder if it is diesel 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.920
 If you say that down in the rest, that from now on 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.080
 Because it is time to get cold 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.870
 That's because the down route Moncler or Monclay is basically a high high brand 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.390
 I that kind of thing or whether Di manner if 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.760
 If you win, it will be the most safe thing 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.630
 But basically if you think that diesel or Abaclo is still expensive 1 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.410
 I think to the point 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.670
 For example, only denim is put in diesel and then it's in UNIQLO 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:21.250
 Dan is align the Parker Toka t-shirt is a little 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.590
 If Dupetika and the Reimu of the day are all Uniqlo 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.300
 Still hey 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:34.390
 So say I wonder if the little there is no commitment to that fashion or referred to as a high depreciation potch 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:38.860
 From a woman Hey I'm so fashionable and fashionable but this is a good person 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:43.030
 There is a possibility that you might think that you are a person in a different world . 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.540
 So it 's good to some extent so you have to stick with a little passion 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:51.820
 More than anything, talk art and that 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.520
 Well there are various sound romance techniques Just the easiest to understand to the other party 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.380
 If you say something that can be shown, it just looks like 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.130
 I Toka hairstyle to Toka beard 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:07.490
 After Hamou the Fashion or to dark complexion 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:13.010
 Be transmitted or that that message that by contrast only easiest way to opponent 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.480
 We want to put it that fashion hit by force more than anything in the best of visual things in simple of 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.320
 I think that 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.440
 Still 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.880
 9 years people fashion to that now was not interested in 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:30.690
 It's such it is also in fact unreasonable is said to be able to have a fashion interest 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:34.670
 That 's cool as long as you don't even notice the value of fashion 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.700
 Or because they are this is you do not know the winter Toka likely to fashion 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:42.740
 I will advise you the easiest way first 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.979
 Please buy the magazine before it is to buy sleeping ne fashion clothes 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:52.250
 Really safari and various Leon and 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:57.919
 I think there's a little adult 's hall, but I'm on this track Hollywood stars and so on 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:02.729
 If it was Marfa, with a person who is the protagonist of the sound type of the movie or with a Hollywood star 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.650
 People like you are riding but I think they are cool looking at them 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:08.720
 Hey first thing 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:13.010
 Please crowded put it in mind in their own 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:18.230
 Theme to these people Toka course Hey safari whether wearing what clothes 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.840
 The clothes that I have listed are only high-class high-class clothes, but they are the style 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.100
 Is ok 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:28.770
 That only the top branded clothes are listed but it looks like that 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.430
 For example , clothes of feeling are put on plate and black 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:38.550
 I also put it in Namba black or American eagle diesel. 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:40.530
 And I naturally if we more and more I like that I dress than this is more of here Do I like my 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.220
 Toka Kakakko be nice 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.650
 But the theme is safe but don't forget the part called casual 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:52.810
 Toka what it is is their sound Favorite fashion 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:55.090
 I If the dressed say this is Toka Naa kinda looks like this Fu this 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.660
 First of all, buy a magazine 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:04.419
 Please do in the next interested to the clothes 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:08.110
 Please buy the full-length mirror in absolute if me dwarf interest in some degree hook 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.880
 In or coordination're hopefully in it yourself 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.880
 For example 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.510
 Wearing clothes that were upper 2 and deep 2 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.240
 And I hope parentheses 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:22.830
 Of course I think the color is the same but it is the balance 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.789
 Sounds of fashion are more important than anything This is the last time I want to say a little bit 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.050
 but 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:31.000
 It is just fit 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.200
 Buy things perfect size to myself for Tteyuu most important thing for the fashion 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.820
 It is 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.830
 For example, high brand of really good things such as Louis Vuitton and Kan Gucci Prada 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.130
 Even if you overdo things and buy 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.460
 If the lucky bag size is Dubodabo it is 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:50.199
 It will be worthless than Uniqlo 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:55.270
 So what you care most about is that it 's a size so I need a file 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:07:00.889
 Be sure to wear four shirts firmly, and have a dubodabo denim and a Kanada buzzer also T-shirt 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:06.110
 Please think when I wear that it is already your money is wasted that it compelling is more of over there 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:08.240
 Exactly the problem I if wearing a perfect size so good even Uniqlo because really useless 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:15.409
 Without parentheses good style 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:19.910
 To buy a full-length mirror line is bought from the First Hey magazine look beautiful 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:24.920

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:29.060

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.740

 Again in I'd m size I thought try to have it that little room is really 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.760
