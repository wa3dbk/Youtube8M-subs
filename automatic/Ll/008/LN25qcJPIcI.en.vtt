00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
was $2.99 per month okay does in case

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.910 
was $2.99 per month okay does in case
you<00:03:25.600> don't<00:03:25.690> like<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.650> go<00:03:26.830> ahead

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
you don't like it you can just go ahead

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.350 
you don't like it you can just go ahead
and<00:03:27.040> not<00:03:27.220> get<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.550> next<00:03:27.730> month<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.180> you're

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
and not get the next month and you're

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.199 
and not get the next month and you're
fine<00:03:28.600> but<00:03:29.440> if<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.890> use<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.070> all<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.340> time<00:03:30.490> it's

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
fine but if you use it all the time it's

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.970 
fine but if you use it all the time it's
worth<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.630> for<00:03:31.660> example<00:03:31.959> right<00:03:32.200> here<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.950> tells

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
worth it for example right here it tells

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.160 
worth it for example right here it tells
me<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.490> uh<00:03:33.790> let's<00:03:34.300> say<00:03:34.420> it's<00:03:34.570> fastest<00:03:34.959> right

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
me that uh let's say it's fastest right

like six miles until you run into a
backup<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.180> delay<00:04:01.450> will<00:04:01.630> be<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> certain

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
backup and the delay will be a certain

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.230 
backup and the delay will be a certain
amount<00:04:02.740> of<00:04:02.860> minutes<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:03.970> pretty

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
useful okay now if you do a lot of

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.170 
useful okay now if you do a lot of
driving<00:04:06.520> like<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.910> do<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:08.140> combine<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:08.739> app

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
driving like I do you combine this app
