on<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.510> map<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.110> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.380> big<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
on this map because it's kind of big but

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.450 
on this map because it's kind of big but
that<00:00:38.820> that's<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.570> strategy<00:00:40.100> there<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.219> some

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that that's the strategy there are some

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360 
that that's the strategy there are some
people<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.969> our<00:00:42.239> thing<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.780> aren't<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:44.129> are

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
people in our thing that aren't that are

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
people in our thing that aren't that are
playing<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.239> aren't<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.600> our

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
