00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.460
 ayurvedic is interesting now people 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.249
 It's a lot of things now, how's it going? 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.269
 You what you found, huh? 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:32.680
 na ayurvedic medicine that you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.410
 snatched uses my word go out 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.300
 Maria and I went in search of healing myself 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.199
 because I had serious symptoms feel 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.410
 shortness of breath 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.780
 I was executive of a multinational and 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.239
 I started to feel short of breath 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.940
 I went to two doctors they gave me until 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.679
 Asthma bomb to take, I used to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.000
 that asthma bomb think people 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.000
 What of my health? 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.210
 I then met a female doctor and the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 and that he recommended some 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.110
 messages some therapies and I 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.930
 I found at first I thought I 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.550
 I needed to live it longer and I thought 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.110
 I had to multiply to count to 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.400
 the people that we want this 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.710
 I want to count on the people who are 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.090
 doing what is being wonderful 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.470
 for my health 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.860
 Then you left the career of economist. 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.960
 Today you work with this. 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.970
 even I left I was an executive of one 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.620
 multinational for 14 years after 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.620
 I worked in the marketing of a mall 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.150
 here of this city and then I found that I 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.710
 I needed to live other things. 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.200
 I already liked doing yoga practiced 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.730
 Yoga did massage all week already 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.370
 had undergone these programs. 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.150
 I paid a revitalization I said I want 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.950
 more 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.710
 In other words, you met me at the beginning. 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.800
 I found ourselves interesting and never there 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 more shortness of breath 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.260
 never to fill the day also beyond 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.120
 I was not scared, I was not afraid. 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.310
 I felt a lot of work 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.930
 big I did not know it was this, it 's a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.330
 very big name 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.360
 a very big shake a lot of plane that 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.980
 also disrupts some of the vata tea 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 so my breathing was very 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.740
 committed 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.450
 Then I went to the doctor and he said to me. 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 You're not going to die and we 're teaching your 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.640
 body is not liking the life that is 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.710
 leading 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.950
 It's interesting and I got it. 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.380
 I said, I'm going to change the cost, what? 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.320
 cost if it does not have this thing right to 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.130
 It's beautiful, it was recent. 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.480
 but now energy is because this thing of the 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.610
 medicine eve work a lot 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.510
 issue of people's energy that people 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.470
 has passenger beauty he the event inside 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.670
 out people are not even up and I told you people 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.060
 for them and we are going to make a program 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.070
 about astrology are various types 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.650
 I think it's so interesting, I think it's 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.340
 Curious, people like this, right? 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.489
 but so doing a basic summary right? 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.390
 within this proposal is known 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.550
 Indian Health How Does Astrology 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.519
 can bring to us she works 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.040
 making diagnosis is this also the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.549
 Vedic appearance she acts in the field so 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.350
 very vast it does not only have to 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.030
 function of its diagnosis but it can 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.160
 behave as a tool for 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.610
 diagnosis within the work of the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.890
 ayurvedic medicine now that enchants 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.080
 in astrology is that part of the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.750
 principle that even the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.959
 that our nature is the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.610
 Serenity is easy when you then 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.799
 observe the astral map 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.780
 Are you actually finding which one? 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.280
 its great alignment with that of the weapon 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.080
 which is an expression that we use the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.430
 terro which means Sanskrit which 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.989
 means alignment with light 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.030
 alignment with the truth 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.459
 so when I saw the study which is the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.110
 his constitution and when he tries to 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.370
 to help therapeutically he wants 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.500
 to rescue that light 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.530
 That's good people, and we can 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.030
 living in the necessary peace of final goods 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.980
 speaks one's own path 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.110
 person lived I think this is what the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.530
 This process is the way of the 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.640
 respond to Maria and Maria from the neighborhood 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.740
 White water was there she is 68 years old and she 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.330
 that she has diabetes in the 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.930
 Ayurvedic medicine exists treatment 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.180
 to eat made treat alex the diabetes 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.340
 depending on the level that it is he 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 can be reversed, I do not know what the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.919
 case of Maria but it is an imbalance 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.400
 mainly dodô xuxa pitta 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.130
 secondarily dodô xuxa vata 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.700
 so she can and it means people 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.830
 could cover very subtly too 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.360
 but in any case one is an imbalance 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.850
 pitta par excellence since you already 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.340
 even got no cure depends on the 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.210
 stage nor the seer month she already takes 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.490
 insulin if it already has other 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.620
 medications are a bit delicate because 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.960
 is the new disease has already settled the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.600
 stages of water anthropology said naeem 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.180
 medical diagnosis are very accurate 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.180
 Roberta knows are six as are six 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.979
 stations are six steps but it is not 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.110
 see the law that more work with 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.060
 issue of prevention for people not 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.340

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.660
