00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.359
 berries and fruits 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.049
 selected to the fourths of the padla point well 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.890

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.070

 did not get here as they say and not fly 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.259
 not flown not days mosquito Well, so she 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.579
 looks made on such furniture 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.680
 wheels on it for convenience 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:57.450
 movement let's say so on the veranda 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:01.259
 somewhere here are these palms here and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.310
 fits 5 pieces they are bigger i am about 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.920
 equals 300 means 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.989
 100 berries well for home say 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.980
 needs no longer need why 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.349
 because let's say I have two three 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.099
 currant bush there black two three bushes 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.200
 red by a little bit it's all just 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.940
 somewhere half a liter jar from here 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.900
 it will be good to lay down like this all this 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.100
 closes here on all sides it 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:40.120
 vents the air minds for 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.400
 natural drying I looked on the Internet 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.060
 a lot of things are offered 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.720
 options dryers but they are with 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 forced drying 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.160
 over 40 degrees 60 70 degrees there 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.000
 different temperatures recommended 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:05.319
 and here it is live drying don't get lost 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.209
 what nutrients in yards we know 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.299
 that live drying is up to 40 degrees 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.100
 about well and here is exactly 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.180
 temperature will be provided though 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.390
 under a canopy though in the open air 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.430
 Here is such a dryer I took them naturally 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:29.640
 two pieces to myself and olga nikolaevna 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:33.880
 an artist like this 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:39.459
 the only difference is that there is a left 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.680
 rejected and here right but what she 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.359
 Will choose this already what and more 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.450
 enjoy and moment in case there 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.680
 bad weather or when the sun is not like that 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 saturated dim can be connected here 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.739
 fan heater somewhere near to put 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.170
 send to the dryer this 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.230
 then it all aired and well 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.890
 will dry out 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.890
 all inside 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:25.490
 here is another such feature if 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.100
 need to cover from the weather just fine 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.100
 Alpine hive cover fits 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.690
 the result with whether it is drizzling there 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.050
 can cover and let stand 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.220
 if too bad weather and big daughter of course 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.760
 need to hide all this 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:55.810
 somewhere under a canopy not get wet and collected 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.810
 normal drying 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:06.370
 all the best for today the topic is exhausted 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.370
 goodbye
