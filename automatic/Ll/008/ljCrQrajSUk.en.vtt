probably<00:00:47.700> can't<00:00:47.940> set<00:00:48.180> very<00:00:48.390> good<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.719> camera

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
probably can't set very good on camera

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
probably can't set very good on camera
but<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> has<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:52.430> readings<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.789> for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
but it has all the readings on it for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.650 
but it has all the readings on it for
each<00:00:54.480> bubble<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.350> each<00:00:56.010> tablet<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
each bubble or each tablet in there that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
each bubble or each tablet in there that
floats<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:59.719> but<00:01:00.719> we'll<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.050> ahead<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.350> check

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
floats like but we'll go ahead and check

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
floats like but we'll go ahead and check
it<00:01:02.280> always<00:01:03.000> make<00:01:03.239> sure<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.600> engines<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.470> hot

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
it always make sure your engines not hot

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.170 
it always make sure your engines not hot
when<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.220> doing<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.000> way<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
when you're doing this that way you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.690 
when you're doing this that way you
don't<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.570> burnt<00:01:09.950> take<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.159> radiator<00:01:11.580> cap

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
don't get burnt take your radiator cap

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:39.660 
don't get burnt take your radiator cap
off<00:01:15.380> stick<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.220> tube<00:01:17.549> down<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:18.000> there

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:56.430 

and<00:01:41.010> with<00:01:42.010> four<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.520> them<00:01:42.700> floating<00:01:43.150> here

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.610 

I<00:01:56.500> mean<00:01:57.190> with<00:01:57.370> five<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.850> them<00:01:58.000> floatin<00:01:58.620> it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
I mean with five of them floatin it's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.480 
I mean with five of them floatin it's
good<00:02:00.040> -<00:02:02.130> 34<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.340> looks<00:02:03.550> like<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.010> coolants

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
good - 34 it looks like so the coolants

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.150 
good - 34 it looks like so the coolants
really<00:02:06.880> good<00:02:07.120> if<00:02:07.630> all<00:02:08.020> five<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.410> them<00:02:08.770> I<00:02:08.830> mean

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
really good if all five of them I mean

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.890 
really good if all five of them I mean
all<00:02:09.340> six<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.790> them<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.090> floating<00:02:10.510> that<00:02:10.630> means

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
all six of them was floating that means

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.230 
all six of them was floating that means
you<00:02:11.080> probably<00:02:11.260> got<00:02:11.590> too<00:02:12.550> much<00:02:12.730> straight

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
you probably got too much straight

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.080 
you probably got too much straight
antifreeze<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.110> here<00:02:14.320> or<00:02:14.470> deck<00:02:14.740> school<00:02:15.130> so

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
antifreeze in here or deck school so

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.460 
antifreeze in here or deck school so
you'd<00:02:16.330> want<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.660> drain<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> little<00:02:17.050> put<00:02:17.440> a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you'd want to drain a little put a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.620 
you'd want to drain a little put a
little<00:02:17.710> bit<00:02:17.860> water<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.970> because<00:02:19.300> if<00:02:19.510> you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
little bit water in it because if you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.530 
little bit water in it because if you
have<00:02:19.780> straight<00:02:20.400> antifreeze<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:22.300> not

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
have straight antifreeze and it's not

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.720 
have straight antifreeze and it's not
mixed<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.700> good<00:02:25.000> either<00:02:25.210> so<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:27.490> kind

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
mixed it's not good either so you kind

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.690 
mixed it's not good either so you kind
of<00:02:27.820> want<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:28.060> 5050<00:02:29.020> or<00:02:29.580> somewhere<00:02:30.580> around

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
of want it 5050 or somewhere around

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.290 
of want it 5050 or somewhere around
there<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:32.020> 50/50<00:02:32.890> blend<00:02:33.240> would<00:02:34.240> be<00:02:34.420> good<00:02:34.860> but

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
there of a 50/50 blend would be good but

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.700 
there of a 50/50 blend would be good but
this<00:02:37.300> one<00:02:37.360> checks<00:02:37.810> out<00:02:37.990> good<00:02:38.230> after<00:02:38.560> you're

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
this one checks out good after you're

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.650 
this one checks out good after you're
done<00:02:38.890> with<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.250> go<00:02:39.730> ahead<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.060> squeeze<00:02:40.450> your

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
done with that go ahead and squeeze your

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.610 
done with that go ahead and squeeze your
antifreeze<00:02:41.440> back<00:02:42.040> into<00:02:42.460> your<00:02:42.640> radiator<00:02:46.620> this

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
antifreeze back into your radiator this
