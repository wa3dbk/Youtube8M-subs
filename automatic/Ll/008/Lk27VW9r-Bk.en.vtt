is mounted in the tell'em receiver here
so<00:04:27.280> again<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.699> that<00:04:28.479> whole<00:04:28.659> unit<00:04:29.020> just

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
so again that that whole unit just

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.520 
so again that that whole unit just
removes<00:04:29.560> goes<00:04:30.430> away<00:04:30.669> nice<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.090> clean<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:31.539> I

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
removes goes away nice and clean and I

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.879 
removes goes away nice and clean and I
can<00:04:32.740> simply<00:04:33.099> unplug<00:04:33.940> my<00:04:34.320> USB<00:04:35.320> when<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:35.770> not

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
can simply unplug my USB when it's not

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.360 
can simply unplug my USB when it's not
in<00:04:35.979> use<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:37.380> fold<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.470> whole<00:04:38.590> thing<00:04:38.650> up<00:04:38.949> nice

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
in use and fold the whole thing up nice

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.700 
in use and fold the whole thing up nice
and<00:04:39.610> clean<00:04:39.789> I've<00:04:40.539> got<00:04:40.720> another<00:04:40.930> port<00:04:41.259> here<00:04:41.500> on

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
and clean I've got another port here on

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.399 
and clean I've got another port here on
the<00:04:42.009> right<00:04:42.580> side<00:04:42.849> which<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.150> 12<00:04:43.479> volt<00:04:43.720> so

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
the right side which is a 12 volt so

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.129 
the right side which is a 12 volt so
again<00:04:45.090> any-any<00:04:46.090> 12<00:04:46.389> volt<00:04:46.539> application<00:04:47.050> I've

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
again any-any 12 volt application I've

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.710 
again any-any 12 volt application I've
just<00:04:47.259> got<00:04:47.409> a<00:04:47.440> standard<00:04:47.680> down<00:04:48.389> power<00:04:49.389> adapter

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
just got a standard down power adapter

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.899 
just got a standard down power adapter
here<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:50.050> one<00:04:50.199> for<00:04:50.440> a<00:04:50.470> small<00:04:51.009> GPS<00:04:51.490> unit<00:04:51.789> but

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
here this one for a small GPS unit but

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.730 
here this one for a small GPS unit but
again<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.210> can<00:04:52.360> just<00:04:52.389> plug<00:04:52.659> that<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.139> away<00:04:53.710> I

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
again I can just plug that in and away I

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.710 
again I can just plug that in and away I
go<00:04:53.919> with<00:04:54.099> my<00:04:54.250> my<00:04:54.789> 12<00:04:55.120> volt<00:04:55.300> pair<00:04:55.509> and<00:04:55.659> that

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
go with my my 12 volt pair and that

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.839 
go with my my 12 volt pair and that
application<00:04:55.900> as<00:04:56.349> well<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:57.190> really<00:04:57.219> with<00:04:57.729> the

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
application as well so really with the

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.540 
application as well so really with the
one<00:04:58.000> receiver<00:04:58.440> what<00:04:59.440> you're<00:04:59.590> getting<00:04:59.889> you're

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
one receiver what you're getting you're

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.580 
one receiver what you're getting you're
getting<00:05:00.580> your<00:05:00.909> data<00:05:01.090> again<00:05:01.900> your<00:05:02.050> power<00:05:02.320> and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
getting your data again your power and

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.510 
getting your data again your power and
then<00:05:02.889> you're<00:05:02.979> getting<00:05:03.159> your<00:05:03.250> mounting

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
then you're getting your mounting

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.830 
then you're getting your mounting
solution<00:05:03.669> so<00:05:04.120> it's<00:05:04.240> effectively<00:05:04.750> every

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
solution so it's effectively every

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.530 
solution so it's effectively every
connection<00:05:05.320> you<00:05:05.409> need
