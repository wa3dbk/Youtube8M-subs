00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.160 
and that's what makes them really stick
with<00:04:31.490> me<00:04:31.700> but<00:04:31.880> even<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.150> less<00:04:32.330> wordy<00:04:32.720> moments

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
with me but even the less wordy moments

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.800 
with me but even the less wordy moments
on<00:04:33.290> this<00:04:33.410> LP<00:04:33.730> still<00:04:34.730> come<00:04:35.090> off<00:04:35.180> really<00:04:35.540> great

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
on this LP still come off really great

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.770 
on this LP still come off really great
to<00:04:35.960> me<00:04:36.080> because<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.590> sound<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.940> riffs<00:04:38.330> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
to me because the sound the riffs and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.860 
to me because the sound the riffs and
the<00:04:39.260> energy<00:04:39.830> are<00:04:40.160> all<00:04:40.430> high<00:04:41.090> quality<00:04:41.660> because

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
the energy are all high quality because

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.260 
the energy are all high quality because
this<00:04:42.260> thing<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.440> a<00:04:42.560> thrash<00:04:42.950> crossover<00:04:43.880> record

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
this thing is a thrash crossover record

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.680 
this thing is a thrash crossover record
it's<00:04:44.930> more<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.860> focus<00:04:46.340> on<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.520> grooves<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
it's more of a focus on the grooves the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.410 
it's more of a focus on the grooves the
breakdowns<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.740> momentum<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.550> these<00:04:50.030> songs

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
breakdowns the momentum of these songs

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.020 
breakdowns the momentum of these songs
not<00:04:50.900> really<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.860> flashing<00:04:52.520> musicianship

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
not really the the flashing musicianship

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.210 
not really the the flashing musicianship
that<00:04:53.270> may<00:04:53.600> pull<00:04:53.900> some<00:04:54.200> metal<00:04:54.500> fans<00:04:54.770> into<00:04:55.100> their

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
that may pull some metal fans into their

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.280 
that may pull some metal fans into their
favorite<00:04:55.550> thrash<00:04:55.850> albums<00:04:56.420> but<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:56.870> will<00:04:57.080> say

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
favorite thrash albums but I will say

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.870 
favorite thrash albums but I will say
these<00:04:57.470> guys<00:04:57.530> are<00:04:57.740> not<00:04:58.010> as<00:04:58.160> punked<00:04:58.550> out<00:04:58.640> as<00:04:58.850> a

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
these guys are not as punked out as a

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.510 
these guys are not as punked out as a
lot<00:04:59.060> of<00:04:59.180> crossover<00:04:59.780> acts<00:04:59.990> maybe<00:05:00.680> because

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
lot of crossover acts maybe because

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.580 
lot of crossover acts maybe because
there<00:05:01.790> are<00:05:01.880> some<00:05:02.060> spots<00:05:02.300> on<00:05:02.570> here<00:05:02.810> where<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.260> do

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
there are some spots on here where I do

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.590 
there are some spots on here where I do
notice<00:05:03.980> some<00:05:04.130> nice<00:05:04.280> guitar<00:05:04.550> solos<00:05:05.150> even<00:05:05.510> if

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
notice some nice guitar solos even if

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.300 
notice some nice guitar solos even if
they're<00:05:05.750> short<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.320> noticed<00:05:06.950> some<00:05:07.040> key<00:05:07.280> changes

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
they're short I noticed some key changes

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.150 
they're short I noticed some key changes
and<00:05:08.180> some<00:05:08.390> harmonious<00:05:08.960> guitar<00:05:09.410> layering<00:05:09.950> that

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
and some harmonious guitar layering that

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.190 
and some harmonious guitar layering that
I<00:05:10.370> think<00:05:10.850> a<00:05:10.910> more<00:05:11.030> punked<00:05:11.450> out<00:05:11.570> band<00:05:11.870> would

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
I think a more punked out band would

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.230 
I think a more punked out band would
would<00:05:12.470> avoid<00:05:12.800> and<00:05:13.160> even<00:05:13.670> though<00:05:13.760> toxic

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
would avoid and even though toxic

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.330 
would avoid and even though toxic
Holocaust<00:05:14.750> doesn't<00:05:15.230> change<00:05:15.470> it<00:05:15.650> up<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.830> lot<00:05:16.070> on

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
Holocaust doesn't change it up a lot on

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.670 
Holocaust doesn't change it up a lot on
this<00:05:16.880> album<00:05:17.090> it's<00:05:17.720> not<00:05:17.990> like<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:18.260> really<00:05:18.290> need

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
this album it's not like I really need

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.980 
this album it's not like I really need
them<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:19.070> this<00:05:19.280> thing<00:05:19.490> only<00:05:19.610> lasts<00:05:20.090> 33<00:05:20.630> minutes

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
them to this thing only lasts 33 minutes

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.620 
them to this thing only lasts 33 minutes
I<00:05:21.260> only<00:05:21.410> have<00:05:21.590> 10<00:05:21.830> tracks<00:05:22.220> it's<00:05:22.669> a<00:05:23.030> nice<00:05:23.240> quick

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
I only have 10 tracks it's a nice quick

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.190 
I only have 10 tracks it's a nice quick
shot<00:05:24.020> of<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:26.060> album<00:05:26.330> definitely<00:05:26.900> serves

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
shot of and this album definitely serves

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.880 
shot of and this album definitely serves
as<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.560> nice<00:05:28.150> modern<00:05:29.150> middle<00:05:29.540> ground<00:05:29.870> that<00:05:30.590> I

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
as a nice modern middle ground that I

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.280 
as a nice modern middle ground that I
think<00:05:31.250> metal<00:05:31.730> fans<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.419> Punk<00:05:32.720> fans<00:05:33.020> can

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
think metal fans and Punk fans can

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.140 
think metal fans and Punk fans can
approach<00:05:33.590> with<00:05:33.800> excitement<00:05:34.460> I'm<00:05:34.580> feeling<00:05:35.060> a
