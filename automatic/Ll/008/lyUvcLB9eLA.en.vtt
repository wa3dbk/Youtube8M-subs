00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.880
 then he is a studious and download one 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.280

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.400
 we want and then yes then 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.130
 so do not let me download 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.130
 it's not that someone is a little too general 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.250
 good has wanted to appear here the image 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.830

 that is for the few know if in 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.670
 There will be few of us who have the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.560
 pmp 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.980

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.600
 sincerely here very many variety of 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
 games 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.150
 I started the good tutorial here there is artist 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.790
 and more variety of game boy games 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.640
 advance 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.230
 very good 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.230
 although there are some that 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.260
 that is, if you do not download them when you download them 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.930
 but most of them work if by 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.090
 there three of those of all those who 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.470
 downloaded the memo then works the 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.470
 page is well reliable 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.170
 but here you can come to look at casting a 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 look for each of the letters to 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.010
 see some game for example here is a 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.010
 latte 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.129
 here is good 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:25.360
 the american american well 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.360
 There are several 2.0 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.260
 good abertis imos different games 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.370
 varied for the idea 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.830
 and then that seems very good to me 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.080
 page 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.960
 to download your different games to 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.050
 see let's see what games there are of the super 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.050
 Nintendo 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:57.040
 mortal kombat 3 and super metroid 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.040
 the download is being delayed 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.199
 how much to the video 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.199
 four minutes 57 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.480
 and good to see to have more downloads 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.480
 of the super mario world 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.720
 very 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.600
 aladdin against 3 killer instinct beech 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.510
 lowered then they worked harlequin in 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.390
 open 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.660
 and now they will give him alone in the east 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.980
 game because if they did this this does not 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.890
 It's good for nothing, what it's going to do is 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.530
 make him weight and good they will give him here 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.150
 in extracting in and now is that is the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.090
 folder for example I already have it in pcp 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.320
 shine card and card so I have been 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.790
 brought with him and a new folder does not 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.990
 they have to necessarily put it in 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:55.770
 folder but I like avenida lomas 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.919
 then pokÃ©mon and accept 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.260
 and wait to be charged, do not delay 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:06.380
 a lot while decompressing 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.740
 and now they are going to check your view 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:13.320
 and your folder then implement all 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.849
 I already have all good 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.209
 and 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.039
 and here is 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:22.229
 and here the game appears then 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.260
 now to disconnect the console they go to 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.530
 give him here 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.610
 in extract eject as it appears 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.180
 she 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.990
 and well this has been all for today and we 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.990
 we see in another
