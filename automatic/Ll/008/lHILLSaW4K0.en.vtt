as you want but I I think I'll leave it
at<00:01:53.050> that<00:01:53.250> mantis<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.399> little<00:01:54.580> bit<00:01:54.700> maybe<00:01:54.970> down

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
at that mantis a little bit maybe down

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.340 
at that mantis a little bit maybe down
on<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.600> edge<00:01:59.130> then<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.670> can<00:02:01.350> emphasize

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.779 
on this edge then here I can emphasize
the<00:02:02.560> shadow<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:04.600> across<00:02:05.020> there<00:02:05.319> and<00:02:05.789> then

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
the shadow that's across there and then

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.270 
the shadow that's across there and then
I<00:02:06.910> can<00:02:07.090> just<00:02:07.119> use<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> little<00:02:07.780> bit<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.319> lemon
