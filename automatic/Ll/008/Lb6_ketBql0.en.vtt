00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
station a few injuries aren't we but at

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.100 
station a few injuries aren't we but at
the<00:01:19.000> moment<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.360> think<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.630> squad's<00:01:19.900> deep

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the moment I think the squad's deep

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.050 
the moment I think the squad's deep
enough<00:01:20.350> who<00:01:20.830> stood<00:01:21.220> out<00:01:21.370> for<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.580> today

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
Oh Cormac I thought for sure I'd another

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.390 
Oh Cormac I thought for sure I'd another
good<00:01:24.700> game<00:01:24.910> but<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.690> faded<00:01:26.110> in<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.590> barely<00:01:27.220> in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
good game but we faded in the barely in

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.000 
good game but we faded in the barely in
the<00:01:27.490> second<00:01:27.820> half<00:01:27.970> I<00:01:28.120> think<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:29.680> you<00:01:29.830> make<00:01:29.980> a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
the second half I think would you make a

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.580 
the second half I think would you make a
wall<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:30.370> after<00:01:30.700> all<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.910> thought<00:01:31.590> they're

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
wall so after all I thought they're

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.260 
wall so after all I thought they're
organized<00:01:33.010> in<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> second<00:01:33.610> half<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.000> gave<00:01:34.150> us

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
organized in the second half and gave us

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.930 
organized in the second half and gave us
a<00:01:34.360> much<00:01:34.480> harder<00:01:34.750> tougher<00:01:35.020> game<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:36.400> like<00:01:36.670> fire

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940
