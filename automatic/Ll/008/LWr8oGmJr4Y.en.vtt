greens but what we've got here is
spinach<00:02:53.660> cabbage<00:02:55.850> rutabaga<00:02:57.410> then<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.530> have

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
spinach cabbage rutabaga then we have

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.710

squash and peas and beans now notice

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.320 
squash and peas and beans now notice
what<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:04.050> did<00:03:04.170> here<00:03:04.610> this<00:03:05.610> plant<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:05.970> entirely

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330
