00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 My name is Maria Puska and his and I want 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.150
 talk to you about libraries so 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.460
 It turned out that the other day I signed up for 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.590
 library named after Lermontov 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
 is not far from my house and i 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 honestly was impressed at first 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.600
 so much so it's beautiful library 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 located in a historic building and apparently 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.109
 when repairing there they kept stucco 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.119
 some historical elements of decor 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.449
 it looks amazing 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.539
 I was especially impressed by the library hall 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 with huge beautiful stairs and hall 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.739
 the classics where there are high racks 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 flirty such a ladder to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.350
 climb to the very top and proper 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.329
 historical and stucco is just 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.570
 amazing secondly I was amazed to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.850
 how interesting are there cool 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.280
 polite people like him 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.230
 how warm and sweet is the atmosphere 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.770
 In general, there you can go with bags 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.820
 I'm not spoiled by libraries of people 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.979
 who has suffered his time from 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.250
 servers at the university my first 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.409
 the university was therefore somewhat in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.780
 shock besides 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.460
 to the library card which I 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 received attached subscription to liters 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.159
 This is an online store of electronic books. 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 can you order books in tracy 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.000
 read if you have access to the internet 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 you cannot download them because 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.930
 but to lead the library two 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.520
 weeks you are given to them 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.409
 read them later from your device 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.720
 deleted but nonetheless still I 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.130
 it seems that it is very cool besides a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 library card that I was given 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 as it turned out not to act in one 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
 libraries and in several libraries 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.189
 cities they are all indicated on it and in in 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 many other libraries will be here 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.390
 of this library card and passport 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.369
 enough to bring you to the ball 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.409
 this could also use them at all my 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.180
 Malikov's favorite for them, too, 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.450
 so I think that there it is that on the run 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.939
 and I 'll take a look. I took four in the library. 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.080
 books i want to show them to you because 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.330
 I think that when it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.850
 report on read in March, I already 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.730
 I will assign these books to the library and I will 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.740
 you wanted to show them so let's go 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.850
 two of them will not be particularly interesting for you 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.890
 and this is a copyright book 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.050
 as i'm writing now coursework 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.440
 on copyright digital age i 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.910
 decided to read become a good clothe 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.020
 right and this is what I found for myself 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.570
 grabbed dragged read home and piste and 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.430
 the second book which also seems to me 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.630
 it won't be particularly interesting for you though i 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.950
 recommend 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.410
 and it's a sin who likes to read this 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.020
 one of the volumes of works of Vladimir Propp 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.780
 morphology name historical roots 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.780
 fairy tale here itself 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.060
 considered building let's say those 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.740
 element of which consists not Russian 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.650
 only Russian fairy tale them 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.920
 I already read the meaning of symbolism 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.090
 the book is true in fragments in the first year 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.370
 now we don't need too for mine 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.570
 some interesting things and two more 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.700
 books they are both about books are in the first place 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.890
 the role of the reader umberto eco research 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.870
 on the semiotics of the text I love very much 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.300
 crack and I really like that's such and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.280
 buildings and really love umberto eco so 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.590
 here too I will read to you I tell 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.590
 that my knowledge of this book is quite a 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.370
 get rich this time is more accurate then already 3 and 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.380
 another book is 100 forbidden books i 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.390
 told in my group this wire 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.820
 a book once she got to me 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.280
 read the truth I managed to read it 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.040
 not fully explained here 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.690
 books that were banned by different 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.880
 countries for completely different reasons 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.310
 starts political ending 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:53.540
 some kind of social or just here 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:58.440
 something like that opened a gun on salman 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:02.000
 his satanic poems a lot of things like 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.040
 would both philosophy and religion and 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.209
 some artworks to me 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.540
 it seems that it will be enough 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.360
 I wonder I wonder how my 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.550
 The perception of this book has changed since 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320
 since I took her to read in the past 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.500
 once in general I really want this book myself 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.140
 on the shelf but to 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.850
 the line can not find anywhere anywhere 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.920
 part only second-hand books 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.480
 here is something we do not come across if 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.120
 I'll see you grab home 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.360
 actually this is all i wanted for you 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.040
 show and in fact I have to 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.040
 you question how things are with 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.220
 library in your city and generally your 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.070
 library relationships are visiting 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.960
 do you libraries do you take books there 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.110
 By the way, I occasionally give away some 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.620
 your library books because well 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.290
 for example, I would give 5-ku tetralogy 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.830
 twilight at me they were yes I read 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.080
 because how can I understand what is 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.730
 of these books has grown and in principle for me 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.210
 do they need any girls 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.790
 for 17 who will come to read twilight 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.590
 rejoice I gave the library all my 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.020
 tanya grotter because again i dont 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.410
 grew up and someone she probably need 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 what's not interesting to me 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.580
 do you share your books with yours 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.800
 libraries and what are your relationships 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.930
 with them tell me in the comments i 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.840
 I will be glad to talk on the topic will be very 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.940
 It is interesting to talk about this supposedly 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.669
 preying on a phenomenon like a library 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.700
 Although here on Peter I think that right 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.620
 here they bloom and smell our library 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.180
 amazingly cool and by the way they are very 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.260
 often go all sorts of cool and 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.479
 interesting events 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.310
 I'm here because you teach in the evenings 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.100
 far from everything I want to fall into but 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.479
 feel like something yes i seem 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.520
 I hope you have read these books 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.590
 until I have to 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.229
 pass it when I think to extend them 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.120
 you can also tell you about 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.120
 they may even show you these 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.710
 books generally make a vapor heading 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.150
 library regular because 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.650
 Feel feast there will often 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.540
 to visit in particular for any 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.850
 mass literature which is not 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.070
 really want to spend and read it 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:15.240
 still want to thank you very much for 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.240
 attention to all the guns until new meetings
