gigabytes of RAM and the display is very

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
gigabytes of RAM and the display is very
similar<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.180> five<00:01:36.509> inch<00:01:36.780> Super<00:01:37.290> AMOLED

similar as well five inch Super AMOLED
display<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.610> resolutions<00:01:39.240> exact<00:01:39.900> same<00:01:40.110> thing

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
display the resolutions exact same thing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.550 
display the resolutions exact same thing
1920<00:01:41.159> x<00:01:41.340> 1080<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.240> makes<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.600> both<00:01:43.110> full

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
1920 x 1080 so that makes it both full

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.569 
1920 x 1080 so that makes it both full
HD<00:01:44.040> 1080p<00:01:44.549> panels<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.340> dimensions<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
HD 1080p panels and the dimensions of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.069 
HD 1080p panels and the dimensions of
the<00:01:47.790> two<00:01:47.939> smartphones<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.600> also<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.049> same

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the two smartphones are also the same

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.139 
the two smartphones are also the same
thing<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:50.790> both<00:01:50.970> weigh<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.479> 130<00:01:52.110> grams

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
thing so they both weigh in a 130 grams

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.090 
thing so they both weigh in a 130 grams
and<00:01:54.290> they<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.799> dimensions<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.399> 130<00:01:57.000> 6.6<00:01:57.780> x

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100

galaxy s4 standard edition right now and
I'm<00:03:57.720> really<00:03:57.959> liking<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.920> galaxy<00:03:59.280> s4<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.760> know<00:03:59.820> I

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
I'm really liking the galaxy s4 I know I

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.930 
I'm really liking the galaxy s4 I know I
it's<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.019> some<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.830> icons<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.550> TouchWiz

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
it's just some of the icons and TouchWiz

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.430 
it's just some of the icons and TouchWiz
doesn't<00:04:03.360> feel<00:04:03.570> right<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.959> makes<00:04:04.110> it<00:04:04.290> look

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
doesn't feel right it makes it look

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.380 
doesn't feel right it makes it look
really<00:04:04.620> cartoony<00:04:04.980> some<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.030> features<00:04:06.209> of

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
really cartoony some of the features of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.020 
really cartoony some of the features of
features<00:04:06.720> are<00:04:07.260> gimmicky<00:04:07.800> but<00:04:07.830> then<00:04:08.220> overall

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
features are gimmicky but then overall

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.330 
features are gimmicky but then overall
I'm<00:04:09.180> really<00:04:09.480> liking<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.170> TouchWiz<00:04:10.709> UI

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
I'm really liking the TouchWiz UI

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.540 
I'm really liking the TouchWiz UI
interface<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:13.530> don't<00:04:13.739> know<00:04:13.830> if<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.160> would

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
interface and I don't know if I would

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.070 
interface and I don't know if I would
really<00:04:14.850> want<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.239> pay<00:04:15.390> an<00:04:15.480> extra<00:04:15.660> fifty

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
really want to pay an extra fifty

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.400

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
which i could probably get on my phone

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.240 
which i could probably get on my phone
if<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.690> just<00:04:21.930> unlock<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.500> and

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
if I just unlock it and

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.150 
if I just unlock it and
I<00:04:23.510> could<00:04:24.510> apply<00:04:24.720> my<00:04:24.960> own<00:04:25.140> theme<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.860> as<00:04:26.130> well

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
I could apply my own theme to it as well

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.880 
I could apply my own theme to it as well
but<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:27.030> don't<00:04:27.570> think<00:04:27.840> I'm<00:04:28.020> gonna<00:04:28.170> do<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.620> but

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
but I don't think I'm gonna do that but

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.950 
but I don't think I'm gonna do that but
that<00:04:29.430> option<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:29.880> still<00:04:30.090> out<00:04:30.450> there<00:04:30.480> if<00:04:30.840> I

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
that option is still out there if I

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.060 
that option is still out there if I
really<00:04:31.350> want<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.910> me<00:04:33.420> for<00:04:33.720> my<00:04:34.040> for<00:04:35.040> my

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
going to get the google edition of the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.670 
going to get the google edition of the
galaxy<00:04:41.130> s4<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.750> that's<00:04:42.750> why<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.470> think

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
galaxy s4 and that's why I just think

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.460 
galaxy s4 and that's why I just think
the<00:04:43.770> galaxy<00:04:44.190> s4<00:04:44.550> edition<00:04:45.480> is<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:46.020> bit<00:04:46.290> better

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
the galaxy s4 edition is a bit better

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.700 
the galaxy s4 edition is a bit better
and<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.460> price<00:04:47.760> really<00:04:48.360> does<00:04:48.570> it's<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.530> big

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
and the price really does it's a big

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.530 
and the price really does it's a big
factor<00:04:49.950> in<00:04:50.160> this<00:04:50.400> whole<00:04:50.610> deciding<00:04:51.120> factor

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540
