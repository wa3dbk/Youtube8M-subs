anyway<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.849> GDC<00:00:15.360> which<00:00:15.870> i<00:00:16.020> think<00:00:16.080> starts

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
anyway so at GDC which i think starts

tomorrow in san francisco valve has
scheduled<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.500> session<00:00:19.740> which<00:00:20.279> will<00:00:20.460> happen<00:00:20.820> on

scheduled a session which will happen on
tuesday<00:00:21.900> march<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.710> third<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.220> 3pm<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.420> look

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
tuesday march the third at 3pm so look

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
tuesday march the third at 3pm so look
at<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.350> date<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.910> third

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
at that date right it's like the third

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.169 
at that date right it's like the third
of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.080> third<00:00:28.380> at<00:00:28.710> 3pm<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:29.849> are<00:00:29.910> lots<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
of the third at 3pm there are lots of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
of the third at 3pm there are lots of
threes<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.230> internet

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
threes in this and the internet

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
threes in this and the internet
obviously<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.300> crazy<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.809> says<00:00:34.020> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
obviously is going crazy and says this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
obviously is going crazy and says this
means<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.860> half<00:00:35.550> life<00:00:35.820> 3<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.270> confirmed<00:00:36.780> on

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
means that half life 3 is confirmed on

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
means that half life 3 is confirmed on
top<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:37.920> i<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.610> actually

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
top of that which i think is actually

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
top of that which i think is actually
the<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.290> kind<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> makes<00:00:40.770> me<00:00:40.890> question

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
the thing that kind of makes me question

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.280 
the thing that kind of makes me question
whether<00:00:41.430> there's<00:00:41.730> something<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.260> a

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
whether there's something to it it is a

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
whether there's something to it it is a
session<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.430> physics<00:00:45.000> for

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
session that is all about physics for

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.139 
session that is all about physics for
programmers<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.620> remember<00:00:47.190> big<00:00:47.730> games

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
programmers and if we remember big games

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.360 
programmers and if we remember big games
in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> past<00:00:48.899> whether<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> half-life<00:00:49.920> 2

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
in the past whether it is half-life 2

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
in the past whether it is half-life 2
which<00:00:50.969> was<00:00:51.180> built<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.230> gravity

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
which was built all around the gravity

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
which was built all around the gravity
gun<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:53.160> whether<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.730> games<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.090> portal

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
gun or whether it was games like portal

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
gun or whether it was games like portal
or<00:00:54.989> portal<00:00:55.410> 2<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:56.129> obviously<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.730> all

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
or portal 2 which obviously was all

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
or portal 2 which obviously was all
about<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> portal<00:00:57.719> technique<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> seems

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
about the portal technique so it seems

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
about the portal technique so it seems
that<00:00:59.219> every<00:00:59.670> big<00:00:59.969> valve<00:01:00.300> game<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.870> built

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that every big valve game is built

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.640 
that every big valve game is built
around<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.520> big<00:01:03.210> physics<00:01:03.840> feature<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
around this one big physics feature that

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.039 
around this one big physics feature that
is<00:01:04.739> quite<00:01:05.010> new<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.309> innovative<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.750> when

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
is quite new and innovative so when

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
is quite new and innovative so when
there<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> session<00:01:07.830> hosted<00:01:08.369> by<00:01:08.850> valve<00:01:09.180> which

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
there is a session hosted by valve which

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.780 
there is a session hosted by valve which
is<00:01:09.630> about<00:01:09.810> physics<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.470> programmers<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is about physics for programmers on the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.410 
is about physics for programmers on the
third<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.360> March<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:13.140> 3pm<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.939> makes

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
third of March at 3pm it kind of makes

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
third of March at 3pm it kind of makes
sense<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.170> there<00:01:16.350> might<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.560> something<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
sense that there might be something to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.120 
sense that there might be something to
it<00:01:17.299> but<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.420> again<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.049> might<00:01:19.320> also<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.890> be

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it but then again it might also just be

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.690 
it but then again it might also just be
about<00:01:20.520> team<00:01:21.000> fortress<00:01:21.509> 3<00:01:21.810> portal<00:01:22.740> 3<00:01:22.979> left<00:01:23.490> 4

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
about team fortress 3 portal 3 left 4

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600 
about team fortress 3 portal 3 left 4
dead<00:01:23.729> 3<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.420> nothing<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.369> don't

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
dead 3 or nothing at all we just don't

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
dead 3 or nothing at all we just don't
know<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.060> point<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.780> guys<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
know at this point so guys what do you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
know at this point so guys what do you
think<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.950> think<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.240> wild

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
think do you think this is all just wild

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.910 
think do you think this is all just wild
speculation<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.710> think

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
speculation or do you actually think

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.270 
speculation or do you actually think
it's<00:01:32.430> hashtag<00:01:32.850> half<00:01:33.570> life<00:01:33.810> 3<00:01:33.840> confirmed<00:01:34.350> we've

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it's hashtag half life 3 confirmed we've

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
it's hashtag half life 3 confirmed we've
been<00:01:35.460> waiting<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.090> since<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.450> were<00:01:36.479> like

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
been waiting for this since we were like

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.840 
been waiting for this since we were like
11<00:01:36.869> years<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.100> was<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.340> half<00:01:38.520> f<00:01:38.700> 2

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
11 years I think what was to half f 2

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.560 
11 years I think what was to half f 2
was<00:01:39.030> 2004<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.650> guys<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.189> would<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.759> extremely

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
was 2004 so guys I would be extremely

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
was 2004 so guys I would be extremely
excited<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.530> either<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.310> biggest

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
excited and it's either the biggest
