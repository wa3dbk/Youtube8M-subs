actually even drop him off behind you

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.070 
actually even drop him off behind you
and<00:02:44.370> since<00:02:45.030> he<00:02:45.090> has<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> sniper<00:02:45.510> he<00:02:45.810> could<00:02:45.959> like

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and since he has a sniper he could like

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.750 
and since he has a sniper he could like
sit<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.680> pick<00:02:46.890> off<00:02:47.040> drivers<00:02:47.520> from<00:02:47.700> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
sit here and pick off drivers from a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.180 
sit here and pick off drivers from a
distance<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:49.050> then<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.320> your<00:02:49.709> team<00:02:49.920> will<00:02:50.070> get

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
distance and then you your team will get

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.560 
distance and then you your team will get
the<00:02:50.310> point<00:02:50.520> cuz<00:02:50.700> someone<00:02:51.060> else<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
the point cuz someone else is on the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.150 
the point cuz someone else is on the
mongoose<00:02:51.930> exactly<00:02:52.590> yeah<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:52.920> there's<00:02:53.070> all

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
mongoose exactly yeah so there's all

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.350 
mongoose exactly yeah so there's all
sorts<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.520> strategies<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.060> try<00:02:54.239> and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
sorts of strategies you can try and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.960 
sorts of strategies you can try and
employ<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.070> were<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.670> take<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
employ and if you were to just take the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.250 
employ and if you were to just take the
sniper<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.330> feel<00:02:57.540> like<00:02:57.630> you'd<00:02:57.780> be<00:02:57.900> pulling<00:02:58.110> a

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
sniper I feel like you'd be pulling a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.920 
sniper I feel like you'd be pulling a
