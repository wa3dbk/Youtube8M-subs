00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.670 
of protein it is also a very good source
of<00:02:25.980> calcium<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:27.120> after<00:02:27.330> adding<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.019> milk<00:02:28.200> will

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
of calcium so after adding the milk will

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.040 
of calcium so after adding the milk will
mix<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.190> well<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.030> mixture<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.630> little

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
mix this well now this mixture is little

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.500 
mix this well now this mixture is little
thin<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.830> adjust<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> thickness<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.330> this

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
thin so to adjust the thickness of this

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.860 
thin so to adjust the thickness of this
mixture<00:02:33.870> will

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
mixture will

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.509 
mixture will
some<00:02:35.530> processed<00:02:36.069> cheese<00:02:38.040> let's<00:02:39.040> make<00:02:39.340> this

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
some processed cheese let's make this

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.300 
some processed cheese let's make this
way<00:02:39.760> once<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.480> cheese<00:02:40.750> melts<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.500> sauce

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
way once the cheese melts the sauce

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.059 
way once the cheese melts the sauce
automatically<00:02:43.120> will<00:02:43.269> become<00:02:43.599> thick<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.470> you

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
automatically will become thick as you

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.449 
automatically will become thick as you
can<00:02:45.220> see<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.909> sauce<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.599> thickening<00:02:47.459> so

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
can see the sauce is thickening so

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.430 
can see the sauce is thickening so
vegetable<00:02:49.000> mixture<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.420> now<00:02:49.540> ready<00:02:49.810> let's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
vegetable mixture is now ready let's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.220 
vegetable mixture is now ready let's
switch<00:02:50.680> off<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.040> gas<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.489> keep<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:52.000> aside

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
switch off the gas and keep it aside

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.520 
switch off the gas and keep it aside
