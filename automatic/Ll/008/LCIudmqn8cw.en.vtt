00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.839
 we will try to solve one of the most common problems of machines 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.419
 of inkjet in this case let's see who how to solve it in 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:16.769
 in the machine the in the m sc the multifunctional the 58 95 cw of values 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.769
 It is one of the machines malt ceretÃ© ink 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.420
 percent and 7 the problem although it usually appears when there are percent when 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.039
 the other 100 readers get stuck 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.860
 is due to lack of use or ii due to conditions external to the machine 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.000
 this is not easy to solve the since this way they incorporate a mode of 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.100
 denver cleaning of bugs readers 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.540
 per cent the cleanliness of the readers in that it is done through bt - 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.310
 ink management 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.470
 by the way I think we could get a test print to see the status 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.780
 of the hair of the injectors to see what decides which ones were and which ones 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 I hope more go directly downstairs do the cleaning 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.520
 again in with the menu we would move to where does it get cleaned up let's go with 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.980
 otegi and we can tell you to cleanse the mind the January injector other than 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.300
 red color all 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.070
 in this case fernandez for all readers we will enter others also 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.650
 they know the art of the cleaning process at a greater distance 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.490
 ok now let's see let's print the the 3 of the pattern patten 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.420
 injectors 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.880
 and we are adapting to see if the problem is solved 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.390
 we enter another ink sensation 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.060
 and we enter proof printing 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.100
 ediles we launched a print quality impression with him 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.200
 we start 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.220
 and the brave 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.920
 disputed a little bit of time for but did not confirm the results 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.430
 In case the employer will look good, the percentage will have to be 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.380
 cleaning operation so many times until it came out correctly 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.270
 now let's see the step the pattern 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.810
 we will go that it is correct that not that not all the corresponding dots 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.710
 a huesca pillar impression that are 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.719
 the complete and correct 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.819
 then we can finish the operation i 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279
 we already have the 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.089
 the one hundred percent printer 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.549
