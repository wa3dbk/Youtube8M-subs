heat-safe and fumble in the middle that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.630 
heat-safe and fumble in the middle that
is<00:02:52.280> cooling<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.500> apu<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.220> what<00:02:55.370> you're<00:02:55.520> gonna

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
is cooling the apu so what you're gonna

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.060 
is cooling the apu so what you're gonna
notice<00:02:55.910> immediately<00:02:56.780> about<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.350> board<00:02:57.680> if

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
notice immediately about this board if

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.620 
notice immediately about this board if
you're<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.460> me<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.970> notice<00:02:59.270> these<00:02:59.420> things

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
you're like me you notice these things

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.080 
you're like me you notice these things
it's<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.470> doesn't<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.070> chipset

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
it's that it doesn't have a chipset

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.760 
it's that it doesn't have a chipset
invisible<00:03:02.870> anywhere<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.380> it

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
invisible anywhere on it

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.100 
invisible anywhere on it
so<00:03:04.340> what<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.120> means<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.840> either

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
so what that means is that either

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.930 
so what that means is that either
there's<00:03:06.560> something<00:03:06.890> under<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.370> heatsink

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
there's something under that heatsink

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.580 
there's something under that heatsink
which<00:03:08.420> there<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.780> ok<00:03:09.050> so<00:03:09.110> that's<00:03:09.320> that's

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
which there is ok so that's that's

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.620 
which there is ok so that's that's
pretty<00:03:09.740> boring<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.730> chipset<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.360> only

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
pretty boring but that chipset is only

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.840 
pretty boring but that chipset is only
handling<00:03:12.320> IO<00:03:12.680> I<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.250> tell<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.460> guys<00:03:13.610> that

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
handling IO I can tell you guys that

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.930 
handling IO I can tell you guys that
much<00:03:14.060> because<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.990> CPU<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.940> actually

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
much because the CPU is actually

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.140 
much because the CPU is actually
soldered<00:03:17.540> on<00:03:17.960> to<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.860> board<00:03:19.130> includes<00:03:20.030> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
soldered on to the board includes the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.250 
memory controller includes the GPU
include<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.670> GPU<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.990> fusion

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
include the GPU so this is fusion

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.760 
include the GPU so this is fusion
finally<00:03:27.950> here<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:29.390> fully<00:03:29.870> capable<00:03:30.200> of

finally here and is fully capable of
playing<00:03:31.130> back<00:03:31.430> HD<00:03:32.120> movies<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.870> all<00:03:33.140> of<00:03:33.350> that

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
playing back HD movies and all of that

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.560 
playing back HD movies and all of that
good<00:03:33.890> stuff<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.520> might<00:03:34.970> even<00:03:35.150> get<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.480> little

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
good stuff you might even get a little

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.750 
good stuff you might even get a little
bit<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.290> low<00:03:36.440> end<00:03:36.650> gaming<00:03:36.950> going<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.550> on<00:03:37.730> a

bit of low end gaming going on on a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.190 
bit of low end gaming going on on a
platform<00:03:38.270> like<00:03:38.330> this<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.870> that's<00:03:38.930> pretty

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
platform like this and that's pretty

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.750 
platform like this and that's pretty
cool<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:39.830> let's<00:03:39.980> start<00:03:40.160> with<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.370> overall

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
cool so let's start with the overall

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.070 
cool so let's start with the overall
layout<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.270> board<00:03:41.510> which<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.840> what<00:03:41.990> we

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
layout of the board which is what we

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440 
layout of the board which is what we
usually<00:03:42.230> do<00:03:42.590> with<00:03:42.770> motherboards<00:03:43.310> here<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.209> my

blog we've got our CPU GPU and chipset
all<00:03:47.690> under<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:49.030> massive<00:03:50.030> heatsink<00:03:50.570> massive

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
all under this massive heatsink massive

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.520 
all under this massive heatsink massive
compared<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.070> ITX<00:03:52.730> board<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.270> it's

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
compared to the ITX board that it's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.780 
compared to the ITX board that it's
taking<00:03:54.530> up<00:03:54.650> about<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.950> quarter<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.610> surface

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
taking up about a quarter of the surface

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.240 
taking up about a quarter of the surface
area<00:03:56.209> so<00:03:56.570> it's<00:03:56.690> not<00:03:56.780> really<00:03:56.990> all<00:03:57.020> that<00:03:57.140> big<00:03:57.620> but

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
area so it's not really all that big but

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.800 
area so it's not really all that big but
then<00:03:58.370> we've<00:03:58.520> got<00:03:58.730> our<00:03:58.760> 4<00:03:59.090> pin<00:03:59.240> CPU<00:03:59.480> power

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
then we've got our 4 pin CPU power

what<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> ideal<00:04:02.360> location<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.990> on<00:04:03.080> an<00:04:03.230> ITX

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
what the ideal location is on an ITX

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.050 
what the ideal location is on an ITX
board<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:03.980> let's<00:04:04.010> assume<00:04:04.400> that's<00:04:04.580> pretty<00:04:04.910> good

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
board so let's assume that's pretty good

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.510 
board so let's assume that's pretty good
and<00:04:05.720> we've<00:04:05.870> got<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.110> couple<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.709> headers<00:04:07.160> here

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
and we've got a couple of headers here

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.000 
and we've got a couple of headers here
we've<00:04:07.760> got<00:04:08.140> some<00:04:09.140> what<00:04:09.380> look<00:04:09.590> here's<00:04:09.800> to<00:04:09.920> be

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
we've got some what look here's to be

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.000 
we've got some what look here's to be
three-phase<00:04:10.610> power<00:04:10.940> design<00:04:11.300> okay<00:04:11.900> we've<00:04:12.709> got

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
three-phase power design okay we've got

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.280 
three-phase power design okay we've got
our<00:04:13.220> CPU<00:04:13.640> fan<00:04:13.910> plugged<00:04:14.270> in<00:04:14.450> via<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.750> three<00:04:15.050> pin

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.180 
our CPU fan plugged in via a three pin
fan<00:04:16.160> header<00:04:16.430> alright<00:04:17.060> we've<00:04:17.209> got<00:04:17.390> two<00:04:18.190> ddr3

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
slots up to ddr3 1066 and then we have a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.379 
slots up to ddr3 1066 and then we have a
really<00:04:25.550> density

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
really density

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.600
