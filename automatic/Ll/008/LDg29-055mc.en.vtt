00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi!! How 
are you!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.049
I'm Moro. Today I want to give you some tips to play live

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.000
I realize that some of you may be newby playing live

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and some of the tips I'm going to give you may be usefull for you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so you can avoid trubles when you play live.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Ok. The first tip I can give you when you are going to play live...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
...is about a few days before.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I recommend you to change the guitar strings one or two days before your gig.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Because it can happen too many things...

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If your strings have months.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I know people that have years with the same strings.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Strings have tha bad habit to breack when you are playing live.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I tell you from experience

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In my first concerts It happened a lot of times that my strings broke playing live.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It happened several times.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Then I learned that I have to play always with New Strings.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Obviously, if you play often with your band. One or two times a weekend or more...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It wouldn't be required you to replace your strings every time you play, because your strings will last some time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But if you play one or two times a month

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
change your strings often so you are ensured.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That's one of the tips.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Next Tip. 
The Concert Day...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's important that you check your guitar tuning before the performance...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
At least a while before.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Also when you have your set ready for your performance

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Because, it use to happen, when you Carrie your stuff...

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Your guitar gets out of tune.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Or it can happen when you have an outside concert

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In a public space

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The instrument, that you brought tuned inside the case, it can happen that it gets out of tune because of temperature changes.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So, when you have your set ready to start your performance, it's good that you check again the tuning

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Otherwise, you could play your first song out of tune, and it's not good.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
There's another thing that is very important before playing live...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Is when you are checking sound. 
Sound checking is very important.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And the more important thing is that you make sure that you have good sound return.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Good sound return, not only of your instrument...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that is very important, because you have difficulties to hear your instrument...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
...you would have to play from memory...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
...and you wouldn't be comfortable.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And it's also important to have good sound return from your band mates instruments

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Because you could get lost and it could be difficult to play songs correctly.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So, it's very important when you play live.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And now, this is the most important Tip, I think...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Too many people get nervous when playing live

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So, it's very important to relax

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
There are too many techniques to avoid get nervous when you get on the stage...

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But the more important is that you relax and think as if you are playing in a rehearsal.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
That's very important.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And talking about rehearsal. It's obvious that you have to make the appropriate quantity of rehearsal sessions for your gig.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Because if you are going to play live and you haven't good rehearsals, all the mistakes that have to happen in the rehearsal will happen live.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And it's obvious that playing live is not the same that play in a rehearsal.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So, that's very important. 
It's important that you have the rehearsals required before playing live

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
