 and you 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.949
 p 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.800
 payán what if they seven kenya ask agustí is like a gesture that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.010
 in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.680
 that your comment be punished 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.870
 Balearic percent a combination of 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.850
 the finger look for the father it seems that he passed that he knows how to make the sport of which he is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.210
 East Point 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.280
 in cases of road harassment 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.600
 this 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.760
 the unknown moment the park patricians group was in 2001 and the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.720
 2002 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.340
 and there the political scene 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.060
 in an interview in the bosom of that life of our history and they are over 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.000
 manifesting finding and interlacing 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.700
 random theater and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 iii their social function of both so that what they have been asking 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.780
 what 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 Who is the one who played with what he was doing and at that moment they have reported 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 in ashura park patricians in the road 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.990
 with the arrival of aguirre said before and anievas a very strong thing that was that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.300
 to see the show 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.320
 not with a recital no pérez is doing in which will make the theater 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.550
 what a lot of people called in the public space 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.630
 a lot of very different people with very different life views with experience of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.600
 very different life if they are all summoned by 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.520
 for that rich oct - the unicaribe substitute nankin the agent that 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 generally it's not clear that in January 2010 1 I think it's 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.070
 great not 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.710
 and how he chooses can not but so much the family that there are people of all 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.090
 ages as they choose so that they can participate the show they deserve 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.340
 this 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.810
 How do you work? 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.990
 what is this 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.560
 It is complex 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.949
 all this is very simple as we always work in the square 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.010
 the plan of goals we take the hotel 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.630
 own public space 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.759
 manifest 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.919
 the Inca is indeterminate that thing added biden who risked the 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.779
 Ferris wheel in line with the territory in which these are for that reason we use 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:30.419
 the space much like trigger 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:35.510
 of dramaturgy not a concrete example because you are I do not know you take a toes 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:38.250
 landmark of square as if it were a photo I do not know 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.249
 ep a tree a bank and a road text and depending on that 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.609
 per cent is asked 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.489
 inside the group is divided into group d 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.019
 of five out of six 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.459
 and says goodbye to compose year 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.209
 in which this five actions must be read one must fall another 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.989
 person has the right to give another has to scream 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.119
 and the four have to be surprised at version 2 0 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.229
 all times they have to be you in that month in this space 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.559
 and in turn more a phrase that has to do with what one is going 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.409
 seeing that whoever wants can and there 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.019
 and then they compose it and from that that composes one takes 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.979
 in this school team sees to propose things taking another part the park 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.090
 And so we're putting together this dynamic music 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.729
 by the way an example of that 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.530
 for now we are seeing a search for 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.189
 percent that is necessary 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.739
 at the time he did not denounce interiors united plane of lan moment where 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.159
 this plague so that before a park a wasteland 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.900
 and so we come to the command is composing who carry all 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.930
 also using little of the history of the nba in particular and not all 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.879
 They knew that the one who decides if he will do it on Monday in the square 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.170
 nothing and that is a bit the dynamics with the then we actually work 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.169
 we start from the murder in space and in you 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.090
 we go back no we do not work with the past from the past 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.629
 odom we work from the present back 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.629
 what opens the process of the killed be 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.699
 an infinity of questions 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.439
 in taxco in the head of all of us because this now happens to be a square and 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.040
 because the house arrest is here 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 and not elsewhere in the west of the city 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.699
 legends of sport 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.620
 I once they chose percent and whoever speaks 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.470
 The legend says 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.939
 the madeleine girl 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.130
 the prosecutor july 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.370
 nobody else explained mejía 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.970
 but that new suit vehicle a neighbor that with instead the director does not see 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.350
 how we work current medicine what techniques the leader exist for 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.289
 to work 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.300
 and that was changing 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.610
 changing a lot over time he said came from a training 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.210
 central how 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.910
 very very academic 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.920
 this one that he has not had at all and I deeply appreciate the had in 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.920
 the bmv has been able to learn to work honestly 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.170
 in reality the public space the body is the body the image 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.689
 and the sound is what the color will tell then 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.199
 in this face decree 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.979
 is aesthetic resources that allow the other to be attracted to the 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.759
 appraisals you put would speak of sidón 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.870
 texts pardo edo 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.379
 there is so much noise pollution from so many impositions walker 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:26.660
 you can not appeal 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.200
 to that sense to the oval to the most rational little tennis to touch by 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.289
 other sides 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.510
 I do not think there's 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.300
 a technique to work in technical and theoretical terms improve net 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.630
 colon with the teachers who are here to work with the technique 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.259
 concrete where I learned 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.650
 it was with cori with fali and with ricardo is that seeing the face to face doing and 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.650
 teaching them how to do 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.490
 with joy to see you interviewed 11% in January that station and girl and I 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.020
 sad 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.559
 no then it is not the one that you have much strength and Ireland 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.439
 19 80 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.909
 no no 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:20.239
