so<00:01:45.179> much<00:01:45.390> more<00:01:45.600> intently<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.289> saying<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
so much more intently and be saying that

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.289 
so much more intently and be saying that
was<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.460> idea<00:01:48.920> they<00:01:49.920> read<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:51.179> know

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
was my idea they read on it you know

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.209 
was my idea they read on it you know
they<00:01:51.600> honor<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> other<00:01:52.679> thing<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
they honor it and the other thing I

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.080 
they honor it and the other thing I
think<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.549> happens<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
think that happens is they can see in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.609 
think that happens is they can see in
your<00:01:57.090> sermon<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> your<00:01:58.289> body

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
your sermon and actually in your body

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.739 
your sermon and actually in your body
that<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.070> text<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.549> passed<00:01:59.820> over<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:00.749 
that the text has passed over you and

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:06.050 
that the text has passed over you and
done<00:02:01.289> something<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:04.579> the<00:02:05.579> saddest

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

thing the saddest thing for me to see is

think the best way is to get everyone

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:57.230 
think the best way is to get everyone
with<00:02:48.670> you
