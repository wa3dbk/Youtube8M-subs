00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
freezing time just as she lands so I can

and<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.540> all<00:02:11.660> about<00:02:11.750> being<00:02:12.020> patient<00:02:12.290> you'll

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
and it's all about being patient you'll

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.960 
and it's all about being patient you'll
notice<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> start<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.400> fight<00:02:13.640> went<00:02:13.880> a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
notice the start of this fight went a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.339 
notice the start of this fight went a
lot<00:02:14.060> better<00:02:14.120> than<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.569> middle<00:02:14.840> section<00:02:15.200> has

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
lot better than the middle section has

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.050 
lot better than the middle section has
and<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.130> cuz<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.340> got<00:02:16.459> lucky<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.849> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and it's just cuz I got lucky with the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.910 
and it's just cuz I got lucky with the
pattern<00:02:17.360> she<00:02:17.870> decided<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.319> do<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> attack

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
pattern she decided to do the attack

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.320 
pattern she decided to do the attack
that<00:02:18.950> enables<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.580> beat<00:02:19.849> her<00:02:19.970> up<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.180> lot

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that enables you to beat her up a lot

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.290 
that enables you to beat her up a lot
and<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:22.220> only<00:02:22.250> way<00:02:22.489> you<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:22.880> her<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.090> do

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
and the only way you can get her to do

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.410 
and the only way you can get her to do
that<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.540> if<00:02:23.660> she<00:02:23.780> can't<00:02:24.050> see<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.790> could

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
that as if she can't see you and I could

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.820 
that as if she can't see you and I could
have<00:02:26.510> probably<00:02:26.630> done<00:02:26.989> this<00:02:27.140> fight<00:02:27.349> a<00:02:27.380> lot<00:02:27.650> more

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
have probably done this fight a lot more

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.199 
have probably done this fight a lot more
intelligently<00:02:28.340> cuz<00:02:28.489> right<00:02:28.640> now<00:02:28.700> she<00:02:28.880> can't

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
intelligently cuz right now she can't

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.670 
intelligently cuz right now she can't
