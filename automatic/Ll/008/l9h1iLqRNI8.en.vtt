00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.179
 in terms of form 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.039

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.160

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.860
 as unique 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.550
 but what a shame 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.390
 not so fast 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.180
 of the request we raise a euro 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.840

 many people are starting again 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.779
 then we go on the music 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.429
 the first verse we start like this 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.539
 on the same note 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.539
 after 60 euros 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.069
 and then we were just a note 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.309
 always nothing 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:24.799
 and we decapitate 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.349

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.819

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.819
