00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello everyone and welcome to one more time 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.140
 to the channel today I bring you the staple of the month 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.140
 of April 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.290
 here 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.110
 so I'm going to tell you how they were 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.760
 my readings during this month already of 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.350
 spring start if I have not counted wrong 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.849
 that can be quite probable during 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.650
 the month of April I read a total of twelve 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.029
 titles compared to the six titles 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.500
 of the previous month that has gone quite 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.880
 well we also have to take into account 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.619
 that there were enough parties and bridges 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.270
 during this month so I had 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.739
 much more time to read but hey 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.090
 Let's get to the bottom of the first of the books 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.160
 that I read during this month of April was 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.480
 Alliances tales of the full moon had 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.220
 quite afraid to start reading this 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.110
 title because it's quite extensive I've 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.000
 enjoyed each of the pages of 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.830
 I liked this novel a lot for 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.239
 nothing becomes dense reading because 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.950
 is narrated from the point of view of 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.170
 different characters that as always 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.420
 greatly speeds reading and over 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.399
 the whole story is very interesting 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.660
 addictive and totally loving the truth 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.010
 is that he has really enjoyed this 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.870
 reading I have put four stars 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.520
 over five the next book I read 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 it was eternal days that is the first part 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.420
 of the technology of the vampire queen of 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.950
 rebecca corn the first point with three 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.020
 stars about five I liked the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.729
 argument I liked the story the author 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.830
 create your own rules within the world 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.479
 Vampiric there are many flash backs which 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.610
 I love to know how it was 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.630
 the past of this protagonist without 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.790
 However, I think there are certain elements 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.500
 that are quite loose or very little 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.630
 developed in the novel and that is not 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.520
 exploited the first romantic reading 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.590
 of the month was no love without thorns the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 third of the tetralogy room 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.250
 make up something very characteristic of 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.990
 Salama novels clear is the great humor 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.120
 that his characters give off 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.700
 great comic scenes that he writes and 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.080
 everything in itself is quite fun without 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.520
 However, this novel has found a 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.380
 touch much darker much more 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.880
 vengeful and spiteful he did that from the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.740
 principle will cost me a lot, that is to say 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.690
 this is to make up from truth 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.130
 I'm reading the same technology because 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.510
 this cost me quite a lot to place me 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.090
 inside the story because it was not so 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.680
 intense so romantic or so passionate 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.600
 as is usually the stories 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.860
 This author for that reason he pointed 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.750
 four stars over five because 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.759
 Although I liked the novel very much, I think 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.979
 It has a great background and is very well 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.660
 written I think that it does not have the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.039
 essence of this author the following 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.390
 story was stolen night that is the 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.039
 Second part of the vampire queen 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.239
 famous I liked it much less than the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.320
 previous point with two stars 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.850
 about 5 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.590
 there are less plasmas relationships 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.180
 amorous between the characters are 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.620
 absolutely very little believable 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.569
 we change from night to morning as 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.890
 if we had new shoes something 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.780
 is disappointing enough of that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.280
 trilogy is that the protagonist despite 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.469
 that it was a vampire that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.209
 became human takes too many 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.249
 risks that is to say I think you do not have 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.019
 realize that it is no longer almighty that 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.090
 it is not immortal but it is a simple 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.129
 human and I think we do a lot of things 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.959
 unconsciously I think it's not something 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.790
 totally rational I would not give them a 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.290
 so great danger of seeing me submerged in 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.849
 the world of vampires without having 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.379
 no type of protection so for 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.060
 that we started to lower the score of 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.709
 that theology the efficient story was 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.129
 the sea of ​​tranquility of kasian and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.689
 law 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.819
 this book together with two stars about 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:54.159
 five was quite dramatic was very 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.780
 sad very dark one of the things maybe 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.579
 who will not enjoy this novel so much 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.590
 was the main protagonist I think that 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.419
 I have not seen a character so highly 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.689
 opposite to me in life is a character 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.709
 very cynical very dark very 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.299
 self-destructive there was a part of the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.129
 novel that was quite complicated 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.510
 to be able to continue because the truth is 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.280
 that I was not liking at all the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.599
 spin that was taking the story I think 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.459
 that the novel is interesting is good 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.719
 has a great base however I think that 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.189
 I'm not the right person to 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.389
 enjoy this kind of readings a 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.919
 of the great readings this month was 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.239
 all the wings of the kingdom of the unah of 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.889
 it arrived if you like fairies 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.150
 princesses the kingdoms and the knights 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.430
 with unfaithful destinies 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.200
 but very big this is your reading 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.879
 I really enjoyed the characters of 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.170
 the stories the transformation so 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.430
 radical that the protagonist suffers the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.870
 throughout the novel I think the author has 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.519
 included many of the elements that 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.780
 belong to the fantasy genre has 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.280
 made a great compilation of the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.420
 stories of children's stories that 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.859
 we have known throughout 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.810
 our life so it has really been 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.159
 a great great reading valued very much 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.450
 the novels in which there is a great 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.220
 progression of the characters does not 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.750
 like flat characters or not 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.670
 evolve the frames that do not have 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.079
 kilos interesting and thieves that this 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.760
 story has the whole combination 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.379
 perfect although the ending was not 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.700
 exactly how I expected the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.590
 next reading was the time between 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.239
 we wanted to start this 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.680
 biology because maya raimon had you 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.389
 recommended many times our 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.159
 books I had it with three stars about 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.079
 five because it was not exactly so 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.889
 good as I expected something that 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.750
 it happens quite often 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.760
 juvenile literature and that I do not get to 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.439
 believe me at all is the ease with what 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.879
 that the characters accept the theme of what 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.079
 paranormal and this happened especially in 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.880
 the two vampire novels that I've 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.530
 commented on this cure for and with the I 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.330
 encounter we can not accept 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.039
 with so much ease a fact 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.210
 paranormal without any doubt the best 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.410
 reading he did during the month of April 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.660
 it was andres 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.340
 skype under the eternal sky of veronica 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.780
 rossi without any doubt I think it's a 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.520
 of the big candidates for the top 10 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.960
 of the best readings of the year 2015 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.490
 is narrated from the point of view of 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.350
 the two main characters which 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.430
 speeds up reading a lot that I 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.990
 like it has surprised me at the same 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.790
 time of this novel is that the theme of 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.350
 youthful romance is not the central axis and 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.820
 principal of the plot which has made 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.800
 that they enjoy much more of the plot that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 immerse me a lot more in it and that 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.130
 I'm not so embarrassed about the relationship 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.840
 next of which I will speak to you 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.600
 belongs to the genre of romantic erotica 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.010
 and is the lover of amanda that I think is 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720
 the first novel if I'm not wrong that 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.190
 I read from this author aunts the book in my 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.840
 house thanks to the large bookshelf 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.340
 historical romantic novel that has my 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.780
 mother so I 'll venture out of this 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.740
 novel knitted against the stars 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.420
 about five I think it's the first 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.980
 novel what a little point of this 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.330
 literary genre something that has me 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.070
 very much liked the way of writing of 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.960
 this author I do not know if it is in all 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.490
 novels or only in this example is 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.290
 that I think has a way of telling 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.270
 quite music very little passionate very 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.160
 little fiery the characters are very 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.840
 very linear planes have not changed in 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.610
 a length of the whole novel and although the 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.140
 plot is interesting because it's very 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.790
 interesting I think the way of telling 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.380
 and the characters have killed a lot the 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.090
 history the sugar flour of doubles 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.540
 Garcia was another of my readings of this 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.490
 month 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.560
 it caught my attention this novel was 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.630
 which mixes what would be the development of 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.340
 the frame at the present time and which 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.840
 would be the compilation of the story in 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.400
 the past throughout the entire novel 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.900
 it has been very much noticed the great 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.280
 historic preparation that has the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.690
 author there are many historical details 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.770
 that are embodied within these 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.390
 novels and that although at the beginning 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.590
 They seem quite curious and very 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.570
 interesting because you are learning 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.400
 things at the same time you enjoy 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.140
 the novel in my case has reached a point 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.370
 of the novel was quite tedious of 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.230
 read because there was too much data 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.610
 historical many characters that 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.020
 they were appearing I think the plot 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.700
 some moments it was going a little 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.170
 blurring what I really wanted 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.790
 tell the author but good is a 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.020
 pretty interesting reading and during 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.820
 the month of April I finished the third and 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.930
 last part of the vampire queen that 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.430
 now that I 'm thinking it could have 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.140
 talked about all the books together for 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.610
 make a summary of theology and not 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.290
 separately but since I'm reading the 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.540
 through guthrie I am reading them 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.800
 as they appear, this takes 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.930
 point with three stars out of five 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.550
 I think the novel has big flaws 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.650
 still not perfect or a work 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.210
 teacher however there are certain details 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.040
 within this novel that have made 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.720
 you recover the spirit a little 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.760
 respect to the saga the good entrance 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.990
 invent new plasmas new rules 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.910
 within the vampiric world that has made 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.320
 much more interesting reading 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.210
 and I keep saying that those reactions 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.490
 typical among adolescents regarding 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.930
 to the paranormal theme are not normal no 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.370
 they are believable, enjoying the 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.570
 plot of love within this story if 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.040
 the last reading that I enjoyed 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.780
 during this month of April was the 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.040
 mystery of the carriage the corpse of a 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.690
 man found himself in the middle of the night 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.920
 inside a horse carriage already 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.510
 we will accompany the detective more 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.800
 important Melbourne to discover 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.110
 who is that man who has happened to him 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.640
 who has done that to you when I eat because 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.930
 all the big ones and they steal you detail that 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.580
 I really liked the way 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.120
 write of this author is that in several 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.370
 moments 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.960
 the author interacts with the reader himself 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.640
 that is, it is as if he were speaking to us 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.080
 directly to us to make us 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.010
 partakers of the novel and the truth that 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.700
 this is something that seems to me a detail 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.170
 very nice 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.790
 this book targeted with four stars 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.900
 over five not only because the 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.270
 editorial edition is 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.710
 wonderful is precious but because the 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.900
 star is very interesting is solved 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.280
 very well the end is perfect and I think that 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.780
 the research has gone very well 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.100
 until we got the glasses of the month 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.360
 April you had really enjoyed the 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.860
 video that you have targeted some good 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.210
