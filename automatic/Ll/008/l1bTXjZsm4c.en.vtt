 see a reference to san andreas at 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.910

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.140
 to go to this location to this store in 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.699
 jeta online I think there is also a card 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.440
 individual can say do not know not what 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.480
 check but I'm doing it in 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.550
 online you are simply going to enter this 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.620
 store like it's all ugly and in this 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.860
 where the cash register is and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.110
 all you are going to put a to the tickets 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.030
 as a lottery to those who scratch and 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.530
 they give you money if you get some 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.870
 numbers or things of that type 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.059
 let's see one that says the ventures 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.760
 as you are seeing is something quite 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.159
 simple a very small reference but 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.710
 in the game we never see as something very 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.409
 clear or we do not see something very specific 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.150
 related to the ventures and here 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.729
 we simply see a ticket that makes 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.799
 reference to this place of the gta san 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.720
 andreas and I want to take this video 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.940
 related to san andreas for 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 tell them about a particular topic 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.320
 already some months I bought the big 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.300
 auto san andreas for 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.610
 but I personally do not get used to it 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.530
 a lot to play on computer and about 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 everything I can not record very well in 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.550
 computer does not dare on the xbox and 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 it just clicks on a button and I'm 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.479
 recording and on the computer I have 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.460
 that chop to I do not know what mother then see 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.130
 that is recording the microphone I have to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 see a shitload of things then I 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.229
 makes it much easier to play things in 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 the console was thinking about downloading 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.390
 me the great car san andreas for xbox 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.790
 360 and upload some secrets to the channel 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.860
 some missions or just pass 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.170
 parts of the live game and comment on them 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.240
 logically but since it's something a bit already 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.550
 That's why I want to ask you 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 You, I, the personal, I have many 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.509
 you win the game so probably I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.729
 I will buy it anyway but 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.770
 and you decide if I upload it to the channel or 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.600
 I just play it on my own 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.729
 tell below what they think about this, do not see 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.619
 san andrÃ©s in the channel a little bit like 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.140
 Maybe it's not daily, maybe it's not very 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.209
 followed by san andreas and he could still climb 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.100
 suddenly some secretillos or 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.080
 suddenly as I was saying missions 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.030
 I know you know what I can think of 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.740
 down in the comments tell me if 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.500
 I want san andreas I do not want 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.450
 it's something like that since I see that but because I've 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.460
 listened to wonders of the game I what 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.350
 personal many of you already know 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.720
 I've never said I got to play 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.730
 I never got to spend it maybe in the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.650
 I tried a friend's house or maybe I tried it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 with someone he played for a while but in 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.090
 I never really played it like that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.040
 admire this wey is this this bully or if 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.820

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.950

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.510
