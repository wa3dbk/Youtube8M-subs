 commissioners and we thank you for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 alaska de zimmer over the years because we

 It took two years to negotiate this agreement but 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.619
 the decisive decision for the future of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.480
 this franchise and this community because 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.970

 to the county after years when it has not 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.980
 given not a single goal so we've 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 Guaranteed is that immediately 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.340
 starting next week they are going to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.760
 receive two million dollars what 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.739
 we have converted is formerly a 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.079
 form that expenses and so on 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 We are now guaranteeing a payment 2 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.059
 million this year one million all the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.410
 years in the future 25 years in addition to 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.989
 hundreds of millions of dollars that we're going 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.109
 to invest and invest in the sand that does not 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.910
 is not going to the global deposit to the 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.890
 construction this sand is from the town and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.989
 we are responsible for 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.820
 keep it in the first class there is a 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.610
 debt that last year the inspector 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 General of the county imposed on the team 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 are I think three and a half million of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 dollars you the team is going to pay that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.240
 debt 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.189
 we have reconciled that not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 was a debt were some expenses that were 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.170
 they made the sand and they have documented 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.090
 exactly pile by vila walls by 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 walls where that money went and it has 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.659
 confirmed that it is invested in the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.810
 sand 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.939
 is already paid and we do not invest in the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.829
 sand so it was a decision of the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 elector general of living from where 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.549
 they had made our expenses we 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.890
 we have confirmed with a song 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.140
 justified as in repair and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.240
 exclusively organizer a little bit 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.829
 the subsidy that I do not have very clear 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.380
 how the subsidy is going to work is 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.310
 where the subsidy comes is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.070
 it exclusively comes from money that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.600
 we generate from tourists 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.329
 that's money tourists there is no 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.670
 cent of the general fund or the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.799
 taxpayers directly or creates debt 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.990
 that there is no county debt 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.310
 that money will continue and as the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.020
 president of the commission and they are a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.610
 very interesting analysis when you 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.509
 begins to reduce the contributions that 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.030
 we 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.640
 doing in 100 subsidy for in the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.260
 years of fruit when it receives subsidy 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.480
 today the team and how much is going to 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.790
 receive from starvation today because 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.590
 we received 6.4 million dollars now 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.720
 is going to subtract from the 2 million 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.870
 dollars or a million dollars annually and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.790
 in the future it will go to 8 8.5 million 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.110
 dollars but it will also be reduced by the 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.209
 contribution that we are 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.920
 actions and that technically has lowered the 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.920
 subsidy with this decision 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.310
 until when
