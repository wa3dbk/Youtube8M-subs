00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
on like I have just learned to cast on

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.620 
on like I have just learned to cast on
this<00:00:14.619> way<00:00:14.829> because<00:00:15.459> for<00:00:15.820> years<00:00:15.940> I<00:00:16.180> was<00:00:16.420> pretty

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
this way because for years I was pretty

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.720 
this way because for years I was pretty
good<00:00:16.780> native<00:00:17.110> knitter<00:00:17.470> but<00:00:18.160> I<00:00:18.190> always<00:00:18.490> have

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
good native knitter but I always have

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.520 
good native knitter but I always have
that<00:00:18.880> someone<00:00:19.180> else<00:00:19.270> cast<00:00:19.630> on<00:00:19.900> for<00:00:20.140> me<00:00:20.290> because

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:20.530 
that someone else cast on for me because

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.440 
that someone else cast on for me because
I<00:00:20.650> just<00:00:20.710> couldn't<00:00:20.860> figure<00:00:21.220> it<00:00:21.340> out<00:00:21.460> but<00:00:22.210> I

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
I just couldn't figure it out but I

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.180 
I just couldn't figure it out but I
found<00:00:22.960> a<00:00:23.080> way<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.260> do<00:00:23.500> it<00:00:23.620> now<00:00:23.800> that<00:00:24.160> I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
found a way to do it now that I

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.870 
found a way to do it now that I
understand<00:00:25.560> i'm<00:00:26.560> using<00:00:26.770> these<00:00:27.070> huge<00:00:27.400> needles

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
thickness of beyond but just for now

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.389 
thickness of beyond but just for now
just<00:00:48.700> you<00:00:49.270> know<00:00:49.930> let's<00:00:50.800> say<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:51.040> must<00:00:51.160> wanna

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
just you know let's say you must wanna

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.800 
just you know let's say you must wanna
make<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.670> scarf<00:00:51.910> or<00:00:52.149> something<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.720> don't

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
make a scarf or something so you don't

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.900 
make a scarf or something so you don't
need<00:00:52.960> that<00:00:53.110> much<00:00:53.290> shell<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:54.309> here's<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.760> way<00:00:54.880> I

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
need that much shell so here's the way I

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.729 
need that much shell so here's the way I
do<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.649> put<00:00:57.450> this<00:00:58.450> on<00:00:58.690> like<00:00:58.899> this<00:00:59.079> actually

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
do it I put this on like this actually

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.600 
do it I put this on like this actually
it's<00:00:59.890> just<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.910> same<00:01:01.149> as<00:01:01.390> wrapping<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.610> put

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
it's just the same as wrapping so put

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.660 
it's just the same as wrapping so put
the<00:01:03.790> yarn<00:01:04.320> wrap<00:01:05.320> it<00:01:05.469> around<00:01:05.560> once<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.579> just

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
the yarn wrap it around once and just

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.090 
the yarn wrap it around once and just
hold<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.210> there<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.930> if<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.290> already<00:01:08.470> know<00:01:08.860> how

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
hold it there so if you already know how

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.940 
hold it there so if you already know how
to<00:01:09.130> knit<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.659> you'll<00:01:11.020> understand<00:01:11.560> this<00:01:11.680> part

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
to knit then you'll understand this part

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.760 
to knit then you'll understand this part
then<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.330> one<00:01:13.540> stitch<00:01:13.930> as<00:01:14.229> if<00:01:14.290> you're<00:01:14.650> at

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
then the one stitch as if you're at

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.289 
then the one stitch as if you're at
knitting<00:01:15.120> that's<00:01:16.120> it<00:01:16.420> we<00:01:17.229> did<00:01:17.440> it<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.299> there

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
knitting that's it we did it and there

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.430 
knitting that's it we did it and there
you<00:01:19.450> have<00:01:19.479> that<00:01:19.869> then<00:01:20.619> here's<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.640> long<00:01:21.940> piece

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
you have that then here's the long piece

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.310 
you have that then here's the long piece
the<00:01:23.440> not<00:01:24.369> suppress<00:01:24.729> to<00:01:24.970> touch<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.510> ball<00:01:25.659> the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
the not suppress to touch the ball the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.060 
the not suppress to touch the ball the
loose<00:01:26.830> cut<00:01:27.600> wrap<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.810> around<00:01:28.900> again<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.560> knit

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
loose cut wrap it around again and knit

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.330 
loose cut wrap it around again and knit
that<00:01:30.250> one<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.320> that's<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:32.920> simple<00:01:33.250> as

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
that one and that's it it's simple as

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.780 
that one and that's it it's simple as
that<00:01:33.570> wrap<00:01:34.570> it<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.189> knit<00:01:36.189> it<00:01:37.830> so<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.460> only

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
that wrap it and knit it so the only

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.520 
that wrap it and knit it so the only
difficulty<00:01:40.450> if<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.689> have<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.990> calculate<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
difficulty if you have to calculate the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.080 
difficulty if you have to calculate the
right<00:01:41.830> amount<00:01:42.100> of<00:01:42.189> yarn<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:42.729> you'll<00:01:42.880> have<00:01:43.030> the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
right amount of yarn so you'll have the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.719 
right amount of yarn so you'll have the
number<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.540> stitches<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:44.080> want<00:01:44.290> but<00:01:44.950> that's

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
number of stitches you want but that's

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.600 
number of stitches you want but that's
basically<00:01:46.210> your<00:01:46.630> knitting<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.310> first

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
basically your knitting on the first

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.020 
basically your knitting on the first
world<00:01:48.909> while<00:01:49.299> you're<00:01:49.570> casting<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.880> mean<00:01:51.880> I've

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
world while you're casting I mean I've

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.910 
world while you're casting I mean I've
been<00:01:52.060> explained<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.080> many<00:01:53.290> different<00:01:53.470> ways<00:01:53.650> of

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
been explained so many different ways of

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
been explained so many different ways of
casting<00:01:54.159> on

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
casting on

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.590 
casting on
I<00:01:55.000> just<00:01:55.480> can't<00:01:55.780> figure<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:56.170> out<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.890> finally

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I just can't figure it out and I finally

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.710 
I just can't figure it out and I finally
tried<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.870> way<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.350> worked<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.060> wrap<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
tried this way it worked so you wrap the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.280 
tried this way it worked so you wrap the
yarn<00:02:01.750> around<00:02:02.080> once<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:04.030> knit<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:05.170> a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
yarn around once and then knit it just a
