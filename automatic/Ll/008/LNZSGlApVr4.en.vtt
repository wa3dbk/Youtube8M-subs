00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 and so friends hello everyone with you alex and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.799
 today trim a pine-driven series under 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.150
 called block ville yes but this is something 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.570
 project under one type such as the USSR sff 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.130
 Yes, if I mean, I call it yes 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 same private project and here can 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 play is youtubera letplayer and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.119
 all that kind of thing yes that is here 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.060
 again and no plugins worth it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 worth their madof in general everything is all all 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 hardcore yes but basically what i think 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 today whether to the first series she will 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
 such a beginner we will plow the hike 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.860
 the mines well and need resources for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.629
 start also but i started playing everything here 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.129
 without shooting first because it was necessary 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.530
 somehow you have to be in the beginning of it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.840
 somehow not interested if I will you 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 show like another meal oh yeah so 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.719
 interesting but oh well in general i am now 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.489
 I want to on the need to walk around the mines filed 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.410
 be enough resources and 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 I forgot something again 5 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.359
 close to so ok do not care do not care let 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.299
 works let yes let it work a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.729
 general here are playing all sorts of different of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 play one more of all that in this spirit and 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.590
 blame links to them naturally rather 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.799
 all will be in the description and me again 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.290
 came to the phone is very bad 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.119
 on another phone so do not fall 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.500
 don't fall all norms all norms all all 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.000
 fine yes exactly yes but what what 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.240
 I still want to say I still want 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.150
 say basically everything up to 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.040
 more then nothing special and nothing to say but i 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.110
 say again today was scorching by 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.689
 the mines are so not very interesting 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.549
 series so if someone does not like walking 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.280
 on the mines and some boring series 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.799
 I advise you to turn off this video before and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 before these like to video just 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.600
 just when is it cold in general well 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.759
 let me don't know we need in general 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.340
 you need to be a good piece of iron because 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.469
 iron i have zero basically i'm guys 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 I found wool , I have a lot of wool 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.049
 so therefore everything is very good yes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.840
 very well and generally clearly knocked out 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.910
 zombie iron ingot and carrot card one 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.520
 I had one potato there 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.040
 when I appear on the spawn there is such 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.890
 to the bottom 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.930
 because potatoes to farm potatoes well I 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.950
 took there from there a pair of bent sails 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.650
 potatoes and 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.950
 burned him and ate outgoing him 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.829
 fried but from so i think well or a little 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.090
 more a little less i will leave 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.959
 it turns out for 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.970
 Well, for the company of its potatoes, and yes it is 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.709
 Well, in principle, how much coal do I have? 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.200
 I already have enough coal 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.329
 a lot I don't even know where he's from 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.969
 so much to give at all somehow very strange 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.010
 that I have so much coal and very good 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.200
 actually because coal to me 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.900
 will need a lot I plan here 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.139
 builds all sorts of huge buildings 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.019
 castles in general castles in the air all all all all 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.239
 what's all that is interesting by the way 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.209
 general caves ended the hike on this 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.889
 and this is generally not very good because 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 cave then we need to somehow 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.389
 get hold of for the first time on this 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.639
 the moment i was born only coal to coal u 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.590
 I already have a lot so this too 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.139
 it is also very good guys if he 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.989
 never superfluous happens and generally well 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.849
 all resources in minecraft they are useful 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.590
 in principle, I don’t know guys 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.569
 co-op can here i am with some kind 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.099
 flashes will do but it probably 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.769
 will be and now it will be through some sort of 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.870
 Well, for the time being 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.090
 all so while i play one while i 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.650
 I will shoot everything else with it 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.419
 that is the hunger games mini games 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.909
 also ticket light it will all be 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.409
 continue now and i have described in 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.169
 the group that I now had 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.989
 holidays I did not want to take pictures I wanted 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.359
 take a break from these shootings and so I 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.150
 I took a break and a big stuffed at 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.340
 maybe even a week longer and decided 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.040
 so rest now but it turns out 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.780
 Well, the vacation is over and everything will be 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.709
 go out normally 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.989
 series can be per day or 2 or series two 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:07.069
 of the day as it is in this 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.590
 routine basically everything else what 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.290
 still that opachki here someone visited 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.510
 i look yes here who was guys and this 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.030
 I do not know it is not very happy because 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.560
 that I don't want to date anyone here 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.630
 you Caton you some general what that 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.060
 super active because i don't have you 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.520
 i can both die so you guys 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.190
 give no good cave because 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.800
 I hardly do without the cave that 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.080
 You do a little hooves a little bit is not very 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.900
 Yes, I thought to live in this house 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.630
 In general, by he is cool and I will find a bunch 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.610
 beautiful sofa for no truth but 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.180
 for example swamp bog is also quite good 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.370
 build 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.280
 it is precisely in principle a lot 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.919
 beautiful biomes so you can settle 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.780
 all in all sixth year all you 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.600
 want to by the way opinions approached 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.600
 card i see i see i see the canyon so 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.000
 quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet somewhere 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.400
 there so so so so so so let 's 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.050
 tone die die peace die die by the way 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.310
 bones, too, pieces will come in handy 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.320
 because I never know how to breed 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.360
 farm farmer will any case 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.130
 but I will need them for 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.200
 growing here and here and here itself 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.870
 cave well I hope you don’t give 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.940
 zhelezka well, perhaps even well almazik 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.349
 Of course in the first series of diamond it 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.810
 super cool but they wo n't be sure i am and i 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.250
 I see iron before 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.840
 finally i have a piece of iron this 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.229
 very well actually because 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.000
 finally go for 1 I do not know there brackets 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.460
 take off minutes 5 probably I take off and 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.039
 the end is iron what is there by 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.860
 iron is somehow not very honest as well 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.370
 let's go here to close this 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.080
 lava because lava is not very good 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.880
 so so no not dead and not dying 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.979
 please please don't die not 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.370
 dying dying ask i ask you not 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:59.350
 die don't die don't 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.880
 I burned it and put it on the server 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.070
 guys here on the server set save 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.830
 giving therefore therefore when dying 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.260
 here that is my things and dr experience it well 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.510
 does not know and somehow unfairly but not 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.650
 I know then we'll talk on this subject should be 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:18.139
 topic because because it is not closed 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.780
 diminishes hardcore nowhere was it 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.370
 some kind of acts and swallow happened 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.820
 the fact that I burned in some catch it 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.039
 it was generally very bad 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.270
 Well, in principle, in principle, in principle, in 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.000
 Basically she basically let's now 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.979
 still take a little by the way here 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.289
 these trees are really cool 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.030
 I would probably cut it now 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.350
 myself because trees are for me in any 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.600
 case will need a lot 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.210
 I plan the general soon in general 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.340
 build farms are not firms at all 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.490
 plan you are super some 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.440
 cool castle or a house there where deputies 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.500
 will your home or general 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.900
 the house in which there will be my castle in general 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.729
 something like this yes oh well let's 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.030
 I cut this tree and we are on it 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:04.280
 finish up finish these goes this 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.139
 letplay but more precisely this series of soap with play 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.660
 of course finish and 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.389
 this this this and finish as well 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.460
 In general, I think I will shoot hungry 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:15.470
 games mini games by the way if you have 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.919
 any ideas on what's in it 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.650
 can you take off or do you want something 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.990
 so I took off write to me and were in a personal 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.760

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.490
 and on this you can finish okay guys
