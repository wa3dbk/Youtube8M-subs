hi<00:00:02.370> guys<00:00:02.990> we<00:00:03.990> want<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.200> show<00:00:04.259> you<00:00:04.410> how<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:05.420> test

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
hi guys we want to show you how to test

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.540 
hi guys we want to show you how to test
a<00:00:06.629> throttle<00:00:07.109> position<00:00:07.230> sensor<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.130> pretty

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
a throttle position sensor on pretty

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.180 
a throttle position sensor on pretty
much<00:00:08.670> any<00:00:09.300> GM<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:13.259> probably<00:00:13.469> forwards<00:00:14.099> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
much any GM so I'm probably forwards and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.709 
much any GM so I'm probably forwards and
what<00:00:14.309> not<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.670> if<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:14.940> use<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.299> three<00:00:15.540> wire

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
what not to if they use this three wire

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.070 
what not to if they use this three wire
setup<00:00:16.260> it'll<00:00:16.500> be<00:00:16.590> pretty<00:00:16.949> much<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.279> same<00:00:21.080> so

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
setup it'll be pretty much the same so

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.519 
setup it'll be pretty much the same so
what<00:00:22.170> you're<00:00:22.320> gonna<00:00:22.439> do<00:00:23.810> is<00:00:24.810> take<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.470> little

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
what you're gonna do is take this little

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.000 
what you're gonna do is take this little
rubber<00:00:25.970> grommet<00:00:26.970> piece<00:00:27.180> out<00:00:27.619> just<00:00:28.619> kind<00:00:28.859> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
rubber grommet piece out just kind of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
rubber grommet piece out just kind of
pry<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.369> back<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.990> kind<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.410> set

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
pry it back out of here and kind of set

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.139 
pry it back out of here and kind of set
it<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> side<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:34.610> so<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.760> probe

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it to the side here and so you can probe

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.850 
it to the side here and so you can probe
your<00:00:36.950> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.100> back<00:00:38.610> probe<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.059> wires<00:00:39.300> here

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
your you can back probe your wires here

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
your you can back probe your wires here
and<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.399> want<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> make<00:00:41.760> sure<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.329> not

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and you want to make sure you do not

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.420 
and you want to make sure you do not
short<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.739> blue<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
short this and this the blue and the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
short this and this the blue and the
black<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.629> short<00:00:49.320> those<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.770> could<00:00:49.920> fry

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
black do not short those you could fry

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.299 
black do not short those you could fry
your<00:00:50.309> computer<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> Africa<00:00:51.390> new<00:00:51.570> computer<00:00:52.309> but

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
your computer in Africa new computer but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.180 
your computer in Africa new computer but
this<00:00:53.550> test<00:00:53.879> tests<00:00:54.840> pretty<00:00:55.079> much<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.649> computer

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
this test tests pretty much the computer

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.959 
this test tests pretty much the computer
given<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.760> five<00:00:57.059> volts<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:59.250> also<00:00:59.430> tests

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
given this five volts and it also tests

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
given this five volts and it also tests
the<00:01:00.059> throttle<00:01:00.390> position<00:01:00.510> sensor<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.440> for

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the throttle position sensor and for

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.850 
the throttle position sensor and for
good<00:01:01.800> ground<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> first<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:07.530> want<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
good ground so so first you want to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.780 
good ground so so first you want to
probe<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.150> blue<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.979> while<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.189> key<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.610> on

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
probe the blue one while your key is on

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.260 
probe the blue one while your key is on
not<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:13.020> running<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:16.820> just<00:01:17.820> gonna<00:01:17.939> kind<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
not not running so just gonna kind of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.320 
not not running so just gonna kind of
lay<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> there<00:01:22.759> I'm<00:01:23.759> probably<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.210> gonna

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
lay that there I'm probably not gonna

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
lay that there I'm probably not gonna
get<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.780> good<00:01:25.110> accurate<00:01:25.560> reading<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
get a really good accurate reading this

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
get a really good accurate reading this
by<00:01:26.070> laying<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:26.939> have

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
by laying it there but I don't have

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.710 
by laying it there but I don't have
three<00:01:27.780> hands<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:29.210> then<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> take

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
three hands so then you want to take

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.140 
three hands so then you want to take
your<00:01:30.840> throttle<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:31.829> get<00:01:32.460> somebody<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.000> your

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
your throttle or get somebody in your

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.520 
your throttle or get somebody in your
car<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.750> move<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> gas<00:01:34.710> pedal<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:35.549> slowly

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.719 

and<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> want<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> steady

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and what you want to see is a steady

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969 
and what you want to see is a steady
increase<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> way<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.560> about<00:01:43.649> almost

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
increase all the way up to about almost

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.650 
increase all the way up to about almost
five<00:01:44.460> volts

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.470 

about<00:01:51.660> four<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.080> half<00:01:52.110> usually<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:54.330> then

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
about four and a half usually and then

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:14.369 
about four and a half usually and then
slowly<00:01:54.780> come<00:01:55.110> back<00:01:55.140> down

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.649 

and<00:02:15.379> what<00:02:15.499> you're<00:02:15.650> looking<00:02:15.769> for<00:02:16.189> is<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.659> like

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
and what you're looking for is a like

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.709 
and what you're looking for is a like
when<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.319> goes<00:02:18.469> up<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.920> maybe<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:20.120> one<00:02:20.420> bolt

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
when it goes up to maybe like one bolt

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.449 
when it goes up to maybe like one bolt
it'll<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.109> jump<00:02:21.439> down<00:02:21.650> or<00:02:21.889> something<00:02:22.159> and

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
it'll like jump down or something and

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.550 
it'll like jump down or something and
then<00:02:22.549> way<00:02:22.700> back<00:02:22.939> up<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.989> don't<00:02:24.079> want<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.379> see

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
then way back up you don't want to see

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.649 
then way back up you don't want to see
that<00:02:24.769> while<00:02:25.069> you're<00:02:25.219> steady<00:02:25.549> going<00:02:25.849> up<00:02:26.120> you

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
that while you're steady going up you

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.190 
that while you're steady going up you
want<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.900> see<00:02:27.049> just<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.349> steady<00:02:27.680> increase<00:02:29.109> and<00:02:30.109> I

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
want to see just a steady increase and I

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:39.670 
want to see just a steady increase and I
also<00:02:30.379> get<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:31.959> thing<00:02:32.959> on<00:02:33.079> ground<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:38.680> test

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
also get my thing on ground so to test

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.069 
also get my thing on ground so to test
for<00:02:39.919> the<00:02:40.159> five<00:02:40.430> bolts<00:02:40.790> coming<00:02:41.480> out<00:02:41.689> of<00:02:41.840> here

probe that one um here come on ground
and<00:02:57.829> then<00:02:59.799> well<00:03:00.939> let's<00:03:01.939> go<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.269> here<00:03:09.760> okay<00:03:12.310> we

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
and then well let's go on here okay we

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.849 
and then well let's go on here okay we
in<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.669> wrong<00:03:13.819> one<00:03:14.180> or<00:03:14.209> something<00:03:14.859> didn't

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
in the wrong one or something didn't

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:25.660 
in the wrong one or something didn't
leave<00:03:18.400> let's<00:03:19.400> try<00:03:19.699> that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:37.210 

what<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.880> world

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.030 

we're<00:03:37.760> having<00:03:38.060> technical<00:03:38.270> difficulties<00:03:39.020> oh

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.570 

there<00:03:43.040> goes<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.280> didn't<00:03:43.670> have<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:43.790> good<00:03:43.940> ground

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
there goes I didn't have a good ground

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.630 
there goes I didn't have a good ground
there<00:03:46.580> we<00:03:46.730> go<00:03:48.460> hmm

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
there we go hmm

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.790 
there we go hmm
so<00:03:50.300> there's<00:03:50.480> your<00:03:50.630> five<00:03:50.870> volt<00:03:51.170> reference

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
so there's your five volt reference

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.800 
so there's your five volt reference
signal<00:03:52.480> you're<00:03:53.480> supposed<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:55.480> supposed<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.660> be

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
signal you're supposed to supposed to be

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.310 
signal you're supposed to supposed to be
on<00:03:56.960> that<00:03:58.030> yellow<00:03:59.030> wire<00:03:59.390> there's<00:03:59.840> your<00:04:00.080> five

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
on that yellow wire there's your five

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.610 
on that yellow wire there's your five
bolts<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:04.510> that's<00:04:05.510> testing<00:04:06.020> pretty<00:04:06.290> much<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
bolts so that's testing pretty much the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.340 
bolts so that's testing pretty much the
computer<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.400> regulating<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.390> 12<00:04:08.720> volts<00:04:09.140> and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
computer is regulating this 12 volts and

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.410 
computer is regulating this 12 volts and
to<00:04:09.560> only<00:04:09.770> five<00:04:10.160> volts<00:04:10.550> and<00:04:10.670> shooting<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.210> over

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
to only five volts and shooting it over

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.020 
to only five volts and shooting it over
here<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.810> sensor<00:04:12.320> so<00:04:12.980> your<00:04:13.430> wiring<00:04:13.700> is

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
here to the sensor so your wiring is

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.960 
here to the sensor so your wiring is
good<00:04:14.270> from<00:04:14.540> point<00:04:14.810> A<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.930> point<00:04:15.080> B<00:04:15.790> pretty<00:04:16.790> much

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
good from point A to point B pretty much

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.080 
good from point A to point B pretty much
that's<00:04:17.090> what<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.450> tells<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:20.620> then<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.880> check

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
that's what that tells you then to check

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.790 
that's what that tells you then to check
for<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.390> good<00:04:24.140> ground<00:04:24.640> want<00:04:25.640> to<00:04:25.730> probe<00:04:26.800> the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
for a good ground want to probe the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.050 
for a good ground want to probe the
bottom<00:04:28.220> one<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:30.280> then<00:04:31.280> set<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.640> for

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
bottom one and then set it for

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.300 
bottom one and then set it for
continuity

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.720 

well<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.680> getting<00:04:42.680> good<00:04:42.950> ground<00:04:43.250> over<00:04:43.520> here

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
well I getting good ground over here

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:58.330 
well I getting good ground over here
again

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.340 

it'll<00:04:58.940> be<00:04:59.030> easier<00:04:59.330> with<00:04:59.510> two<00:04:59.660> pieces<00:04:59.930> block

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
it'll be easier with two pieces block

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.690 
it'll be easier with two pieces block
isn't<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.280> with<00:05:01.490> some<00:05:01.640> alligator<00:05:02.060> clips

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
isn't that with some alligator clips

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.030 
isn't that with some alligator clips
yeah<00:05:04.700> that's<00:05:05.000> still<00:05:05.240> I'm<00:05:05.390> working<00:05:05.860> yeah<00:05:06.860> that

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
yeah that's still I'm working yeah that

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.690 
yeah that's still I'm working yeah that
I<00:05:07.070> could<00:05:07.430> have<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.610> bad<00:05:07.850> round<00:05:09.730> mmm<00:05:10.790> oh<00:05:12.610> there<00:05:13.610> we

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
I could have a bad round mmm oh there we

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.530 
I could have a bad round mmm oh there we
go

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.150 

still<00:05:17.540> on<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:18.080> get<00:05:18.320> around<00:05:21.820> whoo

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
still on it to get around whoo

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.970 
still on it to get around whoo
I<00:05:24.190> may<00:05:25.120> have<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.330> ground<00:05:25.630> issue<00:05:25.870> maybe<00:05:26.260> it's

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
I may have a ground issue maybe it's

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.440 
I may have a ground issue maybe it's
kind<00:05:27.430> of<00:05:27.520> reading<00:05:27.910> a<00:05:27.970> little<00:05:28.270> bit<00:05:28.360> of

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
kind of reading a little bit of

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.030 
kind of reading a little bit of
resistance<00:05:28.990> but<00:05:29.140> not<00:05:29.320> too<00:05:29.470> much<00:05:31.560> so<00:05:32.560> that's

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
resistance but not too much so that's

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.980 
resistance but not too much so that's
pretty<00:05:33.520> much<00:05:33.610> how<00:05:33.730> you<00:05:33.910> check<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.270> total

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
pretty much how you check a total

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.300 
pretty much how you check a total
position<00:05:35.140> sensor<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:35.920> then<00:05:36.010> when<00:05:36.130> you're

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
position sensor and then when you're

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.520 
position sensor and then when you're
done<00:05:36.460> just<00:05:36.810> pull<00:05:37.810> that<00:05:37.840> out<00:05:40.410> shove<00:05:41.410> this

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
done just pull that out shove this

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.250 
done just pull that out shove this
little<00:05:41.860> piece<00:05:42.070> back<00:05:42.340> in<00:05:42.640> there<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:46.200> there<00:05:47.200> you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
little piece back in there so there you

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.550 
little piece back in there so there you
go<00:05:47.440> oh<00:05:47.680> and<00:05:48.370> also<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:50.350> check<00:05:50.590> your<00:05:51.430> signal<00:05:52.120> wire

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
go oh and also to check your signal wire

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.290 
go oh and also to check your signal wire
that<00:05:53.560> comes<00:05:53.830> out<00:05:54.100> of<00:05:54.130> here<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.700> tells<00:05:55.150> the

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
that comes out of here and tells the

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.910 
that comes out of here and tells the
computer<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:57.750> check<00:05:58.750> that<00:05:58.990> wire<00:05:59.290> you'd<00:05:59.650> have

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
computer to check that wire you'd have

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.730 
computer to check that wire you'd have
to<00:06:00.100> look<00:06:00.250> up<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.520> wiring<00:06:00.760> diagram<00:06:01.590> then<00:06:02.590> come

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
to look up a wiring diagram then come

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.410 
to look up a wiring diagram then come
over<00:06:02.950> to<00:06:03.100> your<00:06:03.190> computer<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.940> then<00:06:04.000> probe

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
over to your computer and then probe

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.600 
over to your computer and then probe
that<00:06:04.690> one<00:06:04.960> to<00:06:05.350> see<00:06:05.560> if<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:05.830> wire<00:06:06.070> from<00:06:06.340> point

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
that one to see if that wire from point

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.710 
that one to see if that wire from point
A<00:06:06.700> to<00:06:06.730> point<00:06:06.850> B<00:06:07.150> is<00:06:07.420> is<00:06:07.720> working<00:06:08.020> good<00:06:08.380> so<00:06:09.720> do

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
A to point B is is working good so do

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.650 
A to point B is is working good so do
that<00:06:10.930> you<00:06:11.080> get<00:06:11.260> a<00:06:11.320> scan<00:06:11.680> tool<00:06:11.920> and<00:06:12.430> then<00:06:12.660> do

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
that you get a scan tool and then do

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.970 
that you get a scan tool and then do
what<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:13.840> just<00:06:13.930> did<00:06:14.200> here<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.090> then<00:06:16.090> read<00:06:16.360> it

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
what I just did here and then read it

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.380 
what I just did here and then read it
and<00:06:17.980> then<00:06:18.070> that<00:06:18.280> would<00:06:18.400> tell<00:06:18.460> you<00:06:18.760> directly

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
and then that would tell you directly

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.380 
and then that would tell you directly
from<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:19.870> computer<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.670> wire<00:06:21.850> is<00:06:21.880> good

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:22.390 
from the computer that the wire is good

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.030 
from the computer that the wire is good
from<00:06:22.720> here<00:06:23.590> to<00:06:23.680> there<00:06:25.350> kind<00:06:26.350> of<00:06:26.440> confusing<00:06:26.980> a

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
from here to there kind of confusing a

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.520 
from here to there kind of confusing a
little<00:06:27.130> bit<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:29.310> yeah<00:06:31.110> there<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.170> have<00:06:32.350> it

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
little bit that yeah there you have it

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.810 
little bit that yeah there you have it
yeah<00:06:35.070> I<00:06:35.760> forgot<00:06:36.210> to<00:06:36.270> mention<00:06:36.450> that<00:06:37.820> when

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
yeah I forgot to mention that when

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.500 
yeah I forgot to mention that when
you're<00:06:38.940> checking<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.450> ground<00:06:39.750> part<00:06:40.560> of<00:06:40.680> that

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
you're checking the ground part of that

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.970 
you're checking the ground part of that
connector<00:06:42.510> make<00:06:43.260> sure<00:06:43.410> you<00:06:43.500> have<00:06:43.680> your<00:06:43.770> key

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
connector make sure you have your key

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.140 
connector make sure you have your key
off<00:06:45.560> that's<00:06:46.560> why<00:06:46.770> I<00:06:46.800> was<00:06:47.070> getting<00:06:47.250> the<00:06:47.580> mixed

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
off that's why I was getting the mixed

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.410 
off that's why I was getting the mixed
reading<00:06:48.540> so<00:06:49.730> that's<00:06:50.730> how<00:06:50.880> you<00:06:50.940> check<00:06:51.240> the

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
reading so that's how you check the

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.390 
reading so that's how you check the
ground<00:06:51.690> part<00:06:52.050> of<00:06:52.140> that<00:06:52.290> connectors<00:06:52.860> you<00:06:53.280> have

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
ground part of that connectors you have

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.760 
ground part of that connectors you have
to<00:06:53.550> have<00:06:53.640> your<00:06:53.760> key<00:06:53.970> off<00:06:54.210> and<00:06:54.600> then<00:06:55.290> go<00:06:55.590> from

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
to have your key off and then go from

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.820 
to have your key off and then go from
battery<00:06:56.190> ground<00:06:56.660> view<00:06:57.660> that<00:06:57.960> are<00:06:58.080> on<00:06:58.200> engine

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
battery ground view that are on engine

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.270 
battery ground view that are on engine
ground<00:06:59.130> it<00:06:59.340> doesn't<00:06:59.640> matter<00:06:59.820> and<00:07:00.500> then<00:07:01.500> test

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
ground it doesn't matter and then test

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.310 
ground it doesn't matter and then test
that<00:07:02.400> one<00:07:02.790> wire<00:07:03.060> and<00:07:03.390> that<00:07:03.510> connector<00:07:04.080> for

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
that one wire and that connector for

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.190 
that one wire and that connector for
ground<00:07:04.650> and<00:07:04.980> that's<00:07:05.520> for<00:07:06.210> continuity<00:07:06.630> anyway

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.200 
ground and that's for continuity anyway

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.130 
ground and that's for continuity anyway
and<00:07:07.380> that's<00:07:07.530> how<00:07:07.680> you<00:07:07.740> would<00:07:07.950> check<00:07:08.160> it<00:07:08.400> so

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140 
and that's how you would check it so

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.560 
and that's how you would check it so
yeah<00:07:10.140> my<00:07:10.440> mistake
