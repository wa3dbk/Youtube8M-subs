00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
how to build a triple piston extender

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.400 
how to build a triple piston extender
vertical<00:00:16.949> BAM<00:00:17.779> alright<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:18.960> if<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.109> saw<00:00:19.260> my

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
vertical BAM alright so if you saw my

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920 
vertical BAM alright so if you saw my
last<00:00:20.010> video<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.460> made<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> horizontal<00:00:21.600> triple

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
last video I made a horizontal triple

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470 
last video I made a horizontal triple
piston<00:00:22.260> extender<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> pain<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.449> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
piston extender and it was a pain in the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.710 
piston extender and it was a pain in the
ass<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.160> figured<00:00:26.550> I'd<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> easy<00:00:27.300> way

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
ass so I figured I'd take the easy way

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.290 
ass so I figured I'd take the easy way
out<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.289> find<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.189> works<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.550> us<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:30.090> at

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
out and find one that works for us or at

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.470 
out and find one that works for us or at
least<00:00:30.510> made<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.929> work<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.320> us<00:00:32.090> sped<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
least made it work for us sped it up a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.170 
least made it work for us sped it up a
little<00:00:33.600> bit<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.309> yeah<00:00:35.309> works<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> all

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
little bit and yeah works in all

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.340 
little bit and yeah works in all
directions

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

the<00:00:37.980> kid<00:00:38.190> uses<00:00:38.579> glowstone<00:00:39.149> dust<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> mean

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the kid uses glowstone dust I mean

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
the kid uses glowstone dust I mean
clothes<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.530> desk<00:00:40.829> glowstone<00:00:41.520> lamps<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.030> we

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
clothes on desk glowstone lamps which we

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.520 
clothes on desk glowstone lamps which we
don't<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> make<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
don't have so I have to make a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.639 
don't have so I have to make a
modification<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.520> make<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.500> but<00:00:46.500> yeah

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
modification to make that work but yeah

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.619 
modification to make that work but yeah
his<00:00:47.579> name<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.879> um<00:00:48.469> Tamir<00:00:49.469> wheat<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> honestly

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
his name is um Tamir wheat and honestly

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
his name is um Tamir wheat and honestly
he<00:00:51.960> sounds<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.320> he's<00:00:52.559> 10<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> age

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
he sounds like he's 10 and at that age

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.520 
he sounds like he's 10 and at that age
it's<00:00:54.059> hard<00:00:54.270> telling<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.809> gender<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.199> are

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it's hard telling what gender they are

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970 
it's hard telling what gender they are
so<00:00:55.860> I'll<00:00:56.579> assume<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.120> boy<00:00:57.829> sounds<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so I'll assume it's a boy sounds like a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920 
so I'll assume it's a boy sounds like a
boy<00:00:59.219> all<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.329> we're<00:01:00.480> doing<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.750> going

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
boy all right so we're doing is going

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
boy all right so we're doing is going
five<00:01:01.289> high<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.710> each<00:01:01.739> side<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.489> then

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
five high on each side and then

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.410 
five high on each side and then
alternating<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.080> redstone<00:01:04.920> torches<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
alternating the redstone torches on this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
alternating the redstone torches on this
one<00:01:06.689> we're<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.049> break<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.830> put<00:01:08.130> a

one we're gonna break this and put a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.300 
one we're gonna break this and put a
repeater<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> two<00:01:09.510> ticks<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.130> here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

we're gonna put a block just to be able

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.620 
we're gonna put a block just to be able
to<00:01:13.260> put<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.710> sticky<00:01:14.130> piston<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.700> up<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
to put a sticky piston going up and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
to put a sticky piston going up and
another<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.290> here<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:16.920> need<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.220> so

on<00:01:31.490> three<00:01:32.490> ticks<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.030> was<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> adjustment<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
on three ticks that was the adjustment I

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.770 
on three ticks that was the adjustment I
made<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> make<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> make<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.250> slightly<00:01:35.780> faster

block<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.229> repeater<00:02:07.229> going

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
block here on and then a repeater going

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.219 
block here on and then a repeater going
in<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> opposite<00:02:08.280> direction<00:02:08.899> he<00:02:09.899> uses

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in the opposite direction he uses

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.920 
in the opposite direction he uses
glowstone<00:02:10.860> lamps<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.580> we<00:02:12.000> don't<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.390> those

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
glowstone lamps and we don't have those

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.860 
glowstone lamps and we don't have those
but<00:02:13.140> science<00:02:13.709> says<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.750> powered<00:02:15.750> rail

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
but science says that a powered rail

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.220 
but science says that a powered rail
works<00:02:16.349> just<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.920> same<00:02:17.329> so<00:02:18.329> close<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.049> mean

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
works just the same so close I mean

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.130 
works just the same so close I mean
redstone<00:02:20.040> dust<00:02:20.219> there<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.719> point<00:02:21.989> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
redstone dust there and at this point I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.899 
redstone dust there and at this point I
think<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.530> are<00:02:22.650> pretty<00:02:22.859> much<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> go

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
think we are pretty much good to go

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.300 
think we are pretty much good to go
let's<00:02:24.450> put<00:02:24.689> a<00:02:24.719> block<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.709> push<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.159> and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
let's put a block for it to push up and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.959 
let's put a block for it to push up and
down<00:02:27.140> up<00:02:29.959> down<00:02:31.010> sweet<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.189> also<00:02:32.549> works<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:32.909> a

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
down up down sweet it also works with a

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:39.140 
down up down sweet it also works with a
button<00:02:35.930> awesome<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.109> this<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.459> dependent

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
button awesome and this is not dependent

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.940 
button awesome and this is not dependent
on<00:02:39.299> any<00:02:39.689> bugs<00:02:40.019> or<00:02:40.170> anything<00:02:40.379> along<00:02:40.620> those

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
on any bugs or anything along those

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.179 
on any bugs or anything along those
lines<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.549> works<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:41.909> all<00:02:42.120> directions<00:02:43.189> and

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
lines it works in all directions and

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.429 
lines it works in all directions and
yeah<00:02:44.939> I<00:02:44.970> mean<00:02:45.120> he<00:02:45.480> claims<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.230> most

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
yeah I mean he claims it is the most

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.830
