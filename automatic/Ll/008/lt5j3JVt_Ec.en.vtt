00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.310

 that we will cut into pieces or very 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.770
 big or very small so we can 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.770
 find it stumble type 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.759
 and we put out the fire and reserve the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.759
 sauce 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.829
 Now let's prepare the dough in a 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.579
 We put the glass bowl oil 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.750
 sunflower the half glass of water the middle 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.750
 glass of beer and we toss the salt 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 we mix 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.990
 we are adding the flour that we mix 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.390
 at the beginning with the help of a fork 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.800
 then we pass it to the bank where the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.800
 we will work with the tricks 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.180
 no no 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.720
 no no no 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.720
 we will have a soft and elastic mass 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.680
 ah 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.410
 we divide the dough into two and the first 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.210
 half we will extend it with the help of a 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.680
 roll on the bench that we will have 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.959
 Floured previously 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.390
 We will spread the dough on a tray 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.700
 for oven that we will have greased 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.860
 previously or we will put a paper for 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.530
 to bake 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.710
 we spread on this tomato sauce 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.380
 the amount to taste 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.660
 we try to leave a clean dough edge 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.660
 to then be able to close the coca 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.350
 we extend the other half of mass to the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.850
 that we will have removed a pinch for 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.850
 then decorate our comic 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.270
 helping us with the roll we cover the sauce 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.270
 tomato 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.299
 let's reduce the entire edge so that it is 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.299
 well closed and the relief does not come out 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.080
 with the help of a mold and extending the 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.310
 mass that we have reserved and we do the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.310
 ornaments in our mouth 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.790
 we click to steam and if 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.590
 we want to paint it with beaten egg 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.900
 we bake for about 50 minutes 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.080
 approximately 200 degrees or that is 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.080
 Golden 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.060
