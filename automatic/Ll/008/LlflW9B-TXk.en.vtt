00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
of thing that are all over the place

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
of thing that are all over the place
well<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.630> over<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
well actually not only all over the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.120 
well actually not only all over the
place<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.380> aren't<00:01:16.470> quite<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> few<00:01:16.920> rooms

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
place but there aren't quite a few rooms

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
place but there aren't quite a few rooms
basically<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.180> shoot<00:01:18.509> at<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.960> door<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.470> then

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
basically you shoot at the door and then

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.160 
basically you shoot at the door and then
the<00:01:19.710> door<00:01:19.920> opens<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> come<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.509> falls

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the door opens for it to come out falls

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
the door opens for it to come out falls
out<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.070> shoot<00:01:23.340> at<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> actual

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
out then you shoot at the actual

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
out then you shoot at the actual
extinguisher<00:01:24.750> sort<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> thing<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:26.189> yeah

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
extinguisher sort of thing and then yeah

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
extinguisher sort of thing and then yeah
the<00:01:26.729> gas<00:01:26.909> comes<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> apparently<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> gas

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the gas comes out and apparently the gas

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.460 
the gas comes out and apparently the gas
will<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.220> through<00:01:29.939> walls<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.869> guess<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.409> of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
will go through walls I guess kind of

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.460 
will go through walls I guess kind of
clinching<00:01:31.619> also<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.909> paper<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.320> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
clinching also there is paper and if you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770 
clinching also there is paper and if you
shoot<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> paper<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.729> it'll<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
shoot the paper then it'll just like

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.590 
shoot the paper then it'll just like
explode<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.000> there<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.090> quite<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> few<00:01:39.329> other

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
explode and there are quite a few other

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.649 
explode and there are quite a few other
extinguishers<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.950> find<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.659> look

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
extinguishers that you can find and look

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
extinguishers that you can find and look
at<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.860> terminal<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.430> have

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
at that just like in terminal we have

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.840

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.780 

it's<00:02:12.659> sort<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.989> weird<00:02:13.170> though<00:02:13.400> sometimes<00:02:14.400> like

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
it's sort of weird though sometimes like

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.599 
it's sort of weird though sometimes like
your<00:02:15.780> bullets<00:02:16.230> don't<00:02:16.439> really<00:02:16.859> detect<00:02:17.249> for<00:02:17.489> it

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
your bullets don't really detect for it

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.610 
your bullets don't really detect for it
it<00:02:17.819> doesn't<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.569> shopping<00:02:18.810> bag<00:02:19.049> won't<00:02:19.290> react

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it doesn't the shopping bag won't react

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.569 
it doesn't the shopping bag won't react
sometimes<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.999> kind<00:02:21.359> of<00:02:21.450> weird<00:02:22.519> some<00:02:23.519> of

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
sometimes which is kind of weird some of

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.160 
sometimes which is kind of weird some of
these<00:02:23.670> Easter<00:02:24.090> eggs<00:02:24.180> sort<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.480> things<00:02:24.659> are<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
these Easter eggs sort of things are a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.089 
these Easter eggs sort of things are a
bit<00:02:25.230> glitchy<00:02:26.030> also<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.689> bullets<00:02:28.230> cannot<00:02:28.829> go

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
bit glitchy also your bullets cannot go

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.830 
bit glitchy also your bullets cannot go
through<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.760> shopping<00:02:30.150> bags<00:02:30.359> i'm<00:02:30.629> pretty

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
through the shopping bags i'm pretty

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.229 
through the shopping bags i'm pretty
sure<00:02:31.049> or<00:02:31.409> at<00:02:31.500> least<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.920> can't<00:02:32.189> really<00:02:32.909> shoot

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
sure or at least you can't really shoot

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.979 
sure or at least you can't really shoot
one<00:02:33.989> shopping<00:02:34.439> bag<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:35.989> go

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
one shopping bag and then have it go

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.449 
one shopping bag and then have it go
have<00:02:37.500> your<00:02:37.650> bullets<00:02:37.950> go<00:02:38.069> through<00:02:38.340> that

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
have your bullets go through that

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.759 
have your bullets go through that
shopping<00:02:38.909> bag<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.329> into<00:02:40.049> another<00:02:40.169> it's

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
shopping bag and into another it's

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.330 
shopping bag and into another it's
pretty<00:02:41.129> weird<00:02:41.419> i<00:02:42.620> guess<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:43.799> shopping<00:02:44.159> bags

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
pretty weird i guess these shopping bags

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.929 
pretty weird i guess these shopping bags
are<00:02:44.969> capable<00:02:45.359> of<00:02:46.129> stopping<00:02:47.129> bullets<00:02:47.669> to

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
are capable of stopping bullets to

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.119 
are capable of stopping bullets to
degree<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.480> also<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.319> course<00:02:49.469> you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.919> knife

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
degree and also of course you can knife

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.860 
degree and also of course you can knife
the<00:02:50.310> shopping<00:02:50.669> bag<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.299> will<00:02:51.480> do<00:02:51.689> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
the shopping bag and it will do the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.709 
the shopping bag and it will do the
exact<00:02:52.290> same<00:02:52.319> thing<00:02:52.829> pretty<00:02:53.459> darn<00:02:53.699> cool<00:02:53.879> next

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:54.719 
exact same thing pretty darn cool next

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.360 
exact same thing pretty darn cool next
up<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.079> sort<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.469> glitch<00:02:55.769> little<00:02:56.189> thing

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
up and sort of a glitch little thing

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.750 
up and sort of a glitch little thing
shoot<00:02:57.239> at<00:02:57.329> this<00:02:57.480> ice<00:02:57.719> and<00:02:58.019> then<00:02:58.639> water<00:02:59.639> will

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
shoot at this ice and then water will

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.369 
shoot at this ice and then water will
just<00:02:59.939> spray<00:03:00.510> out<00:03:00.769> really<00:03:01.769> really<00:03:01.980> high<00:03:02.639> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
apparently the water is able to go

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.319 
apparently the water is able to go
through<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:07.230> countertop<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.159> that<00:03:08.669> is<00:03:08.879> pretty
