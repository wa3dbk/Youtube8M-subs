now<00:00:43.929> I'm<00:00:44.109> no<00:00:44.350> theoretical<00:00:44.829> physicist<00:00:45.609> I

now I'm no theoretical physicist I

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.549 
now I'm no theoretical physicist I
couldn't<00:00:46.210> even<00:00:46.269> spell<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.600> at<00:00:46.809> first<00:00:46.989> I<00:00:47.230> swear

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
couldn't even spell it at first I swear

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.439 
couldn't even spell it at first I swear
it<00:00:47.710> always<00:00:47.949> had<00:00:48.070> an<00:00:48.190> H<00:00:48.339> in<00:00:48.519> it<00:00:48.640> or<00:00:48.879> even<00:00:49.210> a

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
it always had an H in it or even a

it always had an H in it or even a

what<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.500> think<00:02:35.800> is<00:02:36.010> really<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.760> case<00:02:36.940> or<00:02:37.150> at

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
what I think is really the case or at

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.050 
what I think is really the case or at
least<00:02:37.360> partially<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.830> ending<00:02:39.250> st

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
least partially is that the ending st

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.780 
least partially is that the ending st
ein<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.989> much<00:02:41.379> is<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.920> more<00:02:42.069> common<00:02:42.489> ending
