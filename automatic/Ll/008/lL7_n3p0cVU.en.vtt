dough you are very kind of dry dough but
we're<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.799> there

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
we're going to want that to get in there

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:08.219 
we're going to want that to get in there
and<00:01:53.040> melt<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> cheese<00:01:53.610> first

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.630 

you<00:02:09.229> maybe<00:02:09.440> let<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.770> set<00:02:10.100> for<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.340> few<00:02:10.550> minutes

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
you maybe let that set for a few minutes

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880 
you maybe let that set for a few minutes
let<00:02:11.120> that<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.780> hot<00:02:11.959> water<00:02:11.989> kind<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.590> melt<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
let that the hot water kind of melt the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.199 
let that the hot water kind of melt the
cheese<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.190> little<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.790> then<00:02:13.880> we'll<00:02:13.970> stir

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
cheese a little bit and then we'll stir

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.309 
cheese a little bit and then we'll stir
it<00:02:14.300> up<00:02:14.420> into<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.870> dough<00:02:15.080> ball

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
it up into a dough ball

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.290 
it up into a dough ball
okay<00:02:15.530> we've<00:02:15.709> let<00:02:15.980> our<00:02:16.100> dough<00:02:16.280> set<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.850> while

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
okay we've let our dough set for a while

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.320 
okay we've let our dough set for a while
and<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.230> it's<00:02:19.220> crumbly<00:02:20.120> a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and you can see that it's it's crumbly a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.949 
and you can see that it's it's crumbly a
little<00:02:20.840> bit<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:22.580> its<00:02:22.970> moist<00:02:23.300> enough<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.810> hold

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
little bit but its moist enough to hold

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.600 
little bit but its moist enough to hold
together<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.560> picking<00:02:24.920> up<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.160> residue

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
together and it's picking up a residue

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.160 
together and it's picking up a residue
that's<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.090> bowl<00:02:26.239> that's<00:02:26.540> kind<00:02:26.989> of<00:02:27.050> how

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's in the bowl that's kind of how

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.770 
that's in the bowl that's kind of how
you<00:02:27.200> know<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:28.520> your<00:02:28.730> dough<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.030> ready<00:02:29.270> it'll

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
you know that your dough is ready it'll

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.690 
you know that your dough is ready it'll
it'll<00:02:30.319> form<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.860> little<00:02:31.069> bit<00:02:31.190> now<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.489> just

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it'll form a little bit now you're just

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.370 
it'll form a little bit now you're just
going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:31.940> kind<00:02:32.269> of<00:02:32.390> roll<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.600> into<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.080> log

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
going to I kind of roll it into a log

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.920 
going to I kind of roll it into a log
and<00:02:33.769> then<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:35.000> pinch<00:02:35.300> off<00:02:35.540> I'm<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.870> to

and then I just pinch off I'm going to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.650 
and then I just pinch off I'm going to
make<00:02:36.080> three<00:02:36.410> biscuits<00:02:36.650> out<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.130> this<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.540> I'll

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
make three biscuits out of this so I'll

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.620 
make three biscuits out of this so I'll

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
just pinch that in three places and now

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.030 
just pinch that in three places and now
you're<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:41.959> going<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.140> basically<00:02:42.350> very

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
