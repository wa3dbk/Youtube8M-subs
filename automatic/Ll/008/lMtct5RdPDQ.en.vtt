00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
which was my first video and I've

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.820 
which was my first video and I've
decided<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:23.600> do<00:00:23.810> this<00:00:24.050> because<00:00:24.289> I<00:00:24.769> have

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
decided to do this because I have

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.609 
decided to do this because I have
changed<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.460> few<00:00:25.640> things<00:00:25.880> today<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.590> when<00:00:27.590> I

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
changed a few things today and when I

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.710 
changed a few things today and when I
say<00:00:27.859> a<00:00:27.890> few<00:00:28.010> are<00:00:28.250> kind<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.550> mean<00:00:28.699> quite<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.330> lot

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
say a few are kind of mean quite a lot

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.240 
say a few are kind of mean quite a lot
of<00:00:29.810> dramatic<00:00:30.019> changes<00:00:30.920> although<00:00:31.189> you

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
of dramatic changes although you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.639

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
probably don't notice it yeah but a lot

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.549 
probably don't notice it yeah but a lot

in<00:00:39.020> pussies<00:00:39.410> run<00:00:39.680> we<00:00:40.280> have<00:00:40.399> added<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.910> whole<00:00:41.059> new

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
in pussies run we have added a whole new

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.319 
in pussies run we have added a whole new
shelf<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.110> before<00:00:42.920> he<00:00:43.129> only<00:00:43.370> had<00:00:43.550> one<00:00:44.180> that

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
shelf and before he only had one that

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.180 
shelf and before he only had one that
was<00:00:44.510> standing<00:00:44.750> up<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:45.440> was<00:00:45.559> half<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:45.980> size

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
was standing up so it was half the size

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.549 
was standing up so it was half the size
of<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:46.789> he<00:00:47.600> didn't<00:00:47.930> have<00:00:48.050> as<00:00:48.170> much<00:00:48.320> room

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
of that and he didn't have as much room

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.139 
of that and he didn't have as much room
underneath<00:00:48.860> because<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.730> bars<00:00:49.910> were

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
underneath because the bars were

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.119 
underneath because the bars were
obviously<00:00:50.480> in<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.690> way<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:50.870> he's<00:00:51.800> got<00:00:52.010> all

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
obviously in the way so he's got all

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.250 
obviously in the way so he's got all
that<00:00:52.250> room<00:00:52.430> underneath<00:00:52.730> now<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.420> he<00:00:53.870> has<00:00:53.989> got

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
that room underneath now and he has got

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.500 
that room underneath now and he has got
much<00:00:54.500> more<00:00:54.739> space<00:00:55.219> on<00:00:55.430> top<00:00:55.489> than<00:00:55.910> he<00:00:56.030> used<00:00:56.210> to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
much more space on top than he used to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.209 
much more space on top than he used to
so<00:00:57.020> I'm<00:00:57.110> really<00:00:57.260> happy<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.800> he's<00:00:57.920> got<00:00:58.100> that

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
so I'm really happy that he's got that

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.970 
so I'm really happy that he's got that
much<00:00:58.340> space<00:00:58.579> so<00:00:59.079> basically<00:01:00.079> he<00:01:00.440> can<00:01:00.590> just<00:01:00.800> jump

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
much space so basically he can just jump

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.799 
much space so basically he can just jump
up<00:01:01.160> onto<00:01:01.309> here<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.000> then<00:01:02.149> he<00:01:02.270> can<00:01:02.300> jump<00:01:02.660> him

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
up onto here and then he can jump him

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.130 
up onto here and then he can jump him
onto<00:01:03.410> there<00:01:03.559> because<00:01:04.089> we<00:01:05.089> have<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.659> one<00:01:05.960> for

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
onto there because we have this one for

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.210 
onto there because we have this one for
the<00:01:06.200> girls<00:01:06.409> which<00:01:06.710> I'll<00:01:06.830> show<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.100> a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the girls which I'll show you in a

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.280 
the girls which I'll show you in a
minute<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:07.729> he<00:01:08.299> can't<00:01:08.570> get<00:01:08.750> one<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.020> them

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
minute but he can't get one of them

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.500 
minute but he can't get one of them
because<00:01:09.680> he's<00:01:10.460> kind<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.880> little<00:01:11.119> heavier

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
because he's kind of a little heavier

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.570 
because he's kind of a little heavier
than<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.900> girls<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.830> think<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.220> best<00:01:13.430> that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
than the girls so I think it's best that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.580 
than the girls so I think it's best that
he<00:01:13.760> just<00:01:13.909> has<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.750> jump<00:01:14.930> on<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.409> then

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
he just has this to jump on and then

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.370 
he just has this to jump on and then
he'd<00:01:16.159> go<00:01:16.340> there<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.479> he<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:17.810> has<00:01:18.020> his<00:01:18.170> food

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
he'd go there so he just has his food

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.039 
he'd go there so he just has his food
bowl<00:01:18.590> as<00:01:18.920> it<00:01:19.070> normally<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:19.460> there<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.420> his

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
bowl as it normally is there and his

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.020 
bowl as it normally is there and his
water<00:01:21.259> bottle<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:21.799> has<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.220> go<00:01:22.369> here<00:01:22.400> because

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
water bottle it has to go here because

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.130 
water bottle it has to go here because
there's<00:01:23.240> nowhere<00:01:23.420> else<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.930> go

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
there's nowhere else for it to go

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.350 
there's nowhere else for it to go
because<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.340> obviously<00:01:25.759> made<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.119> wood

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
because this is obviously made of wood

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.630 
because this is obviously made of wood
and<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.170> can't<00:01:27.380> attach<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.979> unless<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:28.490> have

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
and it can't attach on unless we have

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.880 
and it can't attach on unless we have
one<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.479> these<00:01:29.570> hockey<00:01:30.049> things<00:01:30.290> which<00:01:30.590> goes<00:01:30.860> on

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
one of these hockey things which goes on

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.090 
one of these hockey things which goes on
here<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.570> only<00:01:33.110> have<00:01:33.290> one<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.500> them<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.040> I

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
here but I only have one of them so I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.230 
here but I only have one of them so I
couldn't<00:01:34.369> really<00:01:34.490> use<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:34.850> then<00:01:37.060> Thank<00:01:38.060> You

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240

update<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.009> have<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.399> share<00:01:58.579> with<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.299> this

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
update I have to share with you is this

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.749 
update I have to share with you is this
shelf<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.200> I'm<00:02:00.530> sure<00:02:01.070> you've<00:02:01.250> all<00:02:01.399> seen<00:02:01.579> it

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
shelf so I'm sure you've all seen it

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.959 
shelf so I'm sure you've all seen it
before<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:03.320> has<00:02:03.619> been<00:02:03.799> extended<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:04.850> they

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
before but it has been extended so they

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.880 
before but it has been extended so they
have<00:02:05.149> much<00:02:05.479> more<00:02:05.509> room<00:02:05.930> on<00:02:06.049> top<00:02:06.350> underneath

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
have much more room on top underneath

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.059 
have much more room on top underneath
because<00:02:07.360> before<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.630> was<00:02:08.660> just<00:02:08.929> one<00:02:09.170> grid<00:02:09.530> by

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
because before it was just one grid by

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.890 
because before it was just one grid by
like<00:02:10.489> another<00:02:10.910> grid<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.239> another<00:02:11.480> grid<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
like another grid and another grid and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.140 
like another grid and another grid and
then<00:02:12.020> this<00:02:12.290> was<00:02:12.560> just<00:02:12.709> one<00:02:12.890> grid<00:02:13.099> long<00:02:13.310> but<00:02:14.060> as

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
then this was just one grid long but as

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.890 
then this was just one grid long but as
you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.450> see

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
you can see

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.000 
you can see
cable-tied<00:02:15.470> another<00:02:16.069> grid<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.940> here<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:18.110> they

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
cable-tied another grid on here so they

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.360 
cable-tied another grid on here so they
can<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:19.459> more<00:02:19.519> room<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.709> gives<00:02:22.129> them

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
can get more room and it just gives them

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.750 
can get more room and it just gives them
like<00:02:23.330> less<00:02:23.870> wasted<00:02:24.379> spaces<00:02:24.920> over

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
like less wasted spaces over

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.119 
like less wasted spaces over
it<00:02:26.209> gives<00:02:26.420> them<00:02:26.569> less<00:02:26.810> wasted<00:02:27.260> space<00:02:27.560> because

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
it gives them less wasted space because

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.100 
it gives them less wasted space because
a<00:02:28.370> lot<00:02:28.849> of<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.000> time<00:02:29.239> they<00:02:29.480> wouldn't<00:02:29.659> use<00:02:29.810> this

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
a lot of the time they wouldn't use this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.069 
a lot of the time they wouldn't use this
gap<00:02:30.440> down<00:02:30.650> here<00:02:30.890> which<00:02:31.040> was<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> lot<00:02:31.400> bigger<00:02:31.640> and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
gap down here which was a lot bigger and

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.430 
gap down here which was a lot bigger and
so<00:02:33.079> yeah<00:02:33.290> all<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.829> have<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.129> do<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.340> cable<00:02:34.760> tie

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
so yeah all you have to do is cable tie

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.960 
so yeah all you have to do is cable tie
wherever<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.799> want<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.310> like<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:37.819> have<00:02:37.879> to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
wherever you want it like you have to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.119 
wherever you want it like you have to
adjust<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.569> size<00:02:38.659> that<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.140> want<00:02:39.379> so

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
adjust it to the size that you want so

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.699 
adjust it to the size that you want so
you<00:02:40.610> basically<00:02:41.209> just<00:02:41.510> cable<00:02:42.079> tie<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.290> halfway

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
you basically just cable tie it halfway

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.900 
you basically just cable tie it halfway
or<00:02:43.370> wherever<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.510> want<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.900> go<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.910> then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
or wherever you want it to go and then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.930 
or wherever you want it to go and then
you<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.299> attach<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.049> like<00:02:48.609> here<00:02:49.609> as<00:02:49.760> well

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
you can attach it like here as well

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.910 
you can attach it like here as well
because<00:02:50.299> we've<00:02:50.450> cable<00:02:50.870> tied<00:02:51.049> two<00:02:51.590> grids

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
because we've cable tied two grids

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.920 
because we've cable tied two grids
together<00:02:52.340> there<00:02:52.609> just<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.420> give<00:02:53.569> them<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.780> bit

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
together there just to give them a bit

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.380 
together there just to give them a bit
more<00:02:53.959> room<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.680> said<00:02:54.980> before<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:56.329> is

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
more room like I said before and this is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.180 
more room like I said before and this is
just<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.780> line<00:02:56.959> oh<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.500> was<00:02:57.530> from<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.920> floor

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
just a line oh and it was from the floor

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.819 
just a line oh and it was from the floor
so<00:02:58.329> just<00:02:59.329> leftovers<00:02:59.930> really<00:03:00.290> which<00:03:00.440> has<00:03:00.620> come

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
so just leftovers really which has come

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.800 
so just leftovers really which has come
really<00:03:01.069> useful<00:03:01.609> because<00:03:02.359> we<00:03:02.480> don't<00:03:02.629> have<00:03:02.659> to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
really useful because we don't have to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.979 
really useful because we don't have to
buy<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> coroplast<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.980> all<00:03:04.069> that<00:03:04.190> stuff<00:03:04.489> so

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
buy a coroplast and all that stuff so

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.720 
buy a coroplast and all that stuff so
yeah<00:03:05.989> I'm<00:03:06.230> really<00:03:06.709> happy<00:03:06.859> with<00:03:07.220> this<00:03:07.459> because

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
yeah I'm really happy with this because

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.680 
yeah I'm really happy with this because
it's<00:03:08.180> given<00:03:08.480> them<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:08.900> much<00:03:09.170> more<00:03:09.440> room<00:03:09.709> and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
it's given them so much more room and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.199 
it's given them so much more room and
they<00:03:11.690> just<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:12.200> way<00:03:13.040> more<00:03:13.069> places<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.819> go<00:03:13.970> now

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
they just have way more places to go now

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.750 
they just have way more places to go now
and<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.870> makes<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.799> run<00:03:15.980> just<00:03:16.220> feels<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:16.730> much

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and it makes the run just feels so much

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.050 
and it makes the run just feels so much
bigger<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:18.319> like<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.769> because<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.459> want<00:03:19.910> to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
bigger and I like that because I want to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.879 
bigger and I like that because I want to
give<00:03:20.269> them<00:03:20.480> as<00:03:20.599> much<00:03:20.750> room<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.109> possible<00:03:21.139> but

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
give them as much room as possible but

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.309 
give them as much room as possible but
sometimes<00:03:22.549> it's<00:03:23.090> more<00:03:23.239> necessary<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:24.019> work<00:03:24.169> on

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
sometimes it's more necessary to work on

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.860 
sometimes it's more necessary to work on
the<00:03:24.470> height<00:03:24.650> as<00:03:24.950> well<00:03:24.980> as<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.700> kind<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.569> length

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
the height as well as the kind of length

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.780 
the height as well as the kind of length
just<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.310> they<00:03:28.519> can<00:03:29.030> get<00:03:29.359> more<00:03:29.419> room<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:29.959> there

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
just so they can get more room in there

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.420 
just so they can get more room in there
so<00:03:31.790> up<00:03:31.910> here<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.419> a<00:03:32.450> hay<00:03:32.780> rack<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.430> they

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
so up here we have a hay rack and they

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.490 
so up here we have a hay rack and they
don't<00:03:34.879> really<00:03:35.359> use<00:03:35.569> this<00:03:35.750> yet<00:03:35.989> because<00:03:36.260> only

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
don't really use this yet because only

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.770 
don't really use this yet because only
two<00:03:36.650> guinea<00:03:36.950> pigs<00:03:37.190> have<00:03:37.400> been<00:03:37.430> up<00:03:37.700> here<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.180> the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
two guinea pigs have been up here in the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.440 
two guinea pigs have been up here in the
time<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.230> we've<00:03:39.319> had<00:03:39.349> it<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.709> which<00:03:40.010> was

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
time that we've had it up which was

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.059 
time that we've had it up which was
since<00:03:41.919> yesterday<00:03:42.919> I<00:03:42.950> think<00:03:43.419> yeah<00:03:44.419> yesterday

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
since yesterday I think yeah yesterday

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.369 
since yesterday I think yeah yesterday
and<00:03:46.069> it's<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.579> lot<00:03:46.699> of<00:03:46.730> squeaking<00:03:47.150> going<00:03:47.569> on<00:03:47.690> and

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
and it's a lot of squeaking going on and

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.869 
and it's a lot of squeaking going on and
that<00:03:48.500> always<00:03:48.709> happens<00:03:49.069> in<00:03:49.160> my<00:03:49.280> videos<00:03:49.639> it's

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
that always happens in my videos it's

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
but it's very cute so this is just a

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.930 
but it's very cute so this is just a
dust<00:03:55.669> free<00:03:55.790> hay<00:03:56.060> which<00:03:56.389> is<00:03:57.459> really<00:03:58.459> great<00:03:58.699> and

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
dust free hay which is really great and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.129 
dust free hay which is really great and
they<00:03:59.030> love<00:03:59.209> that<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.660> that's<00:03:59.810> just<00:03:59.900> the

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
they love that and that's just the

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.379 
they love that and that's just the
meadow<00:04:00.410> version<00:04:01.099> or<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:01.430> know<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.120> soft

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
meadow version or just know it's a soft

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.330 
meadow version or just know it's a soft
I<00:04:02.569> think<00:04:02.780> those<00:04:03.440> are<00:04:03.650> different<00:04:04.010> types<00:04:04.220> you

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
I think those are different types you

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.110 
I think those are different types you
can<00:04:04.519> get<00:04:04.730> but<00:04:04.910> we<00:04:05.209> prefer<00:04:05.419> the<00:04:05.989> soft<00:04:06.530> because

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
can get but we prefer the soft because

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.030 
can get but we prefer the soft because
you're<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.389> with<00:04:08.599> we<00:04:08.930> tried<00:04:09.199> like<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:09.859> had

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
you're the one with we tried like it had

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.970 
you're the one with we tried like it had
loads<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.400> rocks<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.030> sticks<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.980> small

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.860 
loads of rocks and sticks and small
branches<00:04:13.160> in<00:04:13.639> it<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:13.940> we<00:04:14.150> decided<00:04:14.269> to<00:04:14.660> just

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
branches in it so we decided to just

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.379 
branches in it so we decided to just
keep<00:04:15.349> this<00:04:15.530> one<00:04:15.769> like<00:04:16.039> that<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:16.729> here's<00:04:17.359> a

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.409 
perfectly in the side with all the

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:33.490 
perfectly in the side with all the
guinea<00:04:27.590> pigs<00:04:27.830> on

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.200 

basically<00:04:34.500> we<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:34.770> used<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.520> piece<00:04:35.970> of

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
basically we just used this piece of

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.310 
basically we just used this piece of
wood<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.600> support<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.370> run<00:04:38.370> on<00:04:38.520> because<00:04:39.180> if<00:04:40.020> we

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
wood to support the run on because if we

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.740 
wood to support the run on because if we
just<00:04:40.500> had<00:04:40.680> it<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.190> then<00:04:41.570> chances<00:04:42.570> are

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
just had it like that then chances are

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.140 
just had it like that then chances are
it<00:04:43.110> could<00:04:43.380> have<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> risk<00:04:44.130> of<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:45.120> know

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
it could have like a risk of you know

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.060 
it could have like a risk of you know
falling<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.380> we<00:04:46.470> really<00:04:46.740> wouldn't<00:04:46.920> want

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
falling in and we really wouldn't want

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.310 
falling in and we really wouldn't want
that<00:04:47.220> happening<00:04:47.730> so<00:04:48.060> it's<00:04:48.660> just<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.930> be<00:04:49.020> extra

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
that happening so it's just to be extra

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.710 
that happening so it's just to be extra
safe<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.920> we<00:04:50.190> have<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.400> sign<00:04:50.670> here<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.270> a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
be up here on this wall which is why it

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.920 
be up here on this wall which is why it
looks<00:05:16.590> very<00:05:17.010> green<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.330> blank<00:05:18.660> and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
looks very green and blank and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.110 
looks very green and blank and
everything<00:05:19.440> but<00:05:19.920> we<00:05:20.430> need<00:05:20.580> some<00:05:20.820> hooks

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
everything but we need some hooks

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.750 
everything but we need some hooks
because<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.600> fell<00:05:21.780> down<00:05:21.810> so<00:05:22.440> we<00:05:23.340> just<00:05:23.520> need<00:05:23.700> to

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
because it fell down so we just need to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.230

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
get some of them up there so we can have

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.050 
get some of them up there so we can have
the<00:05:27.420> pic<00:05:27.620> so<00:05:28.620> Bramley's<00:05:29.100> cage<00:05:29.400> has<00:05:29.730> stayed<00:05:30.030> the

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.960 
made this shelf any bigger he wouldn't
have<00:05:44.940> room<00:05:45.240> for<00:05:45.270> his<00:05:45.660> bed<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:46.800> that's<00:05:47.460> kind<00:05:47.940> of

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
have room for his bed so that's kind of

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.460 
have room for his bed so that's kind of
the<00:05:48.150> reason<00:05:48.300> why<00:05:48.690> we've<00:05:48.870> decided<00:05:49.200> not<00:05:49.350> to

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
the reason why we've decided not to

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.460 
the reason why we've decided not to
change<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:50.070> but<00:05:50.280> if<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.880> get<00:05:50.940> any<00:05:51.240> better<00:05:51.780> ideas

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
change it but if I get any better ideas

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.950 
change it but if I get any better ideas
than<00:05:52.890> this<00:05:53.160> then<00:05:53.520> I<00:05:53.730> might<00:05:54.090> consider<00:05:54.450> them<00:05:54.750> and

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
than this then I might consider them and

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.860 
than this then I might consider them and
maybe<00:05:55.770> change<00:05:56.520> things<00:05:56.790> around<00:05:57.030> a<00:05:57.240> bit<00:05:57.270> but<00:05:57.570> for

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
maybe change things around a bit but for

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.490 
maybe change things around a bit but for
now<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.610> for<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.700> next<00:05:59.730> while<00:06:00.660> I<00:06:00.870> think<00:06:01.170> I'll

now and for the next while I think I'll
