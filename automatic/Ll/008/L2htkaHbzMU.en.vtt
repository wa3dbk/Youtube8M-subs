all right here we have the new dragoness

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:12.790 
all right here we have the new dragoness
two<00:00:11.680> from

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
two from

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.350

hobby<00:00:12.920> lobby<00:00:13.190> and<00:00:13.460> I<00:00:13.490> say<00:00:13.670> new<00:00:13.850> because<00:00:14.180> this

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
hobby lobby and I say new because this

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.380 
hobby lobby and I say new because this
is<00:00:14.570> actually<00:00:15.050> the<00:00:15.140> arc<00:00:15.380> version<00:00:16.060> which<00:00:17.060> they

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
is actually the arc version which they

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.120 
is actually the arc version which they
are<00:00:18.320> going<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:18.530> be<00:00:18.590> selling<00:00:18.770> really<00:00:19.100> soon<00:00:19.310> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
are going to be selling really soon and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.410 
are going to be selling really soon and
as<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:22.279> can<00:00:22.430> see<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.610> built<00:00:22.910> it<00:00:23.060> pretty<00:00:23.300> much

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
as you can see I built it pretty much

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.040 
as you can see I built it pretty much
stock<00:00:23.869> a<00:00:24.820> couple<00:00:25.820> little<00:00:25.970> personal<00:00:26.840> touches

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
stock a couple little personal touches

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.319 
stock a couple little personal touches
here<00:00:27.470> we've<00:00:27.619> got<00:00:27.800> some<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.029> is<00:00:29.180> just

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:29.329 
here we've got some this is just

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.269 
here we've got some this is just
automotive<00:00:30.050> fuel<00:00:30.349> line<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.890> have<00:00:30.980> sliced

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
automotive fuel line that have sliced

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.770 
automotive fuel line that have sliced
and<00:00:31.550> put<00:00:31.640> on<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.820> skids<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.360> keep<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:32.660> from

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
and put on the skids to keep it from

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.270 
and put on the skids to keep it from
being<00:00:32.960> abraded<00:00:33.410> because<00:00:33.590> I<00:00:33.710> fly<00:00:33.920> off<00:00:34.100> of

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
being abraded because I fly off of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.630 
being abraded because I fly off of
concrete<00:00:35.210> quite<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.570> bit<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:37.160> tail<00:00:37.370> servo

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
concrete quite a bit the tail servo

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.680 
concrete quite a bit the tail servo
mount<00:00:38.090> I<00:00:38.390> chose<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.290> use<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.440> futaba<00:00:40.220> 9650<00:00:41.120> along

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
mount I chose to use a futaba 9650 along

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.170 
mount I chose to use a futaba 9650 along
with<00:00:41.780> my<00:00:41.899> 401<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:43.489> won't<00:00:43.610> fit<00:00:43.910> in<00:00:44.149> the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
with my 401 and that won't fit in the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.069 
with my 401 and that won't fit in the
frame<00:00:44.570> mount<00:00:45.019> so<00:00:46.239> there<00:00:47.239> are<00:00:47.390> two<00:00:47.600> options<00:00:47.780> to

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
frame mount so there are two options to

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.619 
frame mount so there are two options to
mount<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.469> one<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.399> bracket<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:50.329> bolts

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
mount it one is a bracket that bolts

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.720 
mount it one is a bracket that bolts
onto<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.929> side<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.320> frame<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.489> and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
onto the side of the frame and the and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.919 
onto the side of the frame and the and
the<00:00:52.760> servo<00:00:53.059> just<00:00:53.239> sits<00:00:53.420> in<00:00:53.510> sideways

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
the servo just sits in sideways

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.950 
the servo just sits in sideways
unfortunately<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.949> item<00:00:55.219> was<00:00:55.370> on<00:00:55.489> backorder

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
unfortunately that item was on backorder

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.829 
unfortunately that item was on backorder
so<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.379> ordered<00:00:57.829> these<00:00:58.219> nice<00:00:58.969> alloy<00:00:59.449> boob

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
so I ordered these nice alloy boob

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.720 
so I ordered these nice alloy boob
mounts<00:01:00.289> from<00:01:01.000> RC<00:01:02.019> techcom<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.739> as<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.610> can

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
mounts from RC techcom and as you can

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.510 
mounts from RC techcom and as you can
see<00:01:04.760> they<00:01:05.000> are<00:01:05.030> really<00:01:05.990> nice<00:01:06.200> fit<00:01:06.620> they<00:01:07.280> fit

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
see they are really nice fit they fit

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.740 
see they are really nice fit they fit
the<00:01:07.550> twelve<00:01:07.880> point<00:01:08.090> eight<00:01:08.120> millimeter<00:01:08.540> boom

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
the twelve point eight millimeter boom

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.280 
the twelve point eight millimeter boom
so<00:01:09.700> some<00:01:10.700> people<00:01:10.970> have<00:01:11.090> used<00:01:11.240> plastic<00:01:11.540> t-rex

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
so some people have used plastic t-rex

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.660 
so some people have used plastic t-rex
mouths<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:12.740> you<00:01:12.830> do<00:01:12.950> have<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.159> stretch<00:01:13.520> them

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
mouths but you do have to stretch them

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.250 
mouths but you do have to stretch them
out<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.090> I'm<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.600> not<00:01:14.720> comfortable<00:01:14.900> doing

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
out and I'm just not comfortable doing

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.620 
out and I'm just not comfortable doing
that<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.420> other<00:01:17.420> than<00:01:17.510> that<00:01:17.690> I<00:01:18.290> believe<00:01:19.010> it's

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
that so other than that I believe it's

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.030 
that so other than that I believe it's
pretty<00:01:20.630> much<00:01:20.780> stock<00:01:21.080> let's<00:01:21.470> pull<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> hood

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
pretty much stock let's pull the hood

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.350 
pretty much stock let's pull the hood
off<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.400> we'll<00:01:22.520> go<00:01:22.640> over<00:01:22.670> where<00:01:23.000> everything's

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
off and we'll go over where everything's

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.440 
off and we'll go over where everything's
mounted<00:01:23.740> okay<00:01:24.740> hoods<00:01:25.010> off<00:01:25.220> just<00:01:26.120> one<00:01:26.240> quick

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
mounted okay hoods off just one quick

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.290 
mounted okay hoods off just one quick
comment<00:01:26.830> there<00:01:27.830> were<00:01:27.950> no<00:01:27.980> grommets<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.270> I

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
comment there were no grommets that I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.960 
comment there were no grommets that I
could<00:01:29.600> see<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.990> came<00:01:30.200> with<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.620> so<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
could see that came with this so the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.090 
could see that came with this so the
holes<00:01:32.180> here<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.020> canopy<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.620> just<00:01:33.830> used<00:01:34.010> a

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
holes here in the canopy I just used a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.530 
holes here in the canopy I just used a
dremel<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:35.080> made<00:01:36.080> them<00:01:36.290> fairly<00:01:36.800> large<00:01:37.540> and

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
dremel and made them fairly large and

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.570 
dremel and made them fairly large and
then<00:01:38.870> I<00:01:38.930> slipped<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.380> bit<00:01:39.410> of<00:01:39.710> fuel<00:01:39.950> tubing<00:01:40.430> over

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
then I slipped a bit of fuel tubing over

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.150 
then I slipped a bit of fuel tubing over
the<00:01:40.850> posts<00:01:41.330> here<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.200> small<00:01:42.560> diameter

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
the posts here this is small diameter

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.760 
the posts here this is small diameter
model<00:01:43.730> airplane<00:01:44.000> fuel<00:01:44.210> tubing<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.770> that

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
model airplane fuel tubing and that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.670 
model airplane fuel tubing and that
gives<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.070> nice<00:01:46.220> little<00:01:46.550> cushiony<00:01:47.150> fit<00:01:47.680> over

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
gives a nice little cushiony fit over

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.850 
gives a nice little cushiony fit over
the<00:01:48.710> mounting<00:01:49.070> pegs<00:01:50.260> let's<00:01:51.260> see<00:01:51.410> that<00:01:51.620> speed

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
the mounting pegs let's see that speed

controller<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.520> was<00:01:52.670> provided<00:01:52.940> was<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.360> Jedi

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
controller that was provided was a Jedi

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.460 
controller that was provided was a Jedi
model<00:01:54.590> spin<00:01:55.340> 33<00:01:56.000> which<00:01:56.900> is<00:01:57.050> a<00:01:57.080> very<00:01:57.290> nice

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
model spin 33 which is a very nice

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.710 
model spin 33 which is a very nice
programmable<00:01:58.190> speed<00:01:58.400> controller<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.510> do

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
programmable speed controller and you do

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.570 
programmable speed controller and you do
the<00:01:59.840> programming<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.980> can<00:02:01.160> do<00:02:01.310> some

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
the programming you can do some

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.010 
the programming you can do some
programming<00:02:01.760> with<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.330> transmitter<00:02:02.780> but

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
programming with the transmitter but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.290 
programming with the transmitter but
it's<00:02:03.320> far<00:02:04.160> better<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.460> use<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.820> spin<00:02:05.060> box

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
it's far better to use the spin box

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.020 
it's far better to use the spin box
controller<00:02:05.840> which<00:02:06.710> it's<00:02:07.460> really<00:02:07.700> cool<00:02:07.970> you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
actually where the wires come out will

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.589 
actually where the wires come out will
actually<00:03:24.709> interfere<00:03:25.130> with<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> frame<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.569> i

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
actually interfere with the frame so i

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.720 
actually interfere with the frame so i
actually<00:03:27.049> did<00:03:27.470> use<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> dremel<00:03:27.980> sanding<00:03:28.519> drum

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730

and sand the frame back very slightly

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.190 
and sand the frame back very slightly
and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.850> slit<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.420> little<00:03:32.660> piece<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.840> fuel

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
and then I slit a little piece of fuel

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.479 
and then I slit a little piece of fuel
tubing<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.620> slipped<00:03:33.889> it<00:03:33.950> over<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:34.280> frame

tubing and slipped it over the frame

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.250 
tubing and slipped it over the frame
there<00:03:34.519> to<00:03:34.850> keep<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.209> wires<00:03:35.450> from<00:03:35.600> possibly

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
there to keep the wires from possibly

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.390 
there to keep the wires from possibly
chafing<00:03:36.769> against<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.190> frame<00:03:37.400> here<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:37.910> here

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
chafing against the frame here and here

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.509 
chafing against the frame here and here

down<00:04:21.889> here<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.849> space<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.150> up<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
down here to space it up so that the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.480 
down here to space it up so that the
antennas<00:04:24.560> will<00:04:24.770> come<00:04:24.950> out<00:04:25.039> of<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.220> frame

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
antennas will come out of the frame

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.879 
antennas will come out of the frame
without<00:04:25.639> touching<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:30.530> stuff<00:04:30.740> is

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
without touching it that the stuff is

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.830 
without touching it that the stuff is
really<00:04:31.070> useful<00:04:31.310> to<00:04:31.520> have<00:04:31.639> around<00:04:31.700> these<00:04:32.630> two

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
really useful to have around these two

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.240 
really useful to have around these two
pieces<00:04:33.050> here<00:04:33.440> are<00:04:33.590> actually<00:04:33.740> glued<00:04:34.130> together

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
pieces here are actually glued together

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.140 
pieces here are actually glued together
with<00:04:34.550> CA<00:04:34.789> and<00:04:35.419> for<00:04:35.810> mounting<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.169> gyro<00:04:37.150> that

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
with CA and for mounting the gyro that

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.129 
with CA and for mounting the gyro that
you<00:04:38.450> can<00:04:38.599> see<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.840> gray<00:04:39.110> that's<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.590> 3m

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
you can see the gray that's the 3m

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.659 
you can see the gray that's the 3m
grey<00:04:41.300> double<00:04:42.300> stick<00:04:42.599> tape<00:04:42.629> which<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.199> awesome

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
grey double stick tape which is awesome

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.379 
grey double stick tape which is awesome
but<00:04:44.669> it<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.960> CA<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:47.280> gray<00:04:47.520> foam<00:04:47.849> is<00:04:48.090> see

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
but it is the CA the gray foam is see

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.739 
but it is the CA the gray foam is see
aid<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.960> green<00:04:49.259> stuff<00:04:49.620> and<00:04:50.449> then<00:04:51.449> of

00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:51.749 
aid to the green stuff and then of

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.480 
aid to the green stuff and then of
course<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.110> just<00:04:52.289> stick<00:04:52.499> the<00:04:52.620> gray<00:04:52.830> tape<00:04:53.189> to

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
course you just stick the gray tape to

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.550 
course you just stick the gray tape to
the<00:04:53.639> frame<00:04:53.849> into<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.150> gyro<00:04:54.389> so<00:04:55.199> it<00:04:55.259> gives<00:04:55.379> you

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
the frame into the gyro so it gives you

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.300 
the frame into the gyro so it gives you
a<00:04:55.590> nice<00:04:55.800> cushy<00:04:56.749> gyro<00:04:57.749> mount<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.680> isolate<00:04:59.279> from

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
a nice cushy gyro mount to isolate from

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.339 
a nice cushy gyro mount to isolate from
vibration<00:05:02.060> that's<00:05:03.060> about<00:05:03.330> it<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.689> head<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.930> got

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
vibration that's about it the head I got

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.260 
vibration that's about it the head I got
set<00:05:04.590> up<00:05:04.620> at<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.039> beginner<00:05:05.460> level<00:05:05.699> as<00:05:05.969> far<00:05:06.180> as

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
set up at the beginner level as far as

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.769 
set up at the beginner level as far as
the<00:05:06.360> programmable<00:05:07.279> link<00:05:08.279> locations<00:05:08.819> and<00:05:09.060> even

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
the programmable link locations and even

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.390 
the programmable link locations and even
at<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.900> beginner<00:05:10.169> level<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:10.650> cyclic<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.189> very

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
at the beginner level the cyclic is very

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.939 
at the beginner level the cyclic is very
quick<00:05:11.699> so<00:05:12.300> if<00:05:12.569> you<00:05:12.689> are<00:05:12.870> an<00:05:13.139> actual<00:05:13.620> beginner

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
quick so if you are an actual beginner

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.830 
quick so if you are an actual beginner
you<00:05:14.639> would<00:05:14.789> probably<00:05:15.150> want<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.389> put<00:05:15.509> some<00:05:15.659> fly

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
you would probably want to put some fly

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.330 
you would probably want to put some fly
bar<00:05:16.050> weights<00:05:16.259> on<00:05:16.439> as<00:05:16.590> well<00:05:16.770> because<00:05:17.159> the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
bar weights on as well because the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.429 
bar weights on as well because the
cyclic<00:05:17.729> is<00:05:17.909> quite<00:05:18.180> quick<00:05:18.449> either<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.110> or<00:05:19.259> you

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
cyclic is quite quick either that or you

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.290 
cyclic is quite quick either that or you
can<00:05:19.529> use<00:05:19.560> some<00:05:19.830> expo<00:05:20.189> in<00:05:20.310> your<00:05:20.430> radio<00:05:20.699> and<00:05:23.300> see

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
can use some expo in your radio and see

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.909 
can use some expo in your radio and see
is<00:05:24.539> there<00:05:24.659> anything<00:05:24.870> else<00:05:25.169> that<00:05:25.379> I<00:05:25.680> found

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
is there anything else that I found

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.059 
is there anything else that I found
interesting<00:05:26.189> about<00:05:26.610> this<00:05:27.620> this<00:05:28.620> is<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.830> stock

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
would actually prefer to use a 12 but

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.350 
would actually prefer to use a 12 but

found<00:05:41.249> very<00:05:41.520> surprising<00:05:42.150> is<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.300> in<00:05:42.599> the

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 
found very surprising is that in the

found very surprising is that in the

little information sheet that came with
the<00:05:43.949> motor<00:05:44.189> they<00:05:44.879> actually<00:05:45.089> recommended<00:05:45.779> a<00:05:45.930> 14

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560

for extreme speeds well that is way

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.189 
for extreme speeds well that is way
outside<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:54.060> realm<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.599> what<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:54.900> would<00:05:54.990> want

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
and a 15 tooth I didn't even calculate

and a 15 tooth I didn't even calculate
it<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.169> would<00:06:04.409> be<00:06:04.589> way<00:06:04.740> too<00:06:04.770> high<00:06:05.099> so<00:06:06.020> that's

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
it it would be way too high so that's
