00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 mercedes presents the new one here in paris 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.990
 amg gt declined in two levels of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.910
 power you see is an empty 4,000 here 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.320
 we have four 162 horses can be 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 the s version we're going to see with 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.080
 510 horses but watch the price only if 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.029
 you are wealthy but you can afford it 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.500
 certainly not that net that disfigures 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 it's a bit anti 911 if we want to define it 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.970
 very beautiful headlights half led metak up to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.949
 yesterday is really dull gray 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 a very beautiful bonnet 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.040
 extended a cockpit moved towards 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.260
 the rear axle look at the line 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 of the belt and look at the similarity 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.860
 with the 911 here with the hips extended 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.120
 at the back and maybe a moment inside 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 to show how inside a cockpit 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.890
 really very well defined 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.260
 very large and the display the display 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.579
 central that controls all the functions 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 of the car when to see from the other 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 part of the area reserved for the driver 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.880
 we could also say to the pilot behind 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.119
 headlights even here very beautiful full LED 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 design also here tapering 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 and the fact that it accompanies the machine 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.479
 sideways and here we have a spoiler 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.610
 that comes out when we increase the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.509
 speed I told you he wants to show 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.140
 the driving seat is waiting for the colleague who 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.549
 get out of the car 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 very beautiful the steering wheel very very racing 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.070
 and we say that the bridge in front of the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.430
 pilot's and standard eyes therefore it is not 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.590
 a lcd like a bit of fashion from these 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.479
 times as we go towards the s 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.350
 here from 510 horses 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.090
 you can see here a class s always ai 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.710
 medium because we are in the restricted area 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.950
 to the ball 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.940
 to the sports brand of mercedes 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.610
 we also have a class c 63 amg here of 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.900
 in front of us maybe 63 on which 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.729
 we go up because it's really bad too 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.440
 inside 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.350
 look how beautiful the seats here too 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.120
 the now-become tablet is resumed 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:26.320
 iconic for mercedes serious goalkeeper 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.550
 large red and large stitching finishes 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.780
 download look how nice the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.780
 back of this c 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.500
