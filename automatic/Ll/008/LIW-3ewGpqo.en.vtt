00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.689
 two 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.750
 you guys remember that video where you 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 explained the assembly of the cage for 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.270
 chinchilla 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.520
 Well, if you do not remember, look 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.510
 because it is important before listening 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.220
 this other you will see where to choose the place 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 suitable to put the chinchillas in 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.000
 house is important because 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.510
 chinchillas tolerate the cold very well 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.450
 but very bad the heat their coats are 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.080
 adapted to withstand temperatures 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 extremes of cold and maybe also something the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.010
 hot but obviously a bad place 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.340
 would be where we are now in front of the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 fireplace closer to bad radiators 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 we will choose sites where there is no 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.199
 currents but that are far from 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.450
 heating systems especially in the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 winter that soon because we tend to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.160
 turn on heaters and so on 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080
 these terraces are good places 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.960
 glazed where you can condense 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.140
 too much heat in the summer is worth 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.030
 then once we have chosen the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.479
 site of the house for the first days 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 is also very important the issue of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.650
 tranquility the first days that the 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.430
 animal arrives 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.960
 the stress is maximum so we're going to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.600
 put them in a place they are in 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.200
 penumbra as I already told you in the other 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.290
 video the chinchillas are animals of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.110
 Twilight habits even at night 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.150
 how they are likely to be 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.360
 actually hunted the pyramid 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.250
 food are the dams all these 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.130
 animals tend to come out in the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.980
 twilight or at night where others 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.660
 diurnal animals can not hunt them 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.210
 ok they are worth so to speak of the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.860
 darkness and the hiding places therefore 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.950
 they will be much more comfortable in 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.350
 house at sunset and at night you go to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.560
 see that they mostly come into activity 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.150
 well when evening comes even 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.700
 at night and during the first 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.680
 early hours also 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.170
 for this and so that they are comfortable 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.290
 to put them the first days in places 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.690
 that are not very busy I do not know if 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.670
 you also have more animals at home but 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.500
 normally they will be very afraid of 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.959
 cats and a lot of fear of dogs is very 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.540
 common that especially the dogs are put 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.160
 to bark near where the cage is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.590
 with chinchillas where there is a cage with 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.519
 rabbits stressing a lot to these 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.950
 animals 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.500
 the stress during the first days is 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.330
 horrible because the animals apart from 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.000
 that come from traveling from the store to 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.190
 your house have to adapt to a 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.930
 site that you do not know is worth so 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.000
 let's try to minimize to the extent 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.459
 of possible the stress and also 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 I take this opportunity to tell you that the changes 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.440
 abrupt feeding also suppose 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.030
 a stress on animals when 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.890
 we usually talk about stress all the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.950
 world associates stress by being nervous 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.780
 to animal 1 the stress in which it is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.750
 nervous that you are being 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.640
 scary but fix a change of 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.549
 rough feeding also means a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.380
 physiological stress a stress in the 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.730
 metabolism in normal food in 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.470
 the habit 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.930
 of the normal digestive system of 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.730
 animals so try not to change 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.319
 feeding with respect to 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.409
 food that they also take in 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.150
 stores is worth trying if you want to do 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.959
 a change of power to do 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.959
 always progressive do it at 50% of the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.540
 old food and new and good food 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.489
 here a little more to say I leave you a 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.530
 I'm here for you so you can take a 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.040
 look and see how they adapt to your 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.840
 new environment try to recreate 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.090
 environments similar to those they have in 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.739
 the store and these environments after 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.690
 we will adapt them to what we 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.329
 we want to achieve but always 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.590
 changes any type of change should 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.590
 be little by little
