00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
lot more gates one of the problems for

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.530 
lot more gates one of the problems for
TC<00:01:37.520> at<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.640> moment<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.180> very<00:01:38.390> small

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
TC at the moment is the very small

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.790 
TC at the moment is the very small
number<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.840> gates<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.320> there's<00:01:39.440> clearly<00:01:39.650> a

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
number of gates and there's clearly a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.650 
number of gates and there's clearly a
lot<00:01:40.100> more<00:01:40.310> at<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.850> moment<00:01:41.180> there's<00:01:41.330> just<00:01:41.479> one

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
lot more at the moment there's just one

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.330 
lot more at the moment there's just one
gate<00:01:41.900> line<00:01:42.080> for<00:01:42.290> northern<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.740> central<00:01:43.220> line

gate line for northern and central line
but<00:01:43.759> that<00:01:43.880> will<00:01:44.030> double<00:01:44.240> as<00:01:44.509> when<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.900> central

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
but that will double as when the central

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.680 
but that will double as when the central
line<00:01:45.440> works<00:01:45.650> are<00:01:45.830> complete<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:46.340> 2015<00:01:47.330> each

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
line works are complete in 2015 each

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.570 
line works are complete in 2015 each
line<00:01:48.080> will<00:01:48.229> have<00:01:48.350> its<00:01:48.470> own<00:01:48.650> separate<00:01:49.340> gate

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
line will have its own separate gate

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.210 
line will have its own separate gate
line<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:50.960> standing<00:01:51.259> in<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.530> wall<00:01:51.710> with<00:01:52.100> it

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
line so I'm standing in a wall with it

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.650 
line so I'm standing in a wall with it
like<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.490> do<00:01:52.640> not<00:01:52.790> pass<00:01:53.060> line<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.600> is

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
like the do not pass line this is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.320 
like the do not pass line this is
between<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.140> tube<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:54.640> over<00:01:55.640> here<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:55.940> cross

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
between the tube and over here is cross

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.880 
between the tube and over here is cross
rail<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.050> all<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.290> tube<00:01:57.530> will<00:01:57.800> be

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
rail so that all the tube will be

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.340 
rail so that all the tube will be
completed<00:01:58.400> in<00:01:58.520> September<00:01:59.000> 2016<00:01:59.750> but<00:02:00.110> behind

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
completed in September 2016 but behind

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.139 
completed in September 2016 but behind
me<00:02:00.500> here<00:02:00.770> there<00:02:01.310> will<00:02:01.399> be<00:02:01.430> escalators<00:02:01.820> going

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
me here there will be escalators going

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.880 
me here there will be escalators going
down<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.720> cross<00:02:02.960> rail<00:02:03.170> platform<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.740> that

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
down to the cross rail platform so that

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.780 
down to the cross rail platform so that
won't<00:02:04.070> be<00:02:04.160> open<00:02:04.399> here<00:02:04.580> until<00:02:05.050> 2018<00:02:06.790> behind

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
won't be open here until 2018 behind

won't be open here until 2018 behind
this<00:02:07.909> wall<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> seven<00:02:08.869> story<00:02:09.290> descent<00:02:09.800> which

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
this wall is a seven story descent which

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.830 
this wall is a seven story descent which
will<00:02:10.369> eventually<00:02:10.519> have<00:02:10.970> escalators<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> take

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
will eventually have escalators to take

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.699 
will eventually have escalators to take

you down to the cross rail platforms so

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.620 
you down to the cross rail platforms so

an increase in capacity as to what there
is<00:03:37.139> at<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.379> moment<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:38.030> remember<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.269> just

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
is at the moment and remember it is just

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.879 
is at the moment and remember it is just
the<00:03:39.719> new<00:03:39.870> Northern<00:03:40.170> Line<00:03:40.409> part<00:03:40.709> that's

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
the new Northern Line part that's

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.740 
the new Northern Line part that's
opening<00:03:41.280> up<00:03:41.400> first<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.180> central<00:03:42.540> line<00:03:42.629> will

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
opening up first the central line will

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.209 
opening up first the central line will
be<00:03:42.840> closed<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.409> then<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.590> new<00:03:43.709> part<00:03:43.950> will<00:03:44.129> lay

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:44.219 
be closed and then the new part will lay

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.699 
be closed and then the new part will lay
to<00:03:44.249> follow<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.879> then<00:03:45.419> cross<00:03:45.959> rail<00:03:46.200> much<00:03:46.469> later

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
to follow and then cross rail much later

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.920 
to follow and then cross rail much later
on<00:03:46.829> though<00:03:47.219> we<00:03:47.310> did<00:03:47.489> find<00:03:47.760> where<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.540> access

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
on though we did find where the access

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.289 
on though we did find where the access
point<00:03:49.230> was<00:03:49.620> blocked<00:03:49.769> out<00:03:50.129> so<00:03:50.639> down<00:03:50.849> there<00:03:51.030> is

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
point was blocked out so down there is

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.429 
point was blocked out so down there is
an<00:03:51.480> entrance<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.049> Northern<00:03:52.290> Line

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 
an entrance to the Northern Line

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.020 
an entrance to the Northern Line
currently<00:03:52.859> blocked<00:03:53.040> off<00:03:53.189> up<00:03:53.430> there<00:03:53.699> that<00:03:53.909> will

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
currently blocked off up there that will

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
currently blocked off up there that will
be<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> way<00:03:54.329> through<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.900> cross<00:03:55.109> rail<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:55.500> I

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
be a way through to cross rail so I

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.679 
be a way through to cross rail so I
think<00:03:55.650> I'm<00:03:56.340> going<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.699> go<00:03:56.939> back<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.510> way<00:03:57.659> I

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
think I'm going to go back the way I

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.780 
think I'm going to go back the way I
came<00:03:57.840> back<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.069> service<00:03:59.370> but<00:03:59.519> let's<00:03:59.639> just
