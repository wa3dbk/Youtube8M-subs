this

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
this

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.830 
this
and<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.670> fact<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:51.969> they<00:01:52.450> would<00:01:52.570> have<00:01:52.719> to

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and the fact that they would have to

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.810 
and the fact that they would have to
live<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.200> that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
live with that

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.850 
live with that
we've<00:01:55.780> obviously<00:01:55.990> measure<00:01:56.410> something<00:01:56.740> a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
we've obviously measure something a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.230 
we've obviously measure something a
certain<00:01:57.010> way<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.370> then<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.670> direct<00:01:57.790> Caesar

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240

certain way and then a direct Caesar
with<00:01:58.510> fresh<00:01:58.720> eyes<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.350> they<00:01:59.890> tend<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.340> have<00:02:01.030> a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
with fresh eyes and they tend to have a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.370 
with fresh eyes and they tend to have a
different<00:02:01.150> take<00:02:01.570> on<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.870> when<00:02:02.020> maybe<00:02:02.170> have

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
different take on that when maybe have

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.560 
different take on that when maybe have
slight<00:02:02.950> improvements<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.330> case

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
slight improvements and in this case

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.960 
slight improvements and in this case
materially<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.440> you've<00:02:05.620> kind<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.460> refined

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
materially and you've kind of refined

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.210 
materially and you've kind of refined
the<00:02:07.120> script<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.930> think<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.470> be<00:02:08.500> simplified

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the script and I think to be simplified

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.700 
the script and I think to be simplified
down<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:10.270> really<00:02:10.479> assess<00:02:11.110> where<00:02:11.350> we<00:02:11.380> perhaps

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
down to really assess where we perhaps

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.640 
down to really assess where we perhaps
added<00:02:12.160> future<00:02:12.760> new<00:02:12.910> layers<00:02:13.410> they've<00:02:14.410> got<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
added future new layers they've got a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.550 
added future new layers they've got a
bit<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.070> bad<00:02:18.360> straight<00:02:19.360> line<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.380> my<00:02:20.530> mind

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
bit of bad straight line but to my mind

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.580 
bit of bad straight line but to my mind
it<00:02:21.040> was<00:02:21.130> important<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:22.020> distill<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.260> story

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it was important to distill the story

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.230 
it was important to distill the story
down<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.780> its<00:02:25.780> its<00:02:26.260> core<00:02:26.760> insight<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:28.030> for

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
down to its its core insight which for

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.340 
down to its its core insight which for
me<00:02:28.420> was<00:02:28.720> this<00:02:29.680> one<00:02:30.280> distinct<00:02:31.090> memory<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.810> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
me was this one distinct memory of the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.050 
me was this one distinct memory of the
childhood<00:02:32.800> there's<00:02:33.070> always<00:02:33.250> there<00:02:33.670> wherever

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
childhood there's always there wherever

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.860 
childhood there's always there wherever
the<00:02:34.300> guy<00:02:34.450> goes<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:35.080> his<00:02:35.200> life<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.950> one

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the guy goes in his life is that one

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.070 
the guy goes in his life is that one
stark<00:02:37.870> image

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.300 

there's<00:02:46.010> still<00:02:46.220> 50%<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.510> vehicles<00:02:48.310> exceeding

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
there's still 50% of vehicles exceeding

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.140 
there's still 50% of vehicles exceeding
the<00:02:49.490> limit<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.630> 30<00:02:51.500> mile-an-hour<00:02:51.830> Road<00:02:52.580> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the limit in 30 mile-an-hour Road the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.060 
the limit in 30 mile-an-hour Road the
only<00:02:53.450> others<00:02:53.690> have<00:02:53.900> made<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> huge<00:02:55.010> change

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
only others have made a huge change

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
only others have made a huge change
since<00:02:56.320> 1996<00:02:57.320> we<00:02:57.770> had<00:02:57.920> 72<00:02:58.370> percent<00:02:58.820> of<00:02:58.940> people

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
since 1996 we had 72 percent of people

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.660 
since 1996 we had 72 percent of people
exceeding<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.230> 30<00:03:00.440> mile<00:03:00.680> an<00:03:00.710> hour<00:03:00.890> limit<00:03:01.010> and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
exceeding the 30 mile an hour limit and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.210 
exceeding the 30 mile an hour limit and
a<00:03:02.210> third<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.720> people<00:03:02.990> exceeding<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.830> by<00:03:04.010> more

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
a third of people exceeding it by more

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.100 
a third of people exceeding it by more
than<00:03:04.310> five<00:03:04.520> miles<00:03:04.790> per<00:03:04.940> hour<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.870> really

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
than five miles per hour so really

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.930 
than five miles per hour so really
getting<00:03:06.290> towards<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.980> faithful<00:03:07.460> territory

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
getting towards the faithful territory

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.550 
getting towards the faithful territory
so<00:03:08.420> we've<00:03:08.570> made<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.720> big<00:03:08.900> difference<00:03:09.050> already

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
so we've made a big difference already

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.740 
so we've made a big difference already
you<00:03:10.190> need<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.430> keep<00:03:10.550> bringing<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:10.970> down<00:03:11.180> it's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
you need to keep bringing it down it's

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.480 
you need to keep bringing it down it's
trying<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:12.920> tell<00:03:13.340> people<00:03:13.900> not<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.100> go<00:03:16.100> fast

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
trying to tell people not to go fast

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.130 
trying to tell people not to go fast
when<00:03:16.730> they're<00:03:16.970> driving<00:03:17.210> because<00:03:17.570> she<00:03:17.840> cannot
