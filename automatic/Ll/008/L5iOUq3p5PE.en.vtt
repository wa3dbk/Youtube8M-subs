the fact number five and number five I

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.330 
the fact number five and number five I
have<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.049> was<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.230> bit<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.650> sleeper<00:03:15.100> here<00:03:15.310> I

mean<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:16.150> all<00:03:16.299> depends<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:16.840> how<00:03:16.900> how<00:03:17.859> much

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
mean it all depends on how how much

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.680 
mean it all depends on how how much
though<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.430> Bengals<00:03:18.850> used<00:03:19.060> his<00:03:19.269> gentlemen

though the Bengals used his gentlemen
but<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:20.109> like<00:03:20.590> bernard<00:03:20.920> scott<00:03:21.160> i<00:03:21.400> think<00:03:21.910> they're

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
but I like bernard scott i think they're

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.849 
but I like bernard scott i think they're
not<00:03:22.150> stock<00:03:22.420> would<00:03:22.540> be<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> guy<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.230> can<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.829> a

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
not stock would be a guy that can be a

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.550 
not stock would be a guy that can be a
good<00:03:24.100> running<00:03:24.519> mechanism<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.450> if<00:03:26.350> he's

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
good running mechanism and if he's

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.250 
good running mechanism and if he's
giving<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.920> opportunity<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.700> i<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:29.049> think

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
giving the opportunity and i just think

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.900 
giving the opportunity and i just think
that<00:03:29.320> again<00:03:30.010> if<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.549> everything<00:03:30.880> is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
that again if you think everything is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.540 
that again if you think everything is
going<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.150> be
