00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
pedestal I guess it's a key I guess it's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.100 
pedestal I guess it's a key I guess it's
some<00:02:46.200> kind<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.500> secret<00:02:46.980> agent<00:02:47.519> I<00:02:47.760> mean<00:02:48.600> ancient

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110

either a triple form or this is part of
its<00:04:16.470> transformation<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:18.269> can<00:04:18.660> be<00:04:18.930> part

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
its transformation that this can be part

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.000 
its transformation that this can be part
of<00:04:19.380> its<00:04:19.530> transformation<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.370> suppose<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:25.010> then

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
of its transformation I suppose and then

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.189 
of its transformation I suppose and then
you<00:04:26.250> take<00:04:26.490> these<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.240> just<00:04:27.419> put<00:04:27.720> them<00:04:27.870> up
