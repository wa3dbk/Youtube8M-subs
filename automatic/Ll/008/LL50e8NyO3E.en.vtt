will<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.079> take<00:00:34.200> might<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.910> 110

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
will it take might to get up to that 110

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
will it take might to get up to that 110
111<00:00:37.200> mile<00:00:37.649> per<00:00:37.860> hour<00:00:37.890> range<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
111 mile per hour range which is about a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110 
111 mile per hour range which is about a
category<00:00:39.120> three<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:41.550> should<00:00:41.760> only<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
category three it should only be a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
category three it should only be a
minute<00:00:42.390> or<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.260> tunnel<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.890> quite

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
minute or two the tunnel can go up quite

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.400 
minute or two the tunnel can go up quite
fast<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:45.390> does<00:00:45.510> he<00:00:45.660> start<00:00:45.690> feeling<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
fast and when does he start feeling the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.170 
fast and when does he start feeling the
pain<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.980> why<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.430> he<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.730> wearing<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> helmet

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
pain and why is he not wearing a helmet

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.160 
pain and why is he not wearing a helmet
more<00:00:48.539> importantly<00:00:50.090> well<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
more importantly well we think for the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.330 
more importantly well we think for the
speeds<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.530> he's<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.070> at<00:00:53.190> we

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
speeds that he's going to be at we

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
speeds that he's going to be at we
should<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> okay<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.350> he'll

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
should be okay and I think we he'll

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
should be okay and I think we he'll
start<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> feel<00:00:56.309> some<00:00:56.579> pressure<00:00:56.730> once<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.300> get

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
start to feel some pressure once we get

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.110 
start to feel some pressure once we get
up<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:57.750> 75<00:00:58.320> miles<00:00:58.710> an<00:00:58.920> hour<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.789> we<00:00:59.969> look

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
up to about 75 miles an hour if we look

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.970 
up to about 75 miles an hour if we look
at<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> computer<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.620> where<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
at the computer that's right where we

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.190 
at the computer that's right where we
are<00:01:02.129> about<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.449> kind<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> force<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
are about now so what kind of force on

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.570 
are about now so what kind of force on
us<00:01:07.200> horse<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.070> his<00:01:08.250> body<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:09.020> about<00:01:10.580> 7080

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
us horse on his body is about 7080

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
us horse on his body is about 7080
pounds<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:12.240> now<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> goes<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.140> quite

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
pounds right now but it goes up quite

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.060 
pounds right now but it goes up quite
rapidly<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.810> once<00:01:15.810> we're<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> hundred<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.830> five

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
rapidly so once we're a hundred and five

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.580 
rapidly so once we're a hundred and five
the<00:01:17.850> force<00:01:18.119> will<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.330> about<00:01:18.600> 150<00:01:19.350> pounds

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
the force will be about 150 pounds

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.709 
the force will be about 150 pounds
which<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.219> a<00:01:21.250> lot<00:01:21.429> more<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.729> him<00:01:22.149> today<00:01:22.329> is

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
which is a lot more to him today is

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.639 
which is a lot more to him today is
there<00:01:22.960> any<00:01:23.079> wind<00:01:23.380> chill<00:01:23.560> in<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.770> tunnel<00:01:25.649> yes

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
there any wind chill in the tunnel yes

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.980 
there any wind chill in the tunnel yes
it's<00:01:26.859> um<00:01:27.100> it's<00:01:27.280> about<00:01:27.579> 10<00:01:27.939> or<00:01:28.090> 20<00:01:28.420> degrees<00:01:28.750> at

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
it's um it's about 10 or 20 degrees at

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.230 
it's um it's about 10 or 20 degrees at
this<00:01:29.140> point<00:01:29.439> but<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.429> weather<00:01:30.609> in<00:01:30.789> blacksburg

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
do you know he wants to get out of there

do you know he wants to get out of there
he<00:02:13.780> will<00:02:14.410> give<00:02:14.590> us<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.769> thumbs<00:02:15.010> down<00:02:15.160> when<00:02:15.879> he's

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
he will give us a thumbs down when he's

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.150 
he will give us a thumbs down when he's
had<00:02:16.239> enough<00:02:16.360> ok<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.110> window<00:02:17.470> has<00:02:17.739> airlock

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
had enough ok and the window has airlock

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.979 
had enough ok and the window has airlock
doors<00:02:18.459> why<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.150> I'm<00:02:19.450> assuming<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:19.900> you

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
doors why is that I'm assuming so you

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.729 
doors why is that I'm assuming so you
can<00:02:20.140> get<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.379> high<00:02:20.530> winds<00:02:22.049> because<00:02:23.049> when<00:02:23.530> you

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
can get the high winds because when you

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.960 
can get the high winds because when you
press<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.099> wind<00:02:24.280> speed<00:02:24.489> up<00:02:24.639> the<00:02:24.760> pressure

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
press the wind speed up the pressure

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.000 
press the wind speed up the pressure
goes<00:02:25.269> down<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.319> pressure<00:02:26.560> has<00:02:26.799> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
goes down and then the pressure has to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.849 
goes down and then the pressure has to
be<00:02:27.989> supported<00:02:28.989> by<00:02:29.139> the<00:02:29.200> room<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
be supported by the room that the

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.379 
be supported by the room that the

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
control room is in the Test section is

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.840 
control room is in the Test section is
in<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:32.470> total<00:02:32.680> force<00:02:33.069> on<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> control<00:02:33.670> room

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
in the total force on the control room

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.180 
in the total force on the control room
when<00:02:34.060> were<00:02:34.150> at<00:02:34.299> top<00:02:34.510> speed<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:34.930> around<00:02:35.190> 160

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
when were at top speed is around 160

point I think so i think i think i'm not

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.970 
point I think so i think i think i'm not
quite<00:03:01.780> sure<00:03:01.810> where<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.139> point<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:02.950> i

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
quite sure where that point is but i

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.280 
quite sure where that point is but i
think<00:03:03.280> baby<00:03:03.459> above<00:03:03.790> up<00:03:03.910> at<00:03:04.030> 130<00:03:04.690> or<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.109> would

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
think baby above up at 130 or so would

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.470 
think baby above up at 130 or so would
be<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:06.489> probably<00:03:06.700> would<00:03:06.970> start<00:03:07.209> getting<00:03:07.419> a

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
be we probably would start getting a

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.759 
be we probably would start getting a
