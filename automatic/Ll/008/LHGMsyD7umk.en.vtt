00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it that and let me guess as we move from

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.469 
it that and let me guess as we move from
C<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.920> R<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.879> we're<00:02:09.030> working<00:02:09.060> our<00:02:09.450> way

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
C to R you see we're working our way

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
C to R you see we're working our way
down<00:02:09.599> crap

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
down crap

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.750 
down crap
our<00:02:12.830> stands<00:02:13.830> probably<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.310> refined

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
our stands probably for refined

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610 
our stands probably for refined
carbohydrates<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.780> fine<00:02:16.019> sugars<00:02:16.440> refined

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.070 
carbohydrates for fine sugars refined
sugar<00:02:17.220> exactly<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.299> let's<00:02:18.480> take<00:02:18.629> a<00:02:18.659> look<00:02:18.900> at

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
sugar exactly so let's take a look at

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.080 
sugar exactly so let's take a look at
this<00:02:19.230> animation<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.830> woman<00:02:20.099> who's<00:02:20.489> enjoying

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.430 
to think to exercise the insulin does
something<00:03:20.340> else<00:03:20.459> quite<00:03:21.150> interesting<00:03:21.930> what<00:03:22.319> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
something else quite interesting what it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.170 
something else quite interesting what it
does<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.099> actually<00:03:23.430> tells<00:03:23.669> your<00:03:23.819> body<00:03:23.970> to

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
does is it actually tells your body to

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.110 
does is it actually tells your body to
store<00:03:24.480> fat<00:03:25.250> that's<00:03:26.250> why<00:03:26.489> when<00:03:26.700> you're<00:03:26.849> eating

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
store fat that's why when you're eating

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.640 
store fat that's why when you're eating
too<00:03:27.419> many<00:03:27.569> sugars<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:29.069> does<00:03:29.700> end<00:03:30.389> up<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:31.260> fat

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
too many sugars it does end up as fat

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.949 
too many sugars it does end up as fat
typically<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.819> lot<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.150> it'll<00:03:33.299> be<00:03:33.389> visceral<00:03:33.810> fat

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
typically a lot of it'll be visceral fat

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.240 
typically a lot of it'll be visceral fat
that's<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.440> fat<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.889> surrounds<00:03:34.980> your

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that's the fat that surrounds your

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.370 
that's the fat that surrounds your
internal<00:03:35.639> organs<00:03:35.790> people<00:03:36.690> think<00:03:36.900> well<00:03:37.049> if

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
internal organs people think well if

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.589 
internal organs people think well if
it's<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.739> sugar<00:03:37.950> that's<00:03:38.310> fine<00:03:38.609> no<00:03:39.090> sugar

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
it's just sugar that's fine no sugar

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.930 
it's just sugar that's fine no sugar
actually<00:03:39.930> too<00:03:40.290> much<00:03:40.349> of<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.650> will<00:03:41.099> end<00:03:41.790> up

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
actually too much of it will end up

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.580 
actually too much of it will end up
turning<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.299> fat<00:03:42.480> in<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.660> body<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.349> some
