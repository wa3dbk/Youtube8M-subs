 Rock climbing showdown 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 Ninety-nine plus

 I took my foot off the side of summer when I was at bat 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 It was the selfish continuous throw of the day and the balance wii rising on the screen every day 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.900
 It was easy to lower the bridge to the board for the first time ever

 It becomes clear to 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.050
 It will fall when it comes to an unreasonable system that makes a voice 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.730
 Becoming an intermediate class 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.549
 The fitness gauge is displayed 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.010

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:42.909
 It will fall when I talk so 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.909
 Still 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.319
 Not slippery at all 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.349
 Deaf line hold up will appear 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.279
 Return to a stable system from the background of the incident 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.289
