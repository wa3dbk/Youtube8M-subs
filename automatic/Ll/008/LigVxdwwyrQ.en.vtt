00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello, my name is public so far 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.639
 I am a developer of apps for ios in 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.400
 2012 I attended the basic course in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.870
 objects have since I published a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.619
 twenty apps in the store 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.970
 the course was very useful indeed I have 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 received a lot of material I have 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.189
 exploited to publish the first 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 applications 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 moreover thanks to the course I entered a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.180
 be part of the developer group 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.399
 lieutenant psi objects on facebook in the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.020
 which you can get help in 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.809
 about the problems that can be created 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.500
 when programming an app 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.160
 during the course 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 marcello who would be the teacher explains 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.280
 at the basics of the course and helps you understand 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.829
 the xcode programming environment 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.039
 also an extremely person 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.010
 available any mail contact 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.110
 1 try to have with him to get 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 the help maybe in the development phase of 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.020
 an application he is always available 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.720
 and rai to help to give advice and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.830
 solve problems before this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 course I had never planned in fact 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 I tried amatorial jam to start 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 this career but with scarce say 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.560
 results 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.140
 then thanks to the course 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.299
 thanks to marcello I managed to have 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.149
 the first results 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.680
 in fact after the course it is latent 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.119
 published my first app, yes 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.829
 call and drame pro which is a simulator 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.140
 of percussion then in the musical field 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.409
 later I published other applications 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 in the turnaround time of a month that was 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.390
 need a little game e 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.159
 entertainment that was called under 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.500
 Christmas and design is never called 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.330
 sold Santa Claus who were in fact 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.429
 in Christmas theme they have gone a lot 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.920
 good for storage by also combining the first 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.799
 positions of its category 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.819
 then in the following year developed 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.430
 many other apps as in a very manner 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.380
 rapid like black hole streets graham that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.130
 they could be a pastime that they were 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.590
 to talk about the code that then has them 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.239
 published later but gradually 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.010
 but it goes on 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.380
 I started 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.850
 undertake more complex projects 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.240
 which therefore require more 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.950
 experience, however, while refined 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.410
 also music applications with 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.680
 stage battery crib that includes 11 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.000
 set of batteries of various musical genres 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.010
 of various musical genres that are in two 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.510
 versions of this app are bound to happen 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 even a free version is a version a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.140
 payment in such a way a 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.459
 all of you to download it to know it 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.989
 after which I published a recipe book well 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.650
 more complex which is called in focus 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:09.700
 slow in which there are enclosed 130 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.250
 recipes was a recipe book based on 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.260
 pin up theme so a theme not a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.590
 little vintage in which it is possible 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.930
 also find other utilities such as timers 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 a shopping list was right 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.110
 the actress to do conversion 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.320
 however measurements as far as 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.400
 concerns the weight of food 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.330
 then I devoted myself to programming 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.090
 first video game left-handed mike jump that is 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.660
 just as a jumper also suggests 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.560
 game 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.989
 this was a challenge 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.880
 hard to deal with alone because 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.060
 however in the programming phase 1 yes 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.340
 finds to have various problems but 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.530
 unknowns that must be resolved in time 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.730
 optimally short for giving 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.500
 a positive gaming experience 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.290
 user and above all in one thing 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.819
 very difficult to challenge so to speak 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 in the majors of the developments 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.470
 we say of the manufacturers of the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.260
 software to software house therefore for 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.280
 try to make a competitive product 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.680
 a competitive application 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.760
 I had to program this game in 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.859
 free way in the sense to distribute 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.109
 the game but it was free with in the app 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.060
 purchase without one 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.090
 therefore extremely invasive advertising 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.169
 leave a lot of publicity 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.490
 second floor so as to make 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.190
 entertain users 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.220
 so this was my goal 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.300
 know my product not so much for 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.699
 the gains but for satisfaction 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.889
 personal and so far there has been a 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.240
 excellent feedback 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.919
 I have reached numerous requests for 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.889
 collaboration from other programmers 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.910
 documents however continued to develop 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.430
 app individually because I wanted to put myself 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.840
 to the test and continue these mine 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.860
 projects 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.039
 I'm preparing these updates 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.470
 for left-handed mike who consist of 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:06.639
 worlds expansions improvements e 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.680
 especially of themes based on 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.569
 festivities that will arrive as per 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.099
 example the recurrence of halloween or the 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.550
 Christmas recurrence 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:18.669
 so there will be changes 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.610
 according to me fun in addition to the app 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:25.870
 store I also take a kind of 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.710
 online trading platform of 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.750
 which I hope will be discussed later 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.750
 however the apps are a great project
