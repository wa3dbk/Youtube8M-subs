00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.480
 hello dear hungry very different than 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.400
 The title may suggest that 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.439
 Today's recipe is completely meatless and 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.660
 It does not come from China, it is today 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.250
 cold round you certainly known 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.289
 probably with now, of course 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.850
 chocolate our cold today is white 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.680
 and there are a few more 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.720
 nuances in the ratio of the traditional ones 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.940
 Variant for all the white chocolate 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.280
 In any case, we have to form a must 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.260
 for biscuits in the conventional 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.059
 Variation will be square butter biscuits 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.510
 I use this round chocolate 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.360
 cookies 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.420
 further we need butter legally 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.200
 white chocolate chopped almonds or 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.600
 also because the electrical and something 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.620
 chocolate decoration being totally flexible here 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.180
 we could first cut the 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.870
 Throw butter in and put in one 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.670
 bowl and proceed with connect 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.050
 the white chocolate as well chop it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.289
 so rough and give me that 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.460
 key in 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.530
 this mixture is now the water bath 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.649
 and will be under constant stirring 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.060
 brought melt 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.039
 for the water park so hot water in 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.899
 The pot, however, it should be me 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.080
 cooking and most importantly it is not allowed 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.940
 get water into the chocolate 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.470
 if she dissolved everything then the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.560
 Take a shop by the water from the water 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.550
 and allow to cool slightly 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.370
 Meanwhile, we use the ble 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.330
 cherries and cut them free 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.920
 then with the almonds 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.570
 or the need to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.610
 we have decided to mix 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.380
 Now we need a box shape with the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.970
 foil or baking paper 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.590
 Must and interpret with baking paper 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.610
 brings so many problems with it 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.480
 but there is a remedy 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 some of you will surely 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.520
 already know the baking paper so 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.130
 Just dive in water nicely 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.229
 Express and then it is 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.660
 completely malleable and that 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.690
 lay out the box shape loosely from the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.690
 hand 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.020
 Now about a quarter to a third 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.840
 the shocker crowd in the box shape 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.350
 Fill it with a layer of biscuits 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.190
 then pour in the mixture 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.240
 One then gave it to men 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.410
 showformate biscuits and such 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.320
 The conclusion then forms again 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.239
 A layer of chocolate cream now 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.100
 Cover everything with aluminum foil and over 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.440
 but at least for six hours 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.180
 I'm cold because I have my time machine 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.250
 I've been able to shoot the cold 9 so 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.959
 immediately remove it from the mold and out 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.760
 this and the paper he leaves 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.500
 Yes, then solve problem- free 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.940
 We'll die for it 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.920
 Can and is the white one 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.239
 chocolate but house was the decoration 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.950
 Of course, it does not stay that easy 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.720
 adhere 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.790
 and here comes the good old filling 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.019
 for use 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 just for a few seconds 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.380
 hold and I'll leave that in real time 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.769
 Here's a feeling for it 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.769
 gets 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.620
 The white chocolate is his 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.840
 upper layer again a small to soft 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 has become and the chocolate decoration remains now 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.460
 wonderfully stick and yes is ours 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.660
 white cold dog finished and we can 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.920
 to shape the coffee table 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.410
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.700
 preparation very good appetite and up 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.700
 bye for the next time
