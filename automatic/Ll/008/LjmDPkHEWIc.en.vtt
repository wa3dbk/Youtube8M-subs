00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.500
 continue above all because of the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.370
 next game we have to try to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.650
 return 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.660
 to make points but you know when you suffer 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.920
 too many goals and the blame is not just one 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.460
 relationship but of the whole team 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.130
 we will have to try to work to search 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.590
 to suffer fewer goals because sincerely 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 you can't really take those four 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.580
 goal away from home if you are good at it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.930
 three, however, we must try to improve 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.960
 in all departments starting with us 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 strikers up to the goalkeeper try to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 suffer fewer goals a day 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.750
 crooked however it is also true that many times 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.730
 Florentine player are gone 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 to the conclusion a little too easily 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.470
 maybe but I never like talking about gods 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 single I think unfortunately we have 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.379
 took four goals and a match that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 we want to score points 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.699
 we came from a bad defeat in the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 derby and so we had to try to do 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.050
 points and have not been able 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.720
 but now we have to think about Thursday 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.940
 to the Italian cup and then the atanta 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
 because you have to go back to doing one 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.390
 team that must grow perhaps 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.010
 personality and experience because yes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.690
 arrives here in florence they are under a 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.180
 goal and reverses the injury situation 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.520
 that it was on 2 1 but that will have to 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.650
 being a lot more I want to manage that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.290
 gala situations 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.150
 I think that this Verona until now 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.100
 despite these three defeats and is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.260
 making a great league because not 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.090
 we must never forget which is ours 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.590
 goal and where we started e 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.060
 clear that these last matches do not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.540
 they went well we must try to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.640
 improve the series, however, also this one 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.770
 the good thing is that we have 22 points and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 however, we are still sixth 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.880
 the ranking is good 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.470
 but we must be good because of it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.230
 now it is good ranking though it needs to be 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.420
 start making points because there is now 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.920
 an important challenge with the atanta 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.290
 we must return to have that malice 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.080
 that we started the championship and I think 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
 that today unlike the match col 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.780
 chievo I saw a team e 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.849
 sincerely more bad more 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.769
 eager because florence is not easy 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.239
 because they are a great team 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.980
 you think we have to start from this one 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.239
 game trying to improve not 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970
 take four goals that surely 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.570
 there are as many as the gift was 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.940
 women florence as a judge I searched 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.470
 to do everything possible for my pear 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.540
 team 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.130
 you know when he was away from home or not 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.420
 possibility of hunting matters because 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.580
 we are a team that plays a lot of 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.160
 counter-attack then tried to help i 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 my companions to pick up the team 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.330
 to do the possible then sometimes one can 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.970
 do but can not score but I think that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.980
 in the end when the game ends 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.840
 always a hundred percent therefore clear 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.970
 you can always do better though when 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.950
 one from everything is in place with conscience 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.540
 can be a double-edged sword say 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.230
 so much if we lose, however, we remain 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.840
 sestito 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.640
 no one says so much if we lose 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.200
 I only say that we have done 22 points 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.970
 no one gave them to us, nobody is this 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040
 the main thing 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.610
 we all know that the class the series a 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.959
 you can win them not with all but the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.340
 problem that then loses them with everyone in 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.690
 a series so we have to know that 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.910
 these 22 points did not give them to us 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.370
 so no one has done so far 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.380
 great things beyond all thoughts 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.180
 expectation why do 22 points up 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.890
 now they are many, but we must be 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.540
 we must tell each other that 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.850
 we must have the mentality of the first 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.560
 days we have to try to repeat today 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.780
 I think there was a mentality 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.970
 we have lost by episodes however the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.209
 team in my opinion struggled had the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.500
 right aggressive mentality I think that 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.450
 if we play like this with the atanta 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.450
 let's account here curve is back 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.600
 in my opinion it is a very good player 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.090
 important I talk to him often 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.590
 because the fortunes of this Verona 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.360
 they also spend a lot of time with him because 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.130
 it all depends on him and his head 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.230
 he is a player who is in my opinion 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.060
 very strong can be made to make the leap of 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.400
 quality only depends on him if he wants 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.890
 but desire in the sense of improving oneself 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.269
 trying to play is a player who 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.850
 definitely an added value for 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.410
 this verona and the first learns to be 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.959
 so and if it gives us a great hand first 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.060
 your experience makes you worry 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.769
 however it makes you somehow star 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.530
 quiet no no i am neither 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.420
 worried or calm 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.510
 I sincerely turn the boxes because 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.690
 for we have lost three games when 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.300
 you lose three parties I'm not calm 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.740
 but I know that we are not last in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.660
 ranking and therefore we are still one 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.190
 however, this is not a good ranking 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.710
 we must look at the ranking we must 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.510
 try to restart making points e 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.919
 try to get as soon as possible to 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.940
 40 points because our goal 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.940
 get to 40 points
