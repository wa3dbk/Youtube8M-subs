00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.700
 the national address if it is difficult 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.490
 It cost him to get involved appeared in 1927 to its protagonist 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.349
 that later this would happen already communicated 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.379
 6 35 of symbolism and lay the foundations that what we know today as 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.019
 at the beginning of the year nation 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.499
 so the lovers section the creation of characters and contribute to 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.499
 develop more credible situations the greatest visual impact 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.059
 I've heard these is to get a little more realism 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.059
 the transformation of the subjects that appears to be cocaine 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.129
 notified action consists of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.619
 prepare the viewer by a hundred to have an acceptance of we want to tell 

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:53.229
 that by its important this form we have rises to the prepared spectator the 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.449
 tense spectator alert so that nothing important in history is lost 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.940
 in this link or sixteen 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.390
 the framing or local or loader the correct placement of both the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.270
 characters like duty percent in the elements 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 who are telling the story 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.899
 so that the viewer does not miss per cent important elements of 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.899
 said story 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.260
 I give them people thing possessed the two different ways paper performances 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.530
 it consists in drawing 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.830
 frame by frame continuously his wife never possesses 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 then rae or postulate extreme positions and an option and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.909
 after its refinement that before the construction of I know that it is not 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.909
 intermediate requests 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.610
 the south pole percent and referred to that termination relationship to which the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.619
 circulation never ends abruptly 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.810
 but it ends with one in continuation in a smooth ending and what 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.340
 which raises the funding meant that no pastoral action for the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.180
 following 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 never end nation or stylize completely and start the next 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.150
 but in a bet finished nation begins the time 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
 another or several continuing actions 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.390
 Lumina does not consist of Niger makes small accelerations in celebration 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:17.579
 at its completion 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.320
 no natural option 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.650
 begins with howitzer that ends completely abruptly according to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.209
 certain cases of this blow is a pathos of more than five years according to 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.890
 finally of small 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.809
 so the cnc of celebration these small squares of celebrations 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.839
 adding the prizes awarded so much the federation is thanks to the principle 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.180
 of the end of every 100 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 another much more natural moment the magazine 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.859
 another principle are the arches no natural monument is produced in a way 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:47.789
 open 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:52.819
 it's usually all movements when we see an arm or catch mosna things do 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.459
 following finally a goal nadal counted cessation of the idea is that 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.449
 these movements that make more characters with actions 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:04.599
 these areas are emotionally existent and a route their paths that 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.599
 we are bows to get much more natural movement 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:15.139
 Nation secondary nation that is subject to another option 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.029
 for example a pigtail of a girl as the head that collection moves the as 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:21.929
 answer the moment that head 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.819
 then parking your nation's collection subject to blows 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.819
 contrary so far the head 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.370
 the training 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.150
 But movement control is more the principles that will allow us to give 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.919
 sense of state movements before options 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.159
 depending on the package in the relationship to the nation 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.459
 this action because it does not mean the other is simply with control of the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.479
 velocity of capel we are nation as a simple movement of the head by 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.140
 unions from a stroke a joyful movement a movement or sad 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.289
 dark a depressed character 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:00.849
 then that control of the movement that control over time is going to 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.849
 allow to give meaning to it because they make it after making 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.950
 the goal was to take action 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.060
 emphasize that the little appraisals to be important to tell our story 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.599
 but that will not always be that to draw all the options as a complete 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.209
 error because it could hide the federation and therefore they do not report 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.209
 history 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:29.549
 the solid mouth is a principle that in the 30s was considered 

00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:30.499
 important 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.080
 in the sense that 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.860
 ee an animator on taking network should be able to eternally capable of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.469
 very important drawing by important subject 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:40.729
 because because of a 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.770
 an animator that was able to draw a character well from all his 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.189
 postures of all your lists 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:50.149
 percent and it could give you a shorter meaning than they are 

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.800
 so much 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.680
 ep is an uncle to the character of form st 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:02.309
 finally we can say that you these principles is the main objective 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.259
 is to give personality area 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.870
 percent history a few characters were the actions 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.780
 in short what we can call the Latin elation that set of by 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.930
 cent and the correct application of all these in principles of the 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.199
 animation to get good stories to get good 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.580
 characters and ultimately to make the audience have fun watching the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.169
 three that we have 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.360
 This buildings 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.030
 those injured with the passage of time giving rise to four more have to do 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.510
 with the visual style the combination of movements the climatology and 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.809
 social animation 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:38.289
 so the techniques will allow new changes and maybe the injection 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:38.869
 the number of principles
