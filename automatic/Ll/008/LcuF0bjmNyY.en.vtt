00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
when I brought my line up around the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.100 
when I brought my line up around the
eyeball<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.700> left<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.180> little<00:02:26.390> bit<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> blank

eyeball I left a little bit of a blank
line<00:02:27.610> right<00:02:28.610> there<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:29.030> kind<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.210> adds<00:02:29.390> a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
line right there just kind of adds a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.760 
line right there just kind of adds a
little<00:02:29.630> bit<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.840> interest<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.410> breaks

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
little bit of interest to that breaks

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.650 
little bit of interest to that breaks
things<00:02:31.010> up<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.790> could<00:02:31.940> connect<00:02:32.570> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
things up but you could connect that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.480 
things up but you could connect that
line<00:02:32.720> completely<00:02:33.350> there<00:02:33.740> but<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.310> going<00:02:34.460> to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
line completely there but I'm going to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.310 
line completely there but I'm going to
go<00:02:34.610> ahead<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.940> let<00:02:35.090> when<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.780> do<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.990> coloring

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
go ahead and let when I do the coloring

go ahead and let when I do the coloring
lots<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.040> coloring<00:02:37.400> at<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.730> line<00:02:37.910> as<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> have

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390

the<00:02:38.480> white<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.840> eyes<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.830> color

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the white to the eyes and then the color

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.570 
the white to the eyes and then the color
of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.460> skin<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:42.590> next<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:42.980> going<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.250> do<00:02:43.370> is

of the skin the next I'm going to do is

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.720 
of the skin the next I'm going to do is
going<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.940> be<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> lot<00:02:44.570> more<00:02:44.780> angular<00:02:45.590> so<00:02:46.520> for

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
going to be a lot more angular so for

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.910 
going to be a lot more angular so for
this<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:47.030> I'm<00:02:47.150> almost<00:02:47.450> going<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.900> put<00:02:48.170> almost

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
this one I'm almost going to put almost

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.620 
this one I'm almost going to put almost
a<00:02:49.040> rectangle<00:02:49.760> shape<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:50.240> going<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.420> start

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
a rectangle shape I'm going to start

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.660 
a rectangle shape I'm going to start
with<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> nice<00:02:51.020> diagonal<00:02:51.530> line<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.070> then<00:02:52.550> go

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
with a nice diagonal line and then go

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.880 
with a nice diagonal line and then go
straight<00:02:52.910> across<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.810> then<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> diagonal

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
straight across and then have a diagonal

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.370 
straight across and then have a diagonal
line<00:02:55.220> down<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.090> then<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.720> almost<00:02:57.170> a

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
line down and then have almost a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.360 
line down and then have almost a
straight<00:02:57.800> line<00:02:58.070> back<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.660> very<00:03:00.080> very<00:03:00.890> angular

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
straight line back so very very angular

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.640 
straight line back so very very angular
in<00:03:01.820> comparison<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.420> our<00:03:02.660> last<00:03:02.930> eye<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.440> had

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
in comparison to our last eye that had

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.950 
in comparison to our last eye that had
just<00:03:04.010> kind<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.400> hint<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.820> angles<00:03:05.270> you<00:03:05.750> can

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
just kind of a hint of angles you can

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.130 
just kind of a hint of angles you can
sketch<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:07.360> iris<00:03:08.360> which<00:03:08.570> I'm<00:03:08.720> not<00:03:08.870> going

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
to draw the full circle um and have it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.830 
to draw the full circle um and have it
hidden<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.240> little<00:03:11.360> bit<00:03:11.600> under<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:11.900> top<00:03:12.260> lid

didn't<00:06:13.830> place<00:06:13.980> my<00:06:14.160> people<00:06:14.490> dead<00:06:14.700> center<00:06:15.090> I

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
didn't place my people dead center I

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.420 
didn't place my people dead center I
placed<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.810> a<00:06:16.020> little<00:06:16.500> bit<00:06:16.620> closer<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.220> higher

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
placed it a little bit closer and higher

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.190 
placed it a little bit closer and higher
up<00:06:17.700> that's<00:06:18.360> going<00:06:18.510> to<00:06:18.600> give<00:06:18.720> a<00:06:18.750> little<00:06:18.960> bit<00:06:19.110> of

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
up that's going to give a little bit of

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.010 
up that's going to give a little bit of
an<00:06:19.290> illusion<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.830> the<00:06:20.280> circle<00:06:20.790> is<00:06:20.940> round<00:06:21.240> so

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
an illusion that the circle is round so

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.690 
an illusion that the circle is round so
that<00:06:22.320> this<00:06:22.500> part<00:06:22.830> of<00:06:22.920> the<00:06:22.980> circle<00:06:23.310> is<00:06:23.370> closer

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
that this part of the circle is closer

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.520 
that this part of the circle is closer
to<00:06:23.970> us<00:06:24.120> while<00:06:24.300> this<00:06:24.450> is<00:06:24.600> wrapping<00:06:25.140> around<00:06:25.230> a

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
to us while this is wrapping around a

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.260 
to us while this is wrapping around a
little<00:06:25.620> bit<00:06:25.800> further<00:06:26.070> away<00:06:26.250> so<00:06:26.940> by<00:06:27.060> placing

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
little bit further away so by placing

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.840 
little bit further away so by placing
this<00:06:27.630> iris<00:06:28.200> a<00:06:28.470> little<00:06:28.950> bit<00:06:29.100> over<00:06:29.400> to<00:06:29.520> one<00:06:29.610> side

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
this iris a little bit over to one side

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.330 
this iris a little bit over to one side
and<00:06:30.500> making<00:06:31.500> this<00:06:31.710> a<00:06:31.770> little<00:06:31.920> too<00:06:32.070> small<00:06:32.220> it

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
and making this a little too small it

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.280 
and making this a little too small it
makes<00:06:32.490> it<00:06:32.610> look<00:06:32.820> like<00:06:32.850> this<00:06:33.270> is<00:06:33.540> wrapping

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
makes it look like this is wrapping

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:43.670 
makes it look like this is wrapping
around<00:06:39.200> nice<00:06:40.200> thick<00:06:40.500> but<00:06:40.710> short<00:06:41.070> one<00:06:42.560> now<00:06:43.560> when

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
around nice thick but short one now when

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.110 
around nice thick but short one now when
they<00:06:43.770> inked<00:06:43.950> this<00:06:44.190> I<00:06:44.370> want<00:06:44.640> you<00:06:44.820> want<00:06:44.970> to<00:06:45.000> keep
