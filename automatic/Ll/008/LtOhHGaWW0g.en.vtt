00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.540 
exactly quite convenient to like it
takes<00:02:03.080> like<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.290> year<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.590> make<00:02:03.710> movie<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.310> the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
takes like a year to make movie and the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.040 
takes like a year to make movie and the
year<00:02:04.790> for<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.000> Hogwarts<00:02:05.150> year<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:05.810> it's<00:02:05.930> like

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
year for the Hogwarts year so it's like

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.300 
year for the Hogwarts year so it's like
we're<00:02:06.260> growing<00:02:06.380> up<00:02:06.680> with<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.890> books<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
we're growing up with the books and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.859 
we're growing up with the books and
we're<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.700> up<00:02:07.820> with<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.119> film<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.720> it's

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
we're going up with the film so it's

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.500 
we're going up with the film so it's
kind<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.200> makes<00:02:10.190> sense<00:02:10.310> good<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.030> want<00:02:11.210> to<00:02:11.300> see
