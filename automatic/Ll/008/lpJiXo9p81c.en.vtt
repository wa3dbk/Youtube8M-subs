00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
like design this frame but I

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.400 
like design this frame but I
like<00:00:56.129> changed<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.120> bit<00:00:57.269> I<00:00:57.570> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
like changed it a little bit I I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
like changed it a little bit I I
shortened<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.789> backend<00:01:00.179> and<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.629> Roman<00:01:03.629> girl

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
shortened the backend and the Roman girl

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
shortened the backend and the Roman girl
is<00:01:03.839> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.110> bit<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.470> steep<00:01:04.769> than<00:01:05.119> Dennis's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
is a little bit more steep than Dennis's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
is a little bit more steep than Dennis's
friend<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.540> seventy<00:01:07.229> five<00:01:07.409> point<00:01:07.619> five<00:01:07.860> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
friend it's seventy five point five so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.550 
friend it's seventy five point five so
the<00:01:08.790> frame<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.149> more<00:01:09.720> responsive<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the frame is just more responsive and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
the frame is just more responsive and
it's<00:01:11.430> easier<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.330> tricks<00:01:12.539> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> front

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it's easier to do tricks on the front

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.590 
it's easier to do tricks on the front
row<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.190> change<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.119> tapered

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
row the the change they are are tapered

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
row the the change they are are tapered
so<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> doesn't<00:01:16.380> help<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:17.130> feet<00:01:17.399> when<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so it doesn't help my my feet when I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.469 
so it doesn't help my my feet when I
write<00:01:17.850> flatland<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> frame<00:01:21.030> under

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
write flatland and so the frame under

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.710 
write flatland and so the frame under
the<00:01:21.720> fork<00:01:21.960> both<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.390> really<00:01:24.390> wanted<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the fork both of them I really wanted a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.460 
the fork both of them I really wanted a
steep<00:01:25.399> from<00:01:26.399> end<00:01:26.689> to<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.840> tricks<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
steep from end to do like tricks on the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.350 
steep from end to do like tricks on the
front<00:01:28.679> wheel<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.069> it's<00:01:29.550> seventy<00:01:29.970> five<00:01:30.179> point

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
front wheel and it's seventy five point

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.440 
front wheel and it's seventy five point
five<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:31.289> really<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:31.909> much<00:01:32.909> more<00:01:33.119> easy<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
five it's really like much more easy to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.109 
five it's really like much more easy to
do<00:01:33.539> not<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.319> a<00:01:34.350> steep<00:01:34.830> frame<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.399> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
do not really with a steep frame I just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:36.950 
do not really with a steep frame I just
I<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.330> love<00:01:36.690> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
