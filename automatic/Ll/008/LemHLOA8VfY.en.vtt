00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
second so I decided instead of instead

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.920 
second so I decided instead of instead
of<00:01:42.410> using<00:01:42.800> like<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.760> comb<00:01:44.060> piece<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.810> blow

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
of using like the comb piece on the blow

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.890 
of using like the comb piece on the blow
dryer<00:01:45.140> or<00:01:45.260> whatever<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.950> blow<00:01:46.130> dry<00:01:46.510> this<00:01:47.510> part

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.080 
dryer or whatever to blow dry this part
of<00:01:48.050> my<00:01:48.200> hair<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:48.500> didn't<00:01:48.950> want<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.250> dry<00:01:49.460> under

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
of my hair that didn't want to dry under

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.219 
of my hair that didn't want to dry under
the<00:01:50.830> hooded<00:01:51.830> dryer<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.490> decided<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:54.520> just<00:01:55.520> go

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229

the hooded dryer I decided to just go
like<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.830> just<00:01:57.920> wait<00:01:58.369> till<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.700> dries

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940

same direction as your rap so if you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.140 
same direction as your rap so if you
brushed<00:04:11.750> your<00:04:12.050> hair<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.250> right<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.940> wrap

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
brushed your hair to the right to wrap

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.710

it then you're going to wrap the saran
wrap<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.380> right<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:20.270> just<00:04:20.540> you<00:04:21.140> know

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.870 
wrap to the right that just you know
makes<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.070> guess<00:04:22.220> it<00:04:22.370> makes<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.730> better

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
makes it I guess it makes it better

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.850 
makes it I guess it makes it better
because<00:04:23.150> it's<00:04:23.540> like<00:04:23.750> everything's<00:04:24.620> just

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
because it's like everything's just

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.630 
because it's like everything's just
working<00:04:26.440> going<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> same<00:04:27.920> direction<00:04:27.980> and

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
working going in the same direction and

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.410 
working going in the same direction and
everything<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:30.670> yeah<00:04:31.670> after<00:04:32.000> all<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.300> are

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
everything and yeah after all you are

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.530 
everything and yeah after all you are
trying<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.720> get<00:04:32.810> your<00:04:32.960> hair<00:04:33.080> straight<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:33.950> um

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
trying to get your hair straight so um

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.110 
trying to get your hair straight so um
that<00:04:35.540> could<00:04:35.720> only<00:04:35.810> help<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.680> think<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.850> wrapped

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
that could only help I think I wrapped

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.840 
that could only help I think I wrapped
it<00:04:38.210> around<00:04:38.300> maybe<00:04:38.750> three<00:04:39.080> or<00:04:39.110> four<00:04:39.470> times<00:04:39.770> um<00:04:40.460> I

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
it around maybe three or four times um I

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.060 
it around maybe three or four times um I
guess<00:04:41.270> just<00:04:41.450> do<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.780> until<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.200> feel<00:04:42.500> secure

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
guess just do it until you feel secure

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.240 
guess just do it until you feel secure
and<00:04:43.100> until<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.030> feels<00:04:44.270> secure<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:45.050> think<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.100> did

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
and until it feels secure I think I did

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.550 
and until it feels secure I think I did
mine<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.460> little<00:04:46.640> tight<00:04:47.210> but<00:04:47.570> um<00:04:47.900> I<00:04:48.640> think

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
mine a little tight but um I think

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.740 
mine a little tight but um I think
that's<00:04:51.560> pretty<00:04:52.250> much<00:04:52.490> all<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:53.000> need<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.570> know

then you just rip off the UM the little
bar<00:04:58.430> thing<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.060> then<00:04:59.210> you're<00:04:59.480> good<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.810> go<00:05:03.730> so
