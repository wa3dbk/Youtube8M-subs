quilting project we're ready to finish
up<00:00:13.120> our<00:00:13.330> motif<00:00:13.930> my<00:00:14.320> stitching<00:00:14.770> around<00:00:15.010> it<00:00:15.520> with

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
up our motif my stitching around it with

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.510 
up our motif my stitching around it with
a<00:00:15.730> very<00:00:16.090> dense<00:00:16.570> design<00:00:17.200> and<00:00:17.770> this<00:00:18.070> is<00:00:18.130> called

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
a very dense design and this is called

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.570 
a very dense design and this is called
jagged<00:00:19.150> scribble<00:00:19.780> it's<00:00:20.410> basically<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.400> same

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
jagged scribble it's basically the same

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.240 
jagged scribble it's basically the same
idea<00:00:21.970> of<00:00:22.240> cat<00:00:22.990> hair<00:00:23.260> ball<00:00:23.470> filler<00:00:23.740> on<00:00:23.950> a<00:00:23.980> very

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
idea of cat hair ball filler on a very

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.110 
idea of cat hair ball filler on a very
dense<00:00:24.550> scale<00:00:24.970> it's<00:00:25.810> kind<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.170> that<00:00:26.290> same<00:00:26.500> idea

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
dense scale it's kind of that same idea

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.660 
dense scale it's kind of that same idea
over<00:00:28.120> lapping<00:00:28.690> and<00:00:29.260> building<00:00:29.890> up<00:00:30.040> texture<00:00:30.550> and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
over lapping and building up texture and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.940 
over lapping and building up texture and
almost<00:00:31.090> thread<00:00:31.360> painting<00:00:31.630> only<00:00:32.619> with<00:00:32.829> this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
almost thread painting only with this

almost thread painting only with this
particular<00:00:33.309> design<00:00:33.879> we're<00:00:34.210> using<00:00:34.420> jagged

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
particular design we're using jagged

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.619 
particular design we're using jagged
scribbly<00:00:36.040> lines<00:00:36.309> lost<00:00:36.820> straight<00:00:37.180> lines<00:00:37.390> lot

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
scribbly lines lost straight lines lot

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.020 
scribbly lines lost straight lines lot
of<00:00:37.690> sharp<00:00:37.989> angles<00:00:38.499> and<00:00:38.739> this<00:00:39.339> is<00:00:39.519> a<00:00:39.550> really

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
of sharp angles and this is a really

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.729 
of sharp angles and this is a really
good<00:00:40.179> design<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.839> practice<00:00:41.350> straight<00:00:41.559> lines

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
good design to practice straight lines

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.139 
good design to practice straight lines
and<00:00:41.920> sharp<00:00:42.129> angles<00:00:42.489> if<00:00:42.579> that's<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.879> struggle

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
and sharp angles if that's a struggle

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.970 
and sharp angles if that's a struggle
for<00:00:43.300> you<00:00:43.539> so<00:00:43.989> let's<00:00:44.170> get<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.530> machine<00:00:44.829> and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
for you so let's get on the machine and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.560 
for you so let's get on the machine and
see<00:00:45.129> how<00:00:45.249> this<00:00:45.399> works<00:00:45.640> in<00:00:45.850> free<00:00:46.059> motion<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.510> you

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
see how this works in free motion so you

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.860 
see how this works in free motion so you
can<00:00:50.019> see<00:00:50.260> how<00:00:50.649> much<00:00:50.920> I<00:00:51.219> filled<00:00:51.640> within<00:00:52.480> this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
can see how much I filled within this

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.979 
can see how much I filled within this
area<00:00:53.409> I<00:00:53.739> have<00:00:54.280> marked<00:00:54.699> these<00:00:54.969> motifs<00:00:55.539> I've

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
area I have marked these motifs I've

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.349 
area I have marked these motifs I've
stitched<00:00:56.379> around<00:00:56.649> them<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.519> even<00:00:57.699> started<00:00:58.210> to

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
stitched around them and even started to

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.200 
stitched around them and even started to
fill<00:00:58.690> with<00:00:59.409> this<00:00:59.589> jagged<00:00:59.949> scribble<00:01:00.640> let<00:01:01.089> me

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
fill with this jagged scribble let me

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.350 
fill with this jagged scribble let me
zoom<00:01:01.449> in<00:01:02.010> we're<00:01:03.010> gonna<00:01:03.159> get<00:01:03.339> started<00:01:03.760> about

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
zoom in we're gonna get started about

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.260 
zoom in we're gonna get started about
right<00:01:04.780> here<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.470> really<00:01:06.430> it's<00:01:06.550> entirely<00:01:06.970> up

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
right here and really it's entirely up

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.260 
right here and really it's entirely up
to<00:01:07.300> you<00:01:07.659> how<00:01:08.050> complex<00:01:08.770> your<00:01:09.250> motifs<00:01:09.759> become

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
to you how complex your motifs become

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.030 
to you how complex your motifs become
I'm<00:01:10.930> going<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.229> get<00:01:11.320> started<00:01:11.619> here<00:01:11.829> and<00:01:11.979> I'm

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
I'm going to get started here and I'm

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.560 
I'm going to get started here and I'm
going<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.189> continue<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.850> same<00:01:13.119> design

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
going to continue that same design

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.800 
going to continue that same design
working<00:01:14.229> through<00:01:14.740> this<00:01:14.920> space<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.689> is

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
working through this space but it is

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.810 
working through this space but it is
entirely<00:01:17.200> up<00:01:17.439> to<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:17.890> how<00:01:18.130> complex<00:01:18.579> your

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
entirely up to you how complex your

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.039 
entirely up to you how complex your
motifs<00:01:19.270> are<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.189> don't<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.789> do<00:01:21.969> so<00:01:22.750> many

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
motifs are you don't have to do so many

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.560 
motifs are you don't have to do so many
lines<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.590> quilting<00:01:24.009> within<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.430> space<00:01:24.729> you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
lines of quilting within a space you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.929 
lines of quilting within a space you
don't<00:01:25.659> have<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.350> fill<00:01:26.619> with<00:01:27.039> this<00:01:27.250> dense<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.850> a

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
builds up the thread just a little bit

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.970 
builds up the thread just a little bit
through<00:02:10.879> those<00:02:11.030> areas<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.750> then<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.799> go<00:02:12.950> back

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
through those areas and then I go back

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.460 
through those areas and then I go back
to<00:02:13.190> filling<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.599> just<00:02:14.810> gonna<00:02:14.930> alternate

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
to filling and I just gonna alternate

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.670 
to filling and I just gonna alternate
between<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.920> two<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.780> reason<00:02:17.959> being<00:02:18.410> is

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
between the two and the reason being is

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
between the two and the reason being is
it<00:02:18.829> just<00:02:19.069> I<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.060> looks<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.390> little<00:02:20.540> bit

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
it just I think it looks a little bit

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.390 
it just I think it looks a little bit
better<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.140> think<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.530> builds<00:02:21.860> up<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.129> line

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
better I think it builds up that line

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.059 
better I think it builds up that line
makes<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.910> stand<00:02:23.150> out<00:02:23.420> even<00:02:23.480> more<00:02:23.890> makes<00:02:24.890> a

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
makes it stand out even more makes a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.599 
makes it stand out even more makes a
very<00:02:25.430> bold<00:02:26.359> statement<00:02:27.160> between<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.310> filler

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
very bold statement between the filler

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.039 
very bold statement between the filler
design<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:31.579> actual<00:02:31.940> a-team<00:02:32.390> mix<00:02:32.900> that

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
design and the actual a-team mix that

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.039 
design and the actual a-team mix that
motif<00:02:33.349> just<00:02:33.680> pop<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:33.920> much<00:02:34.310> more<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.870> can

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
motif just pop that much more you can

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.809 
motif just pop that much more you can
see<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.440> I'm<00:02:36.560> keeping<00:02:36.769> this<00:02:37.129> a<00:02:37.190> lot<00:02:37.579> more

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
see that I'm keeping this a lot more

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.809 
see that I'm keeping this a lot more
open<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:39.590> they<00:02:39.950> can't<00:02:40.190> hear<00:02:40.430> about<00:02:40.489> filler

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
open then they can't hear about filler

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.789 
open then they can't hear about filler
we<00:02:41.060> learned<00:02:41.269> earlier<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.810> year<00:02:42.049> I'm<00:02:42.440> really

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
we learned earlier this year I'm really

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.520 
we learned earlier this year I'm really
not<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.700> thread<00:02:43.970> painting<00:02:44.299> I<00:02:44.900> want

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
not going for thread painting I want

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.789 
not going for thread painting I want
this<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.190> fill<00:02:46.639> that<00:02:47.450> fills<00:02:47.870> densely<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
this to be a fill that fills densely and

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.879 
this to be a fill that fills densely and
tight<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.639> that<00:02:50.359> might<00:02:50.569> I<00:02:50.810> get<00:02:50.870> some<00:02:51.230> puffs<00:02:51.500> in

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
tight so that might I get some puffs in

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.430 
tight so that might I get some puffs in
my<00:02:52.160> motif<00:02:52.579> but<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.209> don't<00:02:53.450> want<00:02:53.660> it<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.109> dense

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
my motif but I don't want it so dense

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.009 
my motif but I don't want it so dense
and<00:02:54.680> tight<00:02:54.919> that<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.370> area<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:55.819> goes<00:02:56.209> white

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
and tight that this area just goes white

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.140 
and tight that this area just goes white
with<00:02:57.290> thread<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.400> basically<00:02:58.489> looks<00:02:59.090> like

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
with thread and it basically looks like

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.580 
with thread and it basically looks like
I've<00:02:59.389> just<00:02:59.569> straight<00:02:59.810> painted<00:03:00.260> through<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
I've just straight painted through the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.440 
I've just straight painted through the
area<00:03:00.919> I<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.099> want<00:03:01.519> bad<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.760> want<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> leave

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
area I don't want bad I want to leave

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.890 
area I don't want bad I want to leave
some<00:03:02.720> gaps<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:03.200> those

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
some gaps in those

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.740 
some gaps in those
and<00:03:04.019> really<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.980> best<00:03:05.160> advice<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:06.209> going

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
and really the best advice is just going

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.920 
and really the best advice is just going
to<00:03:06.810> fill<00:03:07.170> through<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> area<00:03:08.420> and<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:09.690> there's

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
to fill through the area and if there's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.710 
to fill through the area and if there's
anything<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.290> seems<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.980> open<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> go

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
anything that seems to open to you go

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.430 
anything that seems to open to you go
back<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> throw<00:03:13.440> some<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:13.800> thread<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.280> it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
back in and throw some more thread in it

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.320 
back in and throw some more thread in it
it's<00:03:16.440> not<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.650> tricky<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.700> if<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.150> an

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
it's not that tricky and if you have an

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.570 
it's not that tricky and if you have an
area<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.750> seems<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.379> too<00:03:20.010> built<00:03:20.280> up

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
area that seems like it's too built up

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.190 
area that seems like it's too built up
don't<00:03:20.790> worry<00:03:20.970> about<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.599> know<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.900> this

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
don't worry about it you know this this

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.539 
don't worry about it you know this this
is<00:03:22.260> one<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> those<00:03:22.709> fills<00:03:23.010> that's<00:03:23.250> very

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
is one of those fills that's very

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.449 
is one of those fills that's very
forgiving<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:25.110> only<00:03:25.500> struggle<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.310> you'll

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
forgiving the only struggle that you'll

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.089 
forgiving the only struggle that you'll
probably<00:03:26.730> have<00:03:27.299> with<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.930> honestly<00:03:28.530> moving

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
probably have with it is honestly moving

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.009 
probably have with it is honestly moving
too<00:03:29.310> quickly<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.120> stitch<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:30.569> on<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> big

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
too quickly if you stitch this on a big

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.960 
too quickly if you stitch this on a big
scale<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.459> quilt<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.849> very<00:03:33.120> fast<00:03:34.970> it's

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
scale and you quilt it very fast it's

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.440 
scale and you quilt it very fast it's
very<00:03:36.090> easy<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:37.430> get<00:03:38.430> really<00:03:38.849> big<00:03:39.060> stitches

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
very easy to get really big stitches

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.430 
very easy to get really big stitches
with<00:03:39.569> this<00:03:39.690> because<00:03:39.900> it's<00:03:40.230> such<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
with this because it's such a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.870 
with this because it's such a
comfortable<00:03:41.069> movement

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
comfortable movement

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.140 
comfortable movement
it's<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.329> scribbling<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.989> it's<00:03:43.319> just

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
it's just scribbling it's it's just

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
it's just scribbling it's it's just
overlapping<00:03:45.150> you're<00:03:45.480> not<00:03:45.599> trying<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.989> hit

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
overlapping you're not trying to hit

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.960 
overlapping you're not trying to hit
lines<00:03:46.440> you're<00:03:46.769> just<00:03:46.920> trying<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.220> stay<00:03:47.670> within

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
lines you're just trying to stay within

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.020 
lines you're just trying to stay within
the<00:03:48.180> space<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.769> very<00:03:50.069> very<00:03:50.400> easy<00:03:50.670> and

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the space so it is very very easy and

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.030 
the space so it is very very easy and
that<00:03:51.480> means<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.140> very<00:03:52.349> easy<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.769> kind

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that means that it's very easy to kind

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.039 
that means that it's very easy to kind
of<00:03:53.160> go<00:03:53.250> out<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.519> control<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.840> just

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
of go out of control of it so just

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.860 
of go out of control of it so just
remember<00:03:55.379> that<00:03:55.920> your<00:03:56.549> hands<00:03:57.030> have<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.239> stay<00:03:57.390> in

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
remember that your hands have to stay in

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.619 
remember that your hands have to stay in
tune<00:03:58.230> with<00:03:59.010> your<00:03:59.069> foot<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.670> ratio<00:03:59.940> has<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.480> be

tune with your foot that ratio has to be

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.770 
tune with your foot that ratio has to be
the<00:04:00.750> same<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:02.190> no<00:04:02.670> matter<00:04:02.879> how<00:04:03.120> fast<00:04:03.450> you're

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
the same so no matter how fast you're

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.180 
the same so no matter how fast you're
stitching<00:04:04.079> just<00:04:04.620> make<00:04:04.769> sure<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:04.980> you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
stitching just make sure that you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.660 
stitching just make sure that you
maintain<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.610> nice<00:04:05.819> balance<00:04:06.329> between<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.810> two

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
maintain a nice balance between the two

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.490 
maintain a nice balance between the two
I'm<00:04:08.060> just<00:04:08.420> about<00:04:08.690> finished<00:04:09.080> up<00:04:09.230> with<00:04:09.349> this

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
I'm just about finished up with this

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.839 
I'm just about finished up with this
area

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.090 

and<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.420> basically<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.259> don't<00:04:16.440> really<00:04:16.799> work

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
and so basically I don't really work

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.469 
and so basically I don't really work
through<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.459> with<00:04:17.639> any<00:04:17.820> rhyme<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.299> reason

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
through this with any rhyme and reason

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.870 
through this with any rhyme and reason
you<00:04:18.930> can<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.259> that<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.500> kind<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.799> bounced<00:04:20.669> all

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you can see that I kind of bounced all

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.540 
you can see that I kind of bounced all
around<00:04:21.449> this<00:04:21.720> particular<00:04:21.989> space<00:04:22.800> as<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.220> filled

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.689 
it and that's perfectly fine because
this<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.270> all<00:04:27.710> outlined<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.070> stitched<00:04:29.370> it's
