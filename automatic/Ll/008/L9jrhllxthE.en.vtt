00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.040
 four people from the crafting staff 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.759
 mine 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.759
 and they go 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.360
 pike 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.449
 ruben 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.670
 and emi meet to discuss some of 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.029
 the existential doubts about minecraft 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.029
 this is let's talk without crafter 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.099
 hello and welcome is a new program 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.450
 Let's talk without crafter in the program 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.890
 today we are going to analyze one of the doubts 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.350
 they had some of our 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.950
 subscribers and it's because they exploit 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.170
 flu 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 we are surrounded by a panel of experts 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.160
 three very particular characters that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.230
 they know a lot about the subject one of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 they gm in me how are you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 had about it and well I eat 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.830
 kripper tamer of the zoo of the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.930
 island in epc the south Atlantic I can 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.360
 to comment on them and to inform me 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.729
 a lot and I came to the conclusion after 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.140
 to inform me enough that the 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.320
 clippers in the Second World War 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.330
 they were kamikaze and japan soldiers who 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.909
 they recruited several soldiers to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 make them give their enemies and one 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.409
 of them he learned the technique and he used it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.670
 between generations and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 teach all the clippers to do 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.650
 this another one of the experts that is in 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 our table is ivÃ¡n let's ask him 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.090
 what do you think 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 good hollis look at me as coaches 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.399
 I was talking with pig 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 on the subject that is not as much as it says 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.609
 that they were from the moon they lived next 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.700
 flying benitez then session so 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.700
 friends that work plants 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.350
 It was filling inside and when it came 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.979
 on a cigarette they traveled through the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.979
 speed of light 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.880
 because the clippers use cell 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.880
 because it 's cold because it's calling 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.720
 i 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.290
 I recently finished my thesis because the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.950
 gases leave a tear on the finger not 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.720
 there is water and the truth is that I was 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.580
 thinking well and I think they have a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.650
 psychological problem the Christs because 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.810
 if you analyze any individual 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.730
 who wants to commit suicide always wants 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 hurting yourself does not want you 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.390
 harm to others and in the case 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.980
 crips but when suicide is out 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.989
 harm to others and even the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.700
 natures it seems to me that if we want 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.260
 change in behavior in it we have 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.209
 to work is that they are very 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.880
 small to solve it 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.650
 really allusion there is no work 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.989
 a lot on the subject because like everyone 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.280
 we know the egg inscribers green 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.019
 because it's something from nature but if 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.840
 we can see has those manchester 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.209
 black that even the creator of the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.660
 clipper in the most intimate offices 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.310
 they mold show in those little spots all 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.650
 the badness of the clipper 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.690
 towards society towards the world towards 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.390
 the nature the contempt of them 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.370
 we know that the clippers in their stage of 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.620
 childhood are autistic and they hate all 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.100
 society people just do not have to 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.410
 analyze anything because 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.630
 thanks to your egg that exists and are born 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.260
 that way they will live like this and they will die like this 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.780
 hating society 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.500
 because the three of them are so good 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.519
 continents because because it makes good 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.519
 Dad's twine 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.150
 well they were going to some opinion about what 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.150
 said m 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.920
 Ah good 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.209
 good in me I do not know if you want to say something 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.680
 plus 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.990
 and well then we know what 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.020
 the clippers are green because if the 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.710
 pigs are pink and white hens 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.710
 they had to be green 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 Do you have any opinion 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.410
 I now understand why I serves as a point 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.410
 of defender 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.959
 and favorite television 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.820
 m 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.739
 good one of the things that I also 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.950
 I have as a theory is that the crypts 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.200
 Ghana protest mode explosions 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.810
 because I can not think 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.430
 greenville are green and evenings 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.810
 save green things but the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.940
 clippers do not save them then the 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.950
 clippers protest against him greenpeace 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.990
 and how they do it by exploiting what 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.850
 greenpeace protects what nature is 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.440
 so I think they explode for that 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.540
 to claim greenpeace that the 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
 take care of them also then like that 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.610
 they have a shared hatred with those of 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.139
 sell me since I did not wash them and 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.120
 to the teams he defends them then 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.250
 they have a shared hatred between the two 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.020
 towards the greenpeace and if you add the 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.449
 zombies that are also green we think 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.240
 that the grip and we have plenty of air 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.099
 without equal what we are going to do is not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.809
 The subject of us here is speaking 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.689
 of other things we are to analyze 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:16.900
