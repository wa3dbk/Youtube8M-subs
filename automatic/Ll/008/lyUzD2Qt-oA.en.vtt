to<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> buzz<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
to them it's not like a buzz or a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.499 
to them it's not like a buzz or a
high-pitched<00:01:50.220> squeal<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> weird

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
high-pitched squeal it's just a weird

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.789 
high-pitched squeal it's just a weird
hum<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:51.990> they're<00:01:52.110> running<00:01:52.229> even<00:01:52.560> at<00:01:52.649> low

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hum when they're running even at low

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.910 
hum when they're running even at low
rpms<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.149> keep<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.479> mind<00:01:54.920> when

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
rpms so I just keep that in mind when

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.780 
rpms so I just keep that in mind when
you're<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.250> you're<00:01:56.369> worried<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.549> noise

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you're if you're worried about noise

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.899 
you're if you're worried about noise
which<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.270> am<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> might<00:01:57.960> replace<00:01:58.259> these<00:01:58.500> with

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
which I am so I might replace these with

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.590 
which I am so I might replace these with
Silverstone<00:01:59.909> air<00:02:00.090> penetrator<00:02:00.630> fans<00:02:00.990> or

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
Silverstone air penetrator fans or

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.950 
Silverstone air penetrator fans or
scythe<00:02:03.649> gentle<00:02:04.649> typhoons<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> here's<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the power state Corsair power supplies

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.450 
the power state Corsair power supplies
and<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.780> three<00:02:16.050> pins<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.890> so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
and they have three pins on here and so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.250 
and they have three pins on here and so
next<00:02:17.610> we're<00:02:17.820> taking<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.030> look<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.690> water

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
next we're taking a look at the water

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.120 
next we're taking a look at the water
hotel<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> here's<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.720> heat<00:02:21.900> sink<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:23.070> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
hotel so here's the heat sink it's a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.430 
hotel so here's the heat sink it's a
pretty<00:02:23.280> big<00:02:23.460> heat<00:02:23.580> sink<00:02:23.610> 120-millimeter<00:02:24.450> fans

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
pretty big heat sink 120-millimeter fans

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.340 
pretty big heat sink 120-millimeter fans
go<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.330> some<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> fins<00:02:27.660> did<00:02:27.900> come<00:02:28.140> when

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
go on it some of the fins did come when

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.080 
go on it some of the fins did come when
it<00:02:28.440> shipped<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:29.160> little<00:02:29.490> bit<00:02:29.580> bent<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:29.970> not

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it shipped a little bit bent but not

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.270 
it shipped a little bit bent but not
terribly<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.710> straight<00:02:32.250> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
terribly just a little not straight I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.310 
terribly just a little not straight I
guess<00:02:32.550> they're<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> little<00:02:32.880> little<00:02:33.570> wavy<00:02:33.720> but

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
guess they're a little little wavy but

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.630 
guess they're a little little wavy but
again<00:02:34.500> they're<00:02:34.710> they<00:02:35.040> weren't<00:02:35.310> bent<00:02:35.520> or

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
again they're they weren't bent or

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460 
again they're they weren't bent or
crushed<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.240> I'm<00:02:36.330> not<00:02:36.450> too<00:02:36.600> concerned<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:37.290> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
crushed so I'm not too concerned if you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.530 
crushed so I'm not too concerned if you
are<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:38.040> if<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.790> get<00:02:38.940> them<00:02:39.060> into<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> little

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
are that if you get them into a little

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.790 
are that if you get them into a little
bent<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.080> could<00:02:40.200> strain<00:02:40.410> them<00:02:40.530> out<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.740> it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
bent you could strain them out and it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.350 
bent you could strain them out and it
won't<00:02:40.860> affect<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.220> too<00:02:41.400> much<00:02:41.550> it's<00:02:41.970> got<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> car

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
won't affect it too much it's got a car

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.520 
won't affect it too much it's got a car
right<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.630> basically<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.290> strain

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
right here basically and you can strain

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.170 
right here basically and you can strain
them<00:02:43.650> out<00:02:43.740> so<00:02:43.950> I'm<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> huge<00:02:44.340> deal<00:02:44.490> just<00:02:44.670> don't

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
them out so I'm a huge deal just don't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.700 
them out so I'm a huge deal just don't
bend<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:46.020> whole<00:02:46.530> lot

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.820 
bend it a whole lot
-<00:02:47.700> don't<00:02:47.850> minute<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> lot<00:02:48.210> a<00:02:48.240> lot<00:02:48.440> see<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.590> holes

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
- don't minute a lot a lot see the holes

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.290 
- don't minute a lot a lot see the holes
here<00:02:50.040> string<00:02:50.460> that's<00:02:50.580> most<00:02:50.940> them<00:02:51.090> already

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
here string that's most them already

it's not bad alright so here's the
bottom<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> pump<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.760> cold<00:02:57.090> plate

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
bottom of the pump it's the cold plate

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.390 
bottom of the pump it's the cold plate
it's<00:02:57.780> looks<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.320> it's<00:02:58.500> solid<00:02:58.680> copper<00:02:59.190> with

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it's looks like it's solid copper with

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.300 
it's looks like it's solid copper with
thermal<00:02:59.910> paste<00:03:00.060> already<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.860> placed<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.190> I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
thermal paste already and placed on it I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.310 
thermal paste already and placed on it I
will<00:03:02.670> mostly<00:03:02.940> take<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.270> off<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:04.170> put<00:03:04.290> some

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
will mostly take this off and put some

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.960 
will mostly take this off and put some
arctic<00:03:04.680> silver<00:03:04.830> on<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.310> heard<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.760> this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
arctic silver on I have heard that this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.080 
arctic silver on I have heard that this
is<00:03:06.090> actually<00:03:06.360> pretty<00:03:06.780> decent<00:03:07.160> water<00:03:08.160> thermal

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
is actually pretty decent water thermal

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.460 
is actually pretty decent water thermal
paste<00:03:09.209> but<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> haven't<00:03:09.930> tested<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.410> I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
paste but I haven't tested it and I

don't<00:03:29.130> remember<00:03:29.310> off<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.610> top<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.850> my<00:03:30.060> head

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
don't remember off the top of my head

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.030 
don't remember off the top of my head
you<00:03:30.780> can<00:03:30.900> control<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.320> speed<00:03:31.620> they<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.739> with

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you can control what speed they are with

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.890 
you can control what speed they are with
this<00:03:32.130> little<00:03:32.310> button<00:03:32.370> right<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.700> middle

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
this little button right in the middle

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.110 
this little button right in the middle
it's<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:34.080> cool<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:35.550> can<00:03:35.670> also<00:03:35.820> get<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
it's that's cool you can also get the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.300 
it's that's cool you can also get the
you<00:03:36.450> also<00:03:36.780> need<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.080> include<00:03:37.290> plug<00:03:37.980> these<00:03:38.130> in

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
you also need to include plug these in

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.240 
you also need to include plug these in
for<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.239> molex<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.290> just<00:03:40.560> got<00:03:40.739> two<00:03:40.890> pins<00:03:41.100> in

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
for one molex I just got two pins in

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.920 
for one molex I just got two pins in
there<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.550> it's<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.760> normal<00:03:42.300> standard<00:03:42.600> molex

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
there but it's a normal standard molex

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.120 
there but it's a normal standard molex
and<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.800> three<00:03:44.730> pin<00:03:45.060> motherboard<00:03:45.600> power<00:03:46.130> that's

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
and a three pin motherboard power that's

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.970 
and a three pin motherboard power that's
to<00:03:47.280> control<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.610> voltage<00:03:47.760> I<00:03:48.030> guess<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:49.800> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
to control the voltage I guess on the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.710 
to control the voltage I guess on the
top<00:03:50.160> here<00:03:50.489> there<00:03:51.090> are<00:03:51.390> two<00:03:51.890> four<00:03:52.890> pin<00:03:53.720> fan

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
top here there are two four pin fan

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.870 
top here there are two four pin fan
connectors<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.950> fans<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.280> come<00:03:56.430> with<00:03:56.640> that

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
connectors the fans that come with that

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.670 
connectors the fans that come with that
come<00:03:57.000> with<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.390> pump<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:58.080> only<00:03:58.200> three<00:03:58.470> pins

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
come with the pump are only three pins

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.120 
come with the pump are only three pins
but<00:03:58.950> they<00:03:59.459> will<00:03:59.640> work<00:03:59.820> just<00:03:59.850> fine<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:01.010> on<00:04:02.010> this

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
but they will work just fine and on this

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.580 
but they will work just fine and on this
side<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.670> can<00:04:02.700> see<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.239> hoses<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
side here you can see the hoses with the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.430 
side here you can see the hoses with the
adjustability<00:04:05.459> on<00:04:05.790> them<00:04:06.050> yeah<00:04:07.050> there<00:04:07.200> we<00:04:07.260> go

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
adjustability on them yeah there we go

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.680 
adjustability on them yeah there we go
you<00:04:07.890> big<00:04:08.070> up<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.400> down<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.940> mean<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.480> don't

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
if I mention that already these hoses

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.070 
if I mention that already these hoses
are<00:04:14.580> very<00:04:15.060> stiff<00:04:16.190> it's<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.669> mean<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:18.510> it's

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
yeah they are pretty stiff so keep that

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.650

so just um so yeah next I will do some
noise<00:04:32.500> comparisons<00:04:33.070> show<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.670> three

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
noise comparisons show you the three

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.550 
noise comparisons show you the three
different<00:04:34.120> speed<00:04:34.360> sounds<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.080> let<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.410> know

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
so here are the fans at the low setting

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.000 
so here are the fans at the low setting
right<00:04:42.010> now<00:04:42.070> just<00:04:42.910> one<00:04:43.210> LED<00:04:43.780> part<00:04:44.530> is<00:04:44.680> lit<00:04:44.860> right

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
right now just one LED part is lit right

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.430 
right now just one LED part is lit right
there<00:04:45.600> put<00:04:46.600> a<00:04:46.630> little<00:04:46.660> piece<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.900> paper<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.320> the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
there put a little piece of paper on the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.480 
there put a little piece of paper on the
back<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:47.830> can<00:04:47.950> see<00:04:48.070> how<00:04:48.160> much<00:04:48.280> air<00:04:48.460> is

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
back so you can see how much air is

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.490 
back so you can see how much air is
being<00:04:48.760> blown<00:04:49.030> right<00:04:49.750> now<00:04:49.870> just<00:04:50.170> not<00:04:50.320> too<00:04:50.470> much

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
being blown right now just not too much

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.440 
being blown right now just not too much
you<00:04:51.070> know<00:04:51.190> be<00:04:51.610> quiet<00:04:51.850> so<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.060> guys<00:04:52.180> didn't

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
you know be quiet so you guys didn't

00:04:52.450 --> 00:05:05.210 
you know be quiet so you guys didn't
hear<00:04:52.660> how<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:52.870> is

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.010 

then<00:05:06.220> he's<00:05:06.400> in<00:05:06.430> seventh<00:05:07.150> pump<00:05:09.630> again<00:05:10.630> there's

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
then he's in seventh pump again there's

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.500 
then he's in seventh pump again there's
not<00:05:11.140> much<00:05:11.350> noise<00:05:11.560> at<00:05:11.830> all<00:05:12.100> on<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.210> low<00:05:13.330> setting

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
not much noise at all on the low setting

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.570 
not much noise at all on the low setting
can<00:05:14.050> you<00:05:14.140> might<00:05:14.530> have<00:05:14.620> been<00:05:15.160> able<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.400> hurt<00:05:15.550> a

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.149 

I<00:05:53.199> mean<00:05:54.199> the<00:05:54.379> pump<00:05:54.559> hasn't<00:05:54.739> gotten<00:05:54.979> any

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
I mean the pump hasn't gotten any

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.479 
I mean the pump hasn't gotten any
noisier<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.580> think<00:05:55.759> it<00:05:55.879> just<00:05:56.179> sits<00:05:56.360> at<00:05:56.449> one<00:05:56.569> rpm

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:57.489 
noisier I think it just sits at one rpm

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:00.429 
noisier I think it just sits at one rpm
but<00:05:58.489> yeah<00:05:58.729> it's<00:05:58.879> a<00:05:58.909> little<00:05:58.969> bit<00:05:59.119> louder<00:05:59.439> not

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:00.439 
but yeah it's a little bit louder not

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:01.540 
but yeah it's a little bit louder not
terrible<00:06:00.739> at<00:06:00.860> although<00:06:01.099> I'll<00:06:01.189> say<00:06:01.219> though

one thing I didn't notice is that when

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.129 
one thing I didn't notice is that when
you<00:06:04.369> press<00:06:04.489> the<00:06:04.669> button<00:06:04.939> it<00:06:05.029> ramps<00:06:05.569> up<00:06:05.629> to<00:06:06.050> the

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
you press the button it ramps up to the

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.689 
you press the button it ramps up to the
next<00:06:06.289> view<00:06:06.409> doesn't<00:06:06.739> instantly<00:06:07.009> kick<00:06:07.309> on<00:06:07.459> the

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
next view doesn't instantly kick on the

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.139 
next view doesn't instantly kick on the
next<00:06:07.939> rpm<00:06:08.269> and<00:06:08.449> slowly<00:06:08.749> ramps<00:06:09.199> up<00:06:09.319> to<00:06:09.529> it<00:06:09.649> so

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:10.149

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
the high performance setting as you see

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.290 
the high performance setting as you see
a<00:06:18.709> lot<00:06:19.189> more<00:06:19.219> air<00:06:19.550> is<00:06:19.669> being<00:06:19.849> pushed<00:06:20.179> through

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
a lot more air is being pushed through

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:38.879 
a lot more air is being pushed through
it<00:06:20.679> again<00:06:21.679> let<00:06:22.039> you<00:06:22.189> be<00:06:22.580> quiet

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
so yeah that's the song performance

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.260 
so yeah that's the song performance
again<00:06:42.530> I<00:06:42.560> forgot<00:06:42.800> to<00:06:42.979> mention<00:06:43.070> earlier<00:06:43.370> that

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
again I forgot to mention earlier that

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.450 
again I forgot to mention earlier that
each<00:06:44.690> of<00:06:44.720> these<00:06:44.960> are<00:06:45.229> at<00:06:45.350> the<00:06:45.560> lowest<00:06:45.889> rpm<00:06:46.160> of

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
each of these are at the lowest rpm of

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.080 
each of these are at the lowest rpm of
each<00:06:46.960> of<00:06:47.960> each<00:06:48.139> setting<00:06:48.590> they<00:06:49.400> ramp<00:06:49.699> up<00:06:49.820> quite

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
each of each setting they ramp up quite

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.480 
each of each setting they ramp up quite
a<00:06:50.120> bit<00:06:50.270> more<00:06:50.479> and<00:06:51.259> so<00:06:51.740> this<00:06:52.160> is<00:06:52.310> just<00:06:52.430> the

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
a bit more and so this is just the

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.070 
a bit more and so this is just the
lowest<00:06:52.789> setting<00:06:52.970> I'll<00:06:53.090> next<00:06:53.750> I'll<00:06:53.870> show<00:06:54.020> you

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
lowest setting I'll next I'll show you

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.080 
lowest setting I'll next I'll show you
guys<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.560> maximum<00:06:55.220> fan<00:06:55.490> speed<00:06:55.520> and<00:06:55.850> how<00:06:56.030> much

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
guys the maximum fan speed and how much

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.290 
guys the maximum fan speed and how much
noise<00:06:56.330> that<00:06:56.509> makes<00:06:57.789> alright<00:06:58.789> so<00:06:58.910> I<00:06:58.940> might<00:06:59.090> turn

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
noise that makes alright so I might turn

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.150 
noise that makes alright so I might turn
the<00:06:59.539> power<00:07:00.020> spline<00:07:00.289> and<00:07:00.470> this<00:07:00.680> will<00:07:00.830> let<00:07:00.979> you

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
the power spline and this will let you

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.800 
the power spline and this will let you
guys<00:07:01.280> hear<00:07:01.490> how<00:07:01.669> loud<00:07:01.850> the<00:07:02.120> fans<00:07:02.330> are<00:07:02.509> at<00:07:02.660> a

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
guys hear how loud the fans are at a

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.689 
guys hear how loud the fans are at a
pretty<00:07:03.350> sure<00:07:03.500> full<00:07:03.710> speed<00:07:03.979> so<00:07:04.280> here<00:07:04.580> we<00:07:04.669> go<00:07:06.699> so

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
pretty sure full speed so here we go so

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:08.950 
pretty sure full speed so here we go so
yeah<00:07:07.820> as<00:07:08.090> you<00:07:08.180> see<00:07:08.330> the<00:07:08.419> paper<00:07:08.600> is<00:07:08.750> almost

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
yeah as you see the paper is almost

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.629 
yeah as you see the paper is almost
completely<00:07:09.289> vertical<00:07:09.680> and<00:07:10.009> I'll<00:07:10.460> let<00:07:10.550> you

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
completely vertical and I'll let you

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:21.480 
completely vertical and I'll let you
guys<00:07:10.759> hear<00:07:10.940> foreign<00:07:11.389> ramps<00:07:11.720> down

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.969 

so<00:07:22.060> yeah<00:07:22.180> that's<00:07:22.389> the<00:07:22.600> fan<00:07:22.840> and<00:07:23.440> I<00:07:23.680> think

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
so yeah that's the fan and I think

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:30.270 
so yeah that's the fan and I think
maximum<00:07:24.580> speed<00:07:28.080> all<00:07:29.080> right<00:07:29.229> so<00:07:29.500> now<00:07:30.130> that's

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:30.280 
maximum speed all right so now that's

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.189 
maximum speed all right so now that's
off<00:07:30.460> I<00:07:30.669> will<00:07:30.940> put<00:07:31.210> it<00:07:31.300> in<00:07:31.389> my<00:07:31.569> computer<00:07:31.750> and

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
off I will put it in my computer and

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.870 
off I will put it in my computer and
I'll<00:07:32.380> let<00:07:32.650> you<00:07:32.800> guys<00:07:32.949> know<00:07:32.979> how<00:07:33.370> it<00:07:33.400> performs

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
I'll let you guys know how it performs

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.409 
I'll let you guys know how it performs
compared<00:07:34.690> to<00:07:34.840> the<00:07:34.960> stock<00:07:35.199> cooling<00:07:35.849> and<00:07:36.849> so<00:07:37.180> do

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:37.419 
compared to the stock cooling and so do

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:38.909 
compared to the stock cooling and so do
some<00:07:37.539> overclocking<00:07:37.720> and<00:07:38.020> see<00:07:38.229> how<00:07:38.500> well<00:07:38.830> it

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 
some overclocking and see how well it

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:41.190 
some overclocking and see how well it
works
