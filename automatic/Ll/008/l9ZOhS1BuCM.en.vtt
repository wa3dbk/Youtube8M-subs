00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.280
 then we will have our boat if you don't score that 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.549
 the first goal seemed to be taking 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.599
 you have to get a nice album it says that when I see how 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.790
 comes that the penalty area only for goalkeeper gold 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.280
 thereby again ensuring that a part in the eighteenth minute and of this 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280
 contest 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.170
 then there can simply be recorded shooting in addition there are already 2 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 7 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 On the right, the troops Michel launches is the only one 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.800
 dangerous player of this the dlc i must confess now it must be through them 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.870
 orientation data a second penalty 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.900
 and no, I actually think it is justified 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.310
 He comes on the right fine dollar and everything will be fine by that 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.390
 behind bars and so it is the second penalty for sharing this by the sea and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.120
 again it didn't look too dangerous but it seemed like a network to me 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.960
 position 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.750
 the state currently has all titles that are against its old club 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.950
 as in the first two penalties 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.830
 shortly afterwards two again have one for our country's society 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.070
 breasts falling behind in the competition where they are somewhat the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 have the upper hand 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.000
 As a result, there are mistakes in the back that they have had in recent years 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.370
 Monday is nothing to criticize we have two penalties were both 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.610
 utilized by the supply the stakeholders to a strong competition is on 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.570
 to deliver 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.120
 you hear the ball inside too 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.630
 it is then infringed on what you had started looking at nice weather max 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.620
 refuse it with a yellow card deposit so that maybe now you do 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.480
 a number of them go there and it's fun to do 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.210
 Red card 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 it's a red card that comes out that's a surprise picked the wrong one 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 card also he does indeed receive a red card 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.200
 He also missed the later, a data from that must be seen well 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.350
 For our part 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.520
 means that the drc and now again with in the fourth turn near the and first 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 half 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.640
 they have to go further with ten men it is the bleeckere that it has to be the field 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.369
 abandoned central defender 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.719
 so then will have what needs to be converted thereby became two years ago 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.879
 the higher house are just building barbara 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.930
 except for a gun but the referee doesn't have signs everywhere 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:32.829
 in balance 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.209
 behind and stands in the field and he is the referee after all 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.439
 safe and from one of the places he says he just keeps playing 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.569
 There is nevertheless on our police we were on a par with clear where the game 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 used to be 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:05.239
 the high word is out eve of the start of a striking vs no no me now 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.729
 is the word on depreciation 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:12.669
 before that he had a confessional statement to travel the scheme became 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.559
 Attended by analysts we expected 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.989
 Laura's were at home but it also played with the second team 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.989
 also made no claim to celebrate the victory 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.059
 if we missed it with a chance in the penalty area 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.009
 he may construct a hole of about twenty meters through it 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.300
 plays the engine you must things you must things hands past the opponent 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.520
 then you have to score what we want and it does better, but you still have to 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.440
 officially made up under 4 2 in injury time then we have one 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.820
 ultimately a goal by siem de jong who acts so many opportunities 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.080
 but now could not miss an absolute 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.039
 and so scored the 4 2 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.990
 for six nights the addresses are stored for two minutes against dsc 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.669
 a good answer 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.819
 yes people satisfied control of the competition 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.999
 and drove to make a goal 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.999
 a good thing to keep control and it was good with us 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.010
 hmm that we currently have a run away and the game then redan 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.989
 but it stays at 2 0 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.729
 then the exhibition becomes a goal and then we only have it for the dsc 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.259
 by two counts 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.259
 yes I have not seen them but enter two penalties 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.189
 the season is the basic accept and 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.479
 the center right trying to pick up the feed 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.139
 usually do not talk about leadership today it is hard to find the man 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.680
 we have to go with one 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.810
 because there it can put bark 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.469
 both with a little bit and that doesn't belong to the referee at all 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.139
 the red card was also a big surprise for me that partly certainty 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.180
 we keep 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.050
 not that red card in itself I thought we were the attack that made you 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.840
 committed 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.990
 but the nza in I have certainly seen twenty the twentieth field today what 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.840
 what is completely incomprehensible what decisions moment in, among other things 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.360
 the penalties mare 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.460
 the decisions that he made on his own 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.640
 on his own title say offside flagged and yes the man was completely the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.539
 lost 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.919
 that in the rest you exchange that you are up against ten men is his sleeve 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.699
 only realtors future emerged with the intention of putting more pressure forward 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.100
 put 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.639
 yes indeed look 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.020
 pressure to put it there and someday 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.280
 dragon at least a lot on the ball playing tommy on behalf is of course the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.020
 boy here 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.389
 often comes running for the ball that has growth ideas 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.610
 yes the busy one that was there also have the whole second half already a lot 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.659
 be able to play the ball and therefore an offside goal for the band because well 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.439
 outside of play is that he therefore also approves on his own title yes become complete 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.120
 from the game played by the referee yes because there were queues here 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.259
 on the contador i see you in line with that case he so i can alone 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.279
 but saying that they are wrong he sidelined my forests manager 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.670
 so it does not fall so there would be three one 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.119
 so what can you do with such a team 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:58.619
 yeah actually those teams are dam and steeringless the only thing you can do is 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:01.769
 hope you still have a goal but watch the quality we have on it 

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:03.279
 had the chances for that 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.879
 only years almost everything we try there is nevertheless with if it is 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.639
 colossus is called 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.020
 or for offside or that it just did not last year you know the boiling point at 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.169
 walk so high that they can no longer function normally and 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.180
 even on the side it was just that the group was a rudder and then it is 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.229
 hope for one 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.620
 a ball that falls well but yes that we would lose that was actually already 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.189
 clear after twenty minutes 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:30.319
 hi siren 4 2 but by all bale I don't care anymore 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.569
 fortunately it was not too long to continue playing the game was long ago 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:33.900
 more 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.330
 no the only thing 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.650
 what is dangerous in all cards in lobith the cards that shares in ds 7 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.189
 has 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:44.060
 and also for both of us having come to this phase that will be next set 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.610
 yes look that in a lesser match he whistles that we can be there but that 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.340
 is now also at the expense of players 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.330
 both with the opponent and with us 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.520
 yes because in addition to the rosehip knife for a natural by this you lose mail 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.580
 another reasonable cell certainly ends up the promotion but maybe even it 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.719
 championship 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:04.270
 we also have radio team on the road again for next week against rkc 2 but very 

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:06.889
 I have a hard time knowing everyone what it is today 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.940
 and we actually have we were naturally angry in the clay tca 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:13.740
 but we also had to laugh at our own because well again we have met 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.620
 are all able to see that this man was horrible and here can be your idea 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.279
 to play soccer and earth is not on the team I can tell you must 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:24.569
 remain calm you have to make it play football solve this was quite 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:29.139
 extreme lowering you have to be so strong mentally that you have nothing to do with it 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.339
 does it is beside but the impossible
