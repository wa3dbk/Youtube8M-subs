drive off you just there's four screws
here<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.330> two<00:01:06.720> three<00:01:07.229> four<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
here one two three four just basically a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.340 
here one two three four just basically a
bracket<00:01:10.100> holding<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> hard<00:01:11.369> drive<00:01:11.549> down<00:01:12.350> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
bracket holding the hard drive down and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
bracket holding the hard drive down and
I'll<00:01:13.439> explain<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.780> take

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
I'll explain what they do so just take

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
I'll explain what they do so just take
those<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.439> often<00:01:19.619> i'm<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> pull

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
those too often i'm just kind of pull

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
those too often i'm just kind of pull
that<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> longer

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that up and then you got to longer

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.410 
that up and then you got to longer
screws<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:27.740> use<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.920> nail<00:01:29.070> pull<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> up<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.499 

then<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.200> careful<00:01:34.619> thing<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
then the careful thing about this is

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
then the careful thing about this is
don't<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.720> yank<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
don't just yank it up it's not like a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.450 
don't just yank it up it's not like a
regular<00:01:37.890> sada<00:01:38.390> sada<00:01:39.390> connection<00:01:39.960> where<00:01:40.200> it's

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
regular sada sada connection where it's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.530 
regular sada sada connection where it's
going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> stick<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.210> actually

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
going to stick right there it's actually

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.050 
going to stick right there it's actually
attached<00:01:42.950> with<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> cable<00:01:45.079> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> look

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
attached with a cable if you can look

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.800 
attached with a cable if you can look
she<00:01:48.810> has<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.140> cable<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.780> just

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
she has a cable there so you would just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.039 
she has a cable there so you would just
disconnect<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.420> there<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.780> slide

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
disconnect it from there and then slide

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.230 
disconnect it from there and then slide
your<00:01:55.079> new<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:56.909> insert

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
your new one on and then they insert

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
your new one on and then they insert
these<00:01:57.390> little<00:01:57.659> pins<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> sides<00:01:58.409> where<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
these little pins on the sides where the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.279 
these little pins on the sides where the
screw<00:01:58.920> holes<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.930> holds<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
screw holes would be so it holds it

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.450 
screw holes would be so it holds it
actually<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.329> bracket<00:02:03.329> there

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
actually in this little bracket there

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.380 
actually in this little bracket there
stick<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.490> back<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:05.970> I<00:02:08.119> mean<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.179> literally

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
stick that back on I mean it literally

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.460 
stick that back on I mean it literally
