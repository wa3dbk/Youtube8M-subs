00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.850
 7 also supported baseball 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.239
 No 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.939
 The problems that came out today were lined up 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.899
 help me 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.899
 I will consult with you for the remaining two years 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.039
 7243 households will be able to move in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.039
 As a result of collecting their own words 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.310
 I agree 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 Fall from high school 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.410
 I'm here because I'm not motivated 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.410
 Search from the words you said 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.680
 I want to get last season 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.110
 Now here 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.110
 A new affirmation was born 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.510
 Gunma 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.380
 We supply 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.220
 Then 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 Lose, throw and throw 2 2 balls after death 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.700
 I also have problems 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 I should do it in high school 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 It does not conform to the same school name custom 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.230
 life 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.460
 Content that says things by preconception 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.730
 As you see, the cleaning is perfect 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.710
 Not even 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.020
 Now here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 A new affirmation was born 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.440
 Gunma 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.140
 that is 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810
 Stupid 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.340
 I will go 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.160
 Double as one 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.710
 What's 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.680
 Change the policy in the continuation of dreams 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.619
 A man who did not have a Suzutan figure 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.569
 In prefecture 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.359
 I ran away 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.509
 I hope you will receive 13 days 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.809
 That's the attitude I was full on the same day 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.079
 Even as a Democratic Party 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.759
 I tell you that you have as many hands as possible 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.789
 is that different 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.669
 I mainly go to 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.409
 In other words 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.329
 It means that you were panic and panic 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.889
 To the screening meeting 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.689
 7. 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.179
 Here again 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.179
 New Ming prefecture was born 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.639
 Gunma 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.939
 Fukushima 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.069
 This is me 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.260
 I also do not understand such a translation 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 If it will be left to Yasuo 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.549
 I did not take too hard to get on with my tone 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 wimax 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.640
 It has been stagnant and has been an issue 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.859
 It was sunny a little bit 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.909
 Community support is also a regional seminar 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.909
 From the committee Mr. Italian saying fast 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.229
 It is a form without a reporter 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.129
 When it comes to this, enter the affirmation in town 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.439
 Men mention that she does not want to go for a moment 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.439
 It's already a quote 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.559
 Outstanding 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.189
 Thank you 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.659
 As a result 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 I got it too 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.369
 army 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 Konoha Chairperson has still been 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.499
 Don't do anything that was outrageous to this uproar 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.499
 I wonder if I was heading 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.029
 Such inside 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.029
 I'm already 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.319
 listener 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.529
 There are also many multi-name multi 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.719
 army 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.159
 Teacher opens 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.159
 Physical strength and energy 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.849
 army 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.129
 And long-term operation 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:23.300
 this guy 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.300
 I'm teaching for the total number 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.479
 Possible for a long time 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.429
 I was stabbed aside
