hook all the wires up now you can see
the<00:01:29.250> wires<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.969> clip<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.420> squeeze<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
radio comes with the same type of clip

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.050 
radio comes with the same type of clip
of<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> wires

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
of all the wires

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.050 
of all the wires
you<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> match<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.759> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you just have to match them up and just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
you just have to match them up and just
be<00:01:39.210> happy<00:01:39.539> that<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.810> Box<00:01:40.020> has<00:01:40.289> all<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.770> wires

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
be happy that the Box has all the wires

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.969 
be happy that the Box has all the wires
and<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:42.000> they<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.590> case<00:01:43.799> we're

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and where they go and in this case we're

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
and where they go and in this case we're
extremely<00:01:44.280> lucky<00:01:44.490> because<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.719> connector

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
extremely lucky because the connector

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
extremely lucky because the connector
for<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> new<00:01:46.469> radio<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.430> same<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.789> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
for the new radio is the same as the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.090 
for the new radio is the same as the
connector<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> old<00:01:48.659> radio<00:01:48.930> snaps<00:01:49.799> right

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
connector from the old radio snaps right

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.580 
connector from the old radio snaps right
in<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.359> this<00:01:51.479> case<00:01:51.719> we<00:01:52.140> won't<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
in so in this case we won't have to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.639 
in so in this case we won't have to
rewire<00:01:52.950> anything<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.049> you're<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.380> lucky

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
rewire anything but if you're not lucky

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
rewire anything but if you're not lucky
they<00:01:55.799> come<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.280> directions<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:57.420> red<00:01:57.630> wire

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
they come with directions the red wire

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
they come with directions the red wire
is<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> ignition<00:01:58.590> when<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.039> turn<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> key<00:01:59.520> on

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
is the ignition when you turn the key on

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
is the ignition when you turn the key on

the time to keep memory in the radio
it's<00:02:07.920> not<00:02:08.130> that<00:02:08.340> complicated<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.240> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's not that complicated but in the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's not that complicated but in the
case<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.720> car<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.320> has<00:02:10.590> four

case of a car like this that has four
speakers<00:02:11.190> there's<00:02:11.880> not<00:02:12.060> an<00:02:12.120> eight<00:02:12.360> speaker

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
speakers there's not an eight speaker

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.770 
speakers there's not an eight speaker
wire<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.590> takes<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.890> little<00:02:14.010> bit<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.250> time

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
wire so it takes a little bit of time

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.820 
wire so it takes a little bit of time
then<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.110> bracket<00:02:16.470> from<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> old

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you just screw them in tight huh then

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.800 
you just screw them in tight huh then
you<00:02:29.489> get<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> antenna<00:02:30.120> wire<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.569> plug<00:02:30.780> that
