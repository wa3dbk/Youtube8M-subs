00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.170
 there is the first chance and there is almost 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.559
 death but it is the salvation of the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.120
 toe man from moldavia radon michu 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.860
 20-year-old keeper must have scapa series of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.790
 a goal keeping good opening right away 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.790
 to a minute and a half 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 who can can opinion 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.040
 so the man's black ball is off again 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.510
 possession 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.750
 you love your BMW with a bird and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.230
 michu's ring but it's all hands on 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.130
 deck at moldova 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.320
 the belgium start well with already the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.600
 the possibility you can do for joris 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.610
 him a good action well away the earthly 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 two bands remove it immediately 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.920
 if the first goal can fall then she will 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 may have left 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 but nobody wants him 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.070
 always been a whole in any case 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 defensive opponent 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.590
 expect them to think only earned 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.520
 Paul could have benefited from dust master 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.090
 quickly the fleets and the ball 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.689
 interesting place anyway 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.689
 for a free kick 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.440
 with the i-th man 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.320
 healing is along 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.550
 big boys then that ball comes towards 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.640
 the two white balls man 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.030
 michu barrels under the ball and hits 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.740
 the ball 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.110
 actual purpose and state 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 symbol for field you the early 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.250
 opening goal she wanted so badly 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:18.270
 is a fact youri tielemans has it 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 done a 0 interesting for belgium 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.340
 place as said just a little too far 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.940
 actually but walking is going to be one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.940
 just below 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.670
 27th minute three thielemans 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.820
 the ball goes into the boxing school you come and 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.950
 there is the header and screened for now 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.470
 seven hours from not so on the paul van 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.820
 julienne de saar this was almost the two 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.550
 zero again and I set the stage and 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.360
 feet again cut the saar bowl 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.310
 walked in at the right time 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.850
 two upcoming red devils that just 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.810
 no offside and the umpteenth 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.480
 corner kick 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.190
 the time on the right with 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.860
 thieleman's head towards the second post 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.210
 whole not maybe i can go opinion 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.540
 now with the layers of fabric it's no mike's 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.060
 report 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.819
 the end of 10 chestnut is the maker of it 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.640
 second goal for the Belgians just before 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.859
 the break was the ideal moment for one 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.260
 the second goal 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.159
 timati chestnut 2 0 for which ball 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.129
 again very high come here we see that we 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.959
 just as bad 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.480
 then so are the just not 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.299
 can initially but then behind 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.299
 him chestnut no offside 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.819
 violation a card 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.299
 well that was a brake on Beijing 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.879
 and yellow for whole now the most dangerous 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.099
 man and are curious if you are one too 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.989
 can take a free kick because this is real 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.669
 a good place where does that spit 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.759
 century with theo yes I want anyway 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.009
 fantastic within a free kick on one 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.270
 good place we said and then showered idea 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.400
 how this 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.440
 test the world perhaps and yet 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.270
 survive achievement but a 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.440
 beautiful goal frankie that we two 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.870
 a 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.690
 he or she will be back if they are the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.699
 moment the most talent that shows that 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.860
 here ff 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.099
 the ball is still reasonable 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.659
 far enough that perfect the top 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.659
 not to catch up for weird 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.200
 on March 5 you won out of ten in the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.320
 previous campaign another top is true there 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.990
 is the chance for the read of 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.780
 Thomas Foket this was the opportunity to 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.120
 the three one for Belgium but one 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.990
 fantastic action from had to be Sunday 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.090
 those days walking through the defense and 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.050
 then before it played on but that let 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.910
 opportunities lie 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.740
 toe man was also there I thought 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.260
 but I don't change what we look at 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.420
 it certainly made a good dribble of it 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.980
 had to investigate just no offside 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.510
 because kramer 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.520
 on the other hand still stop but this was 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.520
 so a good rescue from witse 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.289
 without now how to give Sunday on the left 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.460
 may there is may yes khawaja one of them 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.650
 mitchell 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.389
 the white ones don't live where the ball is but 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.400
 has a hell yes but is the new one 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.400
 where we got the ball 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.889
 the promise and proximus always close
