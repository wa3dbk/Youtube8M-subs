sport<00:04:08.400> mode<00:04:08.790> which<00:04:08.999> is<00:04:09.510> my<00:04:09.689> favorite<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.290> this

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
sport mode which is my favorite and this

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.280 
sport mode which is my favorite and this
is<00:04:11.159> actually<00:04:11.489> pretty<00:04:11.639> cool<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.870> shut<00:04:13.139> off

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
is actually pretty cool if you shut off

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.050 
is actually pretty cool if you shut off
the<00:04:13.469> car<00:04:13.650> completely<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.459> then<00:04:14.639> turn<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:14.939> back

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
the car completely and then turn it back

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.870 
the car completely and then turn it back
on<00:04:15.209> again<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.930> car<00:04:16.259> will<00:04:16.440> actually<00:04:16.590> stay<00:04:17.579> in

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
on again the car will actually stay in

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.689 
on again the car will actually stay in
sport<00:04:18.479> mode<00:04:18.709> typically<00:04:19.709> car<00:04:19.979> makers<00:04:20.280> don't<00:04:20.489> do

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
sport mode typically car makers don't do

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.550 
sport mode typically car makers don't do
that<00:04:20.880> because<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.359> affects<00:04:21.630> their<00:04:21.780> epa<00:04:22.079> score

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
that because it affects their epa score

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.950 
that because it affects their epa score
if<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:23.310> will<00:04:23.729> stick<00:04:24.090> into<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.360> certain<00:04:24.720> mode

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
if it will stick into a certain mode

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.779 
if it will stick into a certain mode
then<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.199> epa<00:04:25.530> will<00:04:25.770> score<00:04:26.250> them<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.580> the

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
then the epa will score them on the

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.939 
then the epa will score them on the
worst<00:04:27.060> condition<00:04:27.720> mode<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.650> if<00:04:28.830> you're

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
worst condition mode so if you're

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.589 
worst condition mode so if you're

everything<00:06:36.310> from<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.849> wood<00:06:37.120> trim<00:06:37.389> over<00:06:37.509> there

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
everything from the wood trim over there

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.219 
everything from the wood trim over there
to<00:06:38.560> the<00:06:39.370> soft<00:06:40.090> touch<00:06:40.330> plastics<00:06:41.789> to<00:06:42.960> the<00:06:43.960> Q

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
to the soft touch plastics to the Q

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:45.749 
to the soft touch plastics to the Q
system<00:06:44.650> which<00:06:44.919> feels<00:06:45.190> like<00:06:45.370> it's<00:06:45.580> something

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 
system which feels like it's something

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.839 
system which feels like it's something
directly<00:06:46.330> out<00:06:46.659> of<00:06:46.690> the<00:06:46.870> future<00:06:47.289> so<00:06:48.009> if<00:06:48.340> you

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
directly out of the future so if you

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.730 
directly out of the future so if you
were<00:06:48.969> to<00:06:49.090> compare<00:06:49.270> this<00:06:49.870> car<00:06:50.199> to<00:06:50.650> the

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
were to compare this car to the

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.619 
were to compare this car to the

I<00:06:52.659> think<00:06:53.229> the<00:06:53.650> ATS<00:06:54.219> wouldn't<00:06:54.699> stand<00:06:55.150> up

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
I think the ATS wouldn't stand up

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.170 
I think the ATS wouldn't stand up
extremely<00:06:56.500> well<00:06:56.770> and<00:06:57.250> it<00:06:57.789> has<00:06:57.969> the<00:06:58.150> added

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180
