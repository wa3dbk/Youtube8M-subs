today<00:00:12.509> I'm<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.110> talking<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
today I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.970 
today I'm going to be talking about the
design<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.309> my<00:00:14.460> passive<00:00:14.969> solar<00:00:15.179> tiny<00:00:15.630> house

most people in the u.s. heat their homes

most people in the u.s. heat their homes
with<00:00:18.690> fossil<00:00:19.109> fuel<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.529> some<00:00:19.710> kind

and<00:00:20.250> although<00:00:20.699> houses<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.300> become<00:00:21.600> much

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
and although houses have become much

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.810 
and although houses have become much
more<00:00:21.960> efficient<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.590> recent<00:00:22.949> decades<00:00:23.070> they've

more efficient in recent decades they've

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.820 
more efficient in recent decades they've
also<00:00:24.029> gotten<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:24.750> bigger<00:00:25.050> which<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.650> offset

many<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> gains<00:00:26.789> made<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.990> odd<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.230> we

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
many of the gains made it's odd that we

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
many of the gains made it's odd that we
waste<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.039> much<00:00:29.070> fuel<00:00:29.490> heating<00:00:29.970> our<00:00:30.090> houses

local<00:01:44.720> firewood<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.440> have<00:01:46.070> rarely<00:01:46.310> had<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.850> do

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
local firewood I have rarely had to do

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.820 
local firewood I have rarely had to do
this<00:01:47.150> though<00:01:47.480> because<00:01:47.780> my<00:01:48.080> house<00:01:48.260> burns<00:01:48.590> so

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
this though because my house burns so

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.470 
this though because my house burns so
little<00:01:49.130> wood<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.580> because<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.180> can<00:01:50.330> usually

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
little wood and because I can usually

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.050 
little wood and because I can usually
find<00:01:50.900> enough<00:01:51.230> waste<00:01:51.470> wood<00:01:51.970> eventually<00:01:52.970> it

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
find enough waste wood eventually it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.090 
find enough waste wood eventually it
would<00:01:53.150> be<00:01:53.300> great<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.570> have<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:53.900> woodlot<00:01:54.290> here<00:01:54.680> so

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
would be great to have a woodlot here so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.740 
would be great to have a woodlot here so
that<00:01:55.280> we<00:01:55.370> can<00:01:55.550> grow<00:01:55.700> our<00:01:55.760> own<00:01:55.910> firewood<00:01:56.570> to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
that we can grow our own firewood to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.880 
that we can grow our own firewood to
supply<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.110> village

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.980 

so<00:02:03.400> you<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.670> see<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> south<00:02:04.420> side<00:02:04.690> of<00:02:04.750> my

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
so you can see that the south side of my

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.100 
so you can see that the south side of my
house<00:02:05.200> has<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> lot<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.920> window<00:02:06.760> space<00:02:07.120> today<00:02:07.930> is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
house has a lot of window space today is

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.570 
house has a lot of window space today is
a<00:02:08.290> sunny<00:02:08.560> day<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:08.860> there's<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.369> lot<00:02:09.550> of

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
a sunny day and there's a lot of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.730 
a sunny day and there's a lot of
sunlight<00:02:09.940> going<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.540> it's<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:11.410> middle<00:02:11.650> of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
sunlight going in it's the middle of

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.070 
sunlight going in it's the middle of
winter<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.000> there's<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.300> lot<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.630> passive

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
winter and so there's a lot of passive

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.220 
winter and so there's a lot of passive
solar<00:02:14.140> heat<00:02:14.880> gain<00:02:15.880> inside<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.960> day<00:02:17.200> like

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
solar heat gain inside on a day like

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.340 
solar heat gain inside on a day like
today<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:18.270> designed<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.360> house<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.780> insulated

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
today I designed the house and insulated

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.210 
today I designed the house and insulated
it<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.900> maximize<00:02:23.500> its<00:02:23.890> heat

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
it so that it can maximize its heat

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.540 
it so that it can maximize its heat
retention<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.780> three<00:02:26.140> sides<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.950> get<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
retention the three sides that get the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.350 
retention the three sides that get the
least<00:02:27.760> sun<00:02:28.060> exposure<00:02:28.900> are<00:02:30.330> insulated<00:02:31.330> with

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360

can<00:05:52.210> just<00:05:52.389> come<00:05:53.320> in<00:05:53.530> in<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:54.099> evening<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.699> just

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
can just come in in the evening and just

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:00.089 
can just come in in the evening and just
drop<00:05:55.210> all<00:05:55.509> of<00:05:55.570> them<00:05:55.900> and<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:57.870> then<00:05:58.979> in<00:05:59.979> the

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
drop all of them and and then in the

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.689 
drop all of them and and then in the
morning<00:06:01.500> draw<00:06:02.500> them<00:06:02.680> back<00:06:02.770> up<00:06:02.979> if<00:06:03.250> it's<00:06:03.610> a

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
morning draw them back up if it's a

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.399 
morning draw them back up if it's a
sunny<00:06:03.909> day<00:06:04.000> if<00:06:04.330> it's<00:06:04.509> not<00:06:04.659> a<00:06:04.690> sunny<00:06:05.020> day<00:06:05.229> I'll

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
sunny day if it's not a sunny day I'll

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.100 
sunny day if it's not a sunny day I'll
keep<00:06:05.620> most<00:06:05.979> of<00:06:06.190> them<00:06:06.370> down<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:07.419> keep<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:07.870> cold

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
keep most of them down to keep the cold

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.600 
keep most of them down to keep the cold
out<00:06:08.490> and<00:06:09.490> then<00:06:10.020> have<00:06:11.020> maybe<00:06:11.560> just<00:06:11.650> them

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
out and then have maybe just them

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.339 
out and then have maybe just them
slightly<00:06:13.120> open<00:06:13.449> so<00:06:13.599> I<00:06:13.630> can<00:06:13.719> get<00:06:13.990> some<00:06:14.199> of<00:06:14.289> the

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
slightly open so I can get some of the

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.170 
slightly open so I can get some of the
natural<00:06:14.800> light<00:06:15.009> in<00:06:15.219> here<00:06:15.490> so<00:06:15.849> when<00:06:16.030> they're

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
natural light in here so when they're

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.149 
natural light in here so when they're
open<00:06:16.330> because<00:06:17.169> I've<00:06:17.349> got<00:06:17.500> all<00:06:17.650> these<00:06:17.830> windows

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
open because I've got all these windows

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.370 
open because I've got all these windows
on<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:18.490> south<00:06:18.699> side<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.630> sunlight<00:06:20.020> pouring

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
on the south side the sunlight pouring

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.800 
on the south side the sunlight pouring
in<00:06:20.710> it's<00:06:21.310> falling<00:06:21.759> on<00:06:21.880> the<00:06:21.940> earthen<00:06:22.539> floor

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
in it's falling on the earthen floor

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.430 
in it's falling on the earthen floor
which<00:06:23.620> has<00:06:23.860> a<00:06:23.889> large<00:06:24.659> amount<00:06:25.659> of<00:06:25.779> thermal<00:06:26.199> mass

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
which has a large amount of thermal mass

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.290 
which has a large amount of thermal mass
so<00:06:27.240> throughout<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.449> day

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
so throughout the day

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.420 
so throughout the day
the<00:06:29.539> floor<00:06:29.840> is<00:06:30.110> collecting<00:06:30.860> that<00:06:31.009> sun's

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
the floor is collecting that sun's

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.420 
the floor is collecting that sun's
energy<00:06:31.699> and<00:06:32.000> then<00:06:32.930> when<00:06:33.229> I<00:06:33.259> put<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.190> shades

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
energy and then when I put the shades

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.890 
energy and then when I put the shades
down<00:06:34.639> at<00:06:34.849> the<00:06:34.940> end<00:06:35.090> of<00:06:35.240> the<00:06:35.300> day<00:06:35.449> after<00:06:35.660> the

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
down at the end of the day after the

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.050 
down at the end of the day after the
sun's<00:06:36.139> gone<00:06:36.349> down<00:06:36.410> the<00:06:37.280> floor<00:06:37.550> will<00:06:37.789> then

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
sun's gone down the floor will then

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.450 
sun's gone down the floor will then
radiate<00:06:38.750> that<00:06:38.960> heat<00:06:39.020> back<00:06:39.500> into<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:40.160> space

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
radiate that heat back into the space

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.730 
radiate that heat back into the space
now<00:06:41.180> my<00:06:41.300> house<00:06:41.449> has<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.720> lot<00:06:41.840> of<00:06:41.990> windows<00:06:42.440> on<00:06:42.620> the

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
now my house has a lot of windows on the

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.680 
now my house has a lot of windows on the
south<00:06:42.889> side<00:06:43.220> for<00:06:43.250> passive<00:06:43.910> solar<00:06:44.090> heating

south side for passive solar heating

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.659 
south side for passive solar heating
but<00:06:45.020> I've<00:06:45.139> also<00:06:45.319> put<00:06:45.650> one<00:06:45.680> small<00:06:46.160> window<00:06:46.520> on

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
but I've also put one small window on

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.730 
but I've also put one small window on
