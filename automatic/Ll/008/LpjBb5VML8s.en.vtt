 little bit we'll say a little word too 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.640
 with your coach since a 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.840
 performance than that achieved by 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.789

 how was this 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.120

 level of performance needs for 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.840
 the selection learned since 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.550

 the Youth Olympic Games to which 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.180

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.540
 to be a little bit dependent on all that 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.710
