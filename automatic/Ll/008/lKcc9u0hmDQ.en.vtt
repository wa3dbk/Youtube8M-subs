00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.260
 the bakery is for a discovery 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.280
 for these adults in reconversion 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.230
 professional 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.470
 it's a whole new career 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.170
 who is profiled worked a fortnight 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.449
 of years in a transport company 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.230
 overhead and I decided to live my 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.090
 passion 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 so this year I suffered the sap and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 bakery ferrandi that your pato there 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.439
 is shorter than your roll you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 go first gave him your width 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.270
 and then you can give him back the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 length the 60 at the base of a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 sound engineer training when I 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 worked four years before I was sitting 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 arming console all day 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.489
 locked in a studio and loose in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.289
 contact with other people 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.570
 I touch something alive at the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 dough and I find it really nice 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.309
 so that stretch well she is flexible and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 Nickel I really started from scratch 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.520
 knew nothing about the bakery going 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 start the patchac with water must 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.359
 to launch euro made debate is twisted 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 it's impressive when you arrive 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.140
 it's impressive it's not right 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.020
 happen because tonins have everything is 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 complicated at the beginning and after three 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.360
 weeks we get to feel comfortable here 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.100
 progress in four months, and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.439
 dazzling because in fact we have 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.759
 a lot of practical work wanted 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.320
 let relax and immediately you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.630
 look for mussels the time you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.530
 prepare your mussels sarah relaxation and 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.439
 you to chain touch others 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 shaping behind you thank you 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.130
 which I like a lot also during 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 your logerie is that I think that already 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.909
 the teacher is very available he is 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.280
 nice he was crying explained several 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.470
 time he really takes his time I 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 find a lot of human love 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.009
 transmission of his know-how 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.320
 So that's what I found 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.939
 here they are really important go for it 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:56.729
 and would go look for a little more 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:00.780
 Gazans agree to the villa is here to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.579
 lift it up and I think I have 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.469
 been well trained then the end of the internship 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.170
 injured me the afternoon alone in 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.849
 the emptying of the story waters that I have 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.129
 almost at the level of hunger I would let go 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.599
 to go to work 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.940
 to leave a company you have a 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.010
 very good place to follow his passion 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 it's true that it's quite daring that's 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
 risky so the internship can confirm 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.690
 really this idea this project 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.120
 professional 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.360
 it did not discourage me 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.470
 more and more in love with this job 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.090
 that one is not already easy to make 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.280
 experience is not leaving everything from 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.870
 following the blindness of really 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.090
 to master my subject this is at the level 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.130
 technical than at the level know how to handle a 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.630
 shop from there I think it 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.030
 ready to open my own business 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.200
 even though the diploma broke ap but 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.780
 my dream is to be able to go 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.910
 Africa and make a music school 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.040
 medium term after having acquired 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.180
 enough experience 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.910
 professional I would like to open 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.180
 a bakery pastry rather in 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.000
 the bio I did well to follow my 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.480
 instinct to follow my passion yes I 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.260
