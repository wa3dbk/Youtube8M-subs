00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.770
 Hey people, welcome to another one. 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.349
 video directories and has already made a 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.740
 little different because today I teach the 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.080
 How do you play the pokémon tcg? 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.539
 exactly because it shows a freighter 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.910
 have easier to find people today 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.970
 who know Pokémon than those who do not 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.150
 knows why pokémon is a lot series 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.730
 famous successful franchise for sure and 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.659
 also a card game is also very 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.570
 famous if I am not mistaken prefect in 96 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.659
 In other words, a very old game warehouse until 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.600
 today many people play without 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.250
 and there are also world championships 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.769
 that own nintendo makes the power 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.400
 promoting a training match will wrap 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.839
 we will very soon learn this play will 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.299
 be a little lost because 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.580
 there are many rules of the game of course 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.460
 not too complicated but it is not 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.080
 as simple as multi should think then 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.150
 come on 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.190
 first of all we have to know how to 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.450
 do to win the game can defeat 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.580
 your opponent 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.820
 he knows what one of these three 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.640
 first cases or cd rock all 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.030
 Pokémon in your opponent's field 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.160
 I ask you to defeat the whole six 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.250
 pokémon of the opponent 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.990
 and third, that your opponent finishes 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.960
 and in the round that he can not afford 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.610
 no letter he loses then is that 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.159
 be able to win one of these three 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.030
 things seem simple but not so much 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.040
 like this 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.310
 now let's know the structure of the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.770
 Pokemon field was kagame jumping 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 from right to left on the right side 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.900
 is formed by two areas, the upper one is 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.610
 where you put the deck that is to 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.540
 who does not know is a deck for who ever 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 played a tcg game are your letters that 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.740
 you pull during the game the cards 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.229
 that you would use the dj with 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.470
 treatment and at the bottom where it is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.209
 to locate the exhaust stack ie 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.459
 where to put their states as 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.049
 pokémons motorcycles class of 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.799
 coaches used and thus 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.600
 against 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.280
 all the houses that were used and 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.770
 nothing will go out to the trail of 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 dial but for lack of usual 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.010
 players 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.260
 many of them and see that one place of each 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.510
 one that sometimes puts the deck in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.909
 low discarding over but the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.519
 inversion of these places does not affect 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.280
 nothing in the game because there is no problem 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.069
 do this in a certain field in the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.069
 where the active pokémon will be 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.319
 be the pokémon that will defend and attack 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.530
 only one 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.019
 pokémon below where the bank is also 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.849
 known as black bent and will place 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.920
 only pokémons reserves that 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.950
 replaced the active pokémon if he 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.500
 die back hand back to the deck skirt 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.690
 game or go back to the bank 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.489
 in all was to put at most five 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.650
 because mons in the bank that can 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.540
 future to become an active pokémon and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.910
 on the left you put the boxes 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.459
 that is, the houses that will be 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.950
 acquired for each pokémon that you 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.440
 to defeat the local judge's auto stand 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.319

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.349
