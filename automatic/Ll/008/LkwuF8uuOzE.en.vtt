00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.950

 Mexico because it was a country where I had 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.529

 be able to be here not only for the fan but 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.220
 also for visiting this wonderful 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.220
 country 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.679
 interesting that he does not know much about you 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 let me tell you that you have 16 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.390
 years and practically composes all the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.950
 songs from your album already casting a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.559
 snout today is where he gets his 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.890
 inspiration at such a young age 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 was in the composition is good has me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 always called a lot of attention and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289
 this album we went to the angels to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.210
 compose it and we were surrounded by people 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.460
 very important chris producers 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.399
 brown rihanna shakira 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 even my idol bruno mars and it was a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 incredible experience and I usually 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 inspire for example on friends in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.290
 family or in some history that that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.630
 has happened previously and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 just sit at the piano and they flow 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.369
 the ideas I see that you sing in the church 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 in Spanish yes yes I love to merge the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.850
 two languages ​​because I think English I 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 contributes one thing that I do not give to Spanish 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.040
 and vice versa no longer you realize 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.509
 that his was music then you're 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.060
 very young but for what I have 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.369
 understood from a very young age and already 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.860
 seven years I won a prize there in 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.979
 Spain of music and that's when I gave myself 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 truly account of what I 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.549
 I liked to do then I was going through 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.430
 various television programs I made a 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.460
 disc with 10 years and then another with 14 yes 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 and the second with 14 and the latter with 16 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.810
 you were inspired by someone you look at 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 someone I love michael jackson and I 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.310
 love also bruno mars 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.600
 They are my biggest idols also that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.640
 you have opened you are going to open concerts 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.310
 Waters of the exxon is sad now between 9 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.189
 with carlos vera it was something something 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.159
 awesome share stage with 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.770
 Carlos ribera because she is an artist who 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.390
 I have admired a lot since always and 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.560
 an honor to have shared the stage with 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.920
 one of the best voices I've ever 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.509
 never heard and the same 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.840
 of 9 are already like my little brothers 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.030
 Mexicans we connect very well and I think that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.099
 that's the most important thing not every 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.080
 connection at last to the end and after 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.560
 of being great artists are very big 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.560
