00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.509 

in<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.170> video<00:00:07.379> what<00:00:07.950> we're<00:00:08.069> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
in this video what we're going to do is

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.860 
in this video what we're going to do is
have<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> look<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.059> how<00:00:09.150> an<00:00:09.269> electric<00:00:09.690> show

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
have a look at how an electric show

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.070 
have a look at how an electric show
works<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:11.010> what<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.210> do<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> will<00:00:12.929> identify

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
works so what I do is I will identify

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.230 
works so what I do is I will identify
the<00:00:13.559> main<00:00:13.860> components<00:00:14.490> I'll<00:00:14.639> briefly<00:00:15.120> mention

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the main components I'll briefly mention

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
the main components I'll briefly mention
the<00:00:15.599> most<00:00:16.020> common<00:00:16.379> faults<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.859> these

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the most common faults with these

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.710 
the most common faults with these
components<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.449> give<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
components and just give you a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.080 
components and just give you a
run-through<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.320> what<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> parts<00:00:20.850> do

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
run-through of what all the parts do

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.240 
run-through of what all the parts do
before<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.170> do<00:00:22.320> any<00:00:22.500> work<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.039> shower

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
before you do any work in a shower

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.800 
before you do any work in a shower
before<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.730> take<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> cover<00:00:24.210> off<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.630> show

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
before you take the cover off the show

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529 
before you take the cover off the show
you<00:00:25.289> must<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.680> sure<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.099> shows<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
you must make sure the shows see so that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
you must make sure the shows see so that
means<00:00:27.779> making<00:00:28.050> sure<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.410> were<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.769> switched

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
means making sure you were then switched

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.220 
means making sure you were then switched
off<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.490> pull<00:00:29.730> cord<00:00:29.939> switch<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:30.840> you're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
off at the pull cord switch or if you're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.659 
off at the pull cord switch or if you're
one<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.560> these<00:00:31.679> statements<00:00:32.009> which<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> an

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
one of these statements which is an

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.819 
one of these statements which is an
isolation<00:00:33.300> switch<00:00:33.420> makes<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.290> switched<00:00:34.680> off

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
isolation switch makes you switched off

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.040 
isolation switch makes you switched off
at<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> isolation<00:00:35.579> switch<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.690> itself

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
at the isolation switch that in itself

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.650 
at the isolation switch that in itself
is<00:00:37.290> not<00:00:37.500> food<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.520> must<00:00:38.730> check<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
is not food at all you must check that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
is not food at all you must check that
if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> circuit<00:00:40.410> breaker<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
if you have a circuit breaker that you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
if you have a circuit breaker that you
switch<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> show<00:00:42.120> switch<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.540> power<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
switch the show switch to power at the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
switch the show switch to power at the
circuit<00:00:43.440> vehicle<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
circuit vehicle or if you're the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
circuit vehicle or if you're the
old-style<00:00:45.300> fuse<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.440> remove<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.980> fuse

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
old-style fuse you can remove the fuse

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
old-style fuse you can remove the fuse
before<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> start<00:00:48.000> once<00:00:48.780> you're<00:00:48.930> sure<00:00:49.020> that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
before you start once you're sure that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
before you start once you're sure that
there's<00:00:49.500> no<00:00:49.590> power<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> show<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
there's no power get into the show you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.740 
there's no power get into the show you
can<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.360> stain<00:00:51.780> sieve<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.710> remove<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.129> cover

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
can then stain sieve to remove the cover

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
can then stain sieve to remove the cover
so<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.680> probably<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.160> easiest<00:00:56.399> way<00:00:56.610> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
so I think probably the easiest way to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
so I think probably the easiest way to
go<00:00:56.850> about<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.690> we'll<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.199> through

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
go about this is that we'll look through

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
go about this is that we'll look through
the<00:00:59.070> components<00:01:00.030> from<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> point<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> view<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the components from the point of view of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
the components from the point of view of
the<00:01:00.930> water<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.579> we'll<00:01:02.789> go<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the water first and then we'll go on to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
the water first and then we'll go on to
the<00:01:03.270> electricity<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> water<00:01:05.250> comes

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the electricity so when the water comes

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
the electricity so when the water comes
into<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> show<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> switch<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.600> show<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
into the show and you switch a show and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
into the show and you switch a show and
the<00:01:07.110> first<00:01:07.380> thing<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> water<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the first thing that water is the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.520 
the first thing that water is the
solenoid<00:01:09.000> valve<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> thing<00:01:10.229> here

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
solenoid valve this is this thing here

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.399 
solenoid valve this is this thing here
and<00:01:11.000> it's<00:01:12.000> basically<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.600> on/off<00:01:12.990> switch<00:01:13.020> for

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and it's basically an on/off switch for

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
and it's basically an on/off switch for
the<00:01:13.799> water<00:01:13.979> benevolence<00:01:14.729> whose<00:01:14.970> power<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the water benevolence whose power the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
the water benevolence whose power the
coil<00:01:15.960> energizes<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.220> water<00:01:17.430> passes

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
coil energizes and the water passes

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.570 
coil energizes and the water passes
through<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.299> solenoid<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.100> water<00:01:20.100> link<00:01:20.400> was

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
through the solenoid the water link was

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640 
through the solenoid the water link was
on<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.060> next<00:01:21.299> thing<00:01:21.420> into<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> stabilizer

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
on the next thing into this stabilizer

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
on the next thing into this stabilizer
valve<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> flow<00:01:23.759> control<00:01:24.210> valve<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
valve or the flow control valve this is

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.950 
valve or the flow control valve this is
this<00:01:24.960> valve<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:26.509> when<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this valve here when some of the really

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
this valve here when some of the really
cheap<00:01:28.350> models<00:01:28.770> are<00:01:28.920> shows<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> they

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
cheap models are shows that the they

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.749 
cheap models are shows that the they
don't<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> solenoid<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:32.430> flow

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
don't have a solenoid and they flow

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
don't have a solenoid and they flow
control<00:01:33.150> valve<00:01:33.420> also<00:01:33.960> works<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.470> on/off

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
control valve also works as an on/off

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.950 
control valve also works as an on/off
valve<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.880> water<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.240> goes<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
valve so the water that goes into the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.130 
valve so the water that goes into the
flow<00:01:37.140> control<00:01:37.619> valve<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.930> full

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
flow control valve and and all the full

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.230 
flow control valve and and all the full
control<00:01:40.470> valves<00:01:40.920> does<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> small<00:01:41.549> paper<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
control valves does a small paper and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
control valves does a small paper and
adaptor<00:01:42.720> or<00:01:42.750> something<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.799> takes<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.340> into

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
adaptor or something it takes up into

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
see through to the elements but we'll

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.740 
see through to the elements but we'll
come<00:01:54.649> back<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:55.009> that<00:01:55.039> so<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.329> show<00:01:56.479> to

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
come back to that so for the show to

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.630 
come back to that so for the show to
work<00:01:56.929> with<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> water's<00:01:57.710> on<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.280> must<00:01:58.490> have

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
work with the water's on you must have

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.399 
work with the water's on you must have
enough<00:01:58.880> pressure<00:01:59.149> to<00:01:59.329> activate<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.170> pressure

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
enough pressure to activate the pressure

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.730 
enough pressure to activate the pressure
switch<00:02:00.969> but<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.600> other<00:02:02.810> thing<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.530> flow

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
switch but the other thing that the flow

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.410 
switch but the other thing that the flow
valve<00:02:03.979> does<00:02:04.219> is<00:02:04.429> it<00:02:04.579> orbiters<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
valve does is it orbiters the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.899 
valve does is it orbiters the
temperature<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:07.039> called<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.429> flow<00:02:07.640> valve

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
temperature and it's called a flow valve

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.570 
temperature and it's called a flow valve
because<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.330> fact<00:02:08.539> it<00:02:08.660> doesn't<00:02:09.080> really<00:02:09.580> alter

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
because in fact it doesn't really alter

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.280 
because in fact it doesn't really alter
the<00:02:10.879> temperature<00:02:11.120> what<00:02:11.599> it<00:02:11.780> does<00:02:11.959> do<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.200> it

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the temperature what it does do is it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.440 
the temperature what it does do is it
alters<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.769> flow<00:02:13.060> speed<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.299> water

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
alters the flow speed of the water

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.970 
alters the flow speed of the water
through<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.900> thin<00:02:15.260> crack<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:15.830> this

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
through the thin crack this is this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.550 
through the thin crack this is this
thing<00:02:16.220> here<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.870> what<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.019> does<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.530> that

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
thing here and what this does is that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.550 
thing here and what this does is that
they<00:02:18.920> as<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.239> quicker<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.930> water<00:02:21.140> flows

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
they as the quicker the water flows

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.610 
they as the quicker the water flows
through<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:22.060> they<00:02:23.060> cooler<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.110> shoulders

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
through here they cooler the shoulders

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.589 
through here they cooler the shoulders
and<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.980> more<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.340> slow<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.700> water<00:02:25.819> down<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
and the more you slow the water down the

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.030 
and the more you slow the water down the
more<00:02:26.810> chance<00:02:27.079> they<00:02:27.200> get<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.440> eat<00:02:27.530> up<00:02:27.769> anything

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
more chance they get to eat up anything

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.490 
more chance they get to eat up anything
tank<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.180> hotter<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.690> water<00:02:29.900> gets<00:02:30.260> and

tank and the hotter the water gets and
that's<00:02:31.280> really<00:02:31.640> very<00:02:31.819> basically<00:02:32.660> what

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
that's really very basically what

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.259 
that's really very basically what

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
too hot the thermal cutter went a low

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.319 
too hot the thermal cutter went a low
power<00:02:57.049> flew<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> elements<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:59.000> we'll

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
power flew to the elements but we'll

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.059 
power flew to the elements but we'll
assume<00:02:59.630> that<00:02:59.690> we've<00:03:00.049> switched<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.560> shower<00:03:00.799> on

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
assume that we've switched the shower on

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.580 
assume that we've switched the shower on
the<00:03:01.760> water<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.239> heating<00:03:02.600> tank<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.019> cool<00:03:03.350> and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
the water that heating tank is cool and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.490 
the water that heating tank is cool and
so<00:03:04.130> therefore<00:03:04.519> thermal<00:03:04.819> cutter<00:03:05.500> recognizes

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
so therefore thermal cutter recognizes

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.470 
so therefore thermal cutter recognizes
of<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.650> waters<00:03:06.950> cruel<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.639> allows<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.239> heat

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
of the waters cruel and allows the heat

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.629 
of the waters cruel and allows the heat

going to the switches the switches are

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.140 
going to the switches the switches are
in<00:03:15.019> here<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.519> top<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:17.000> this

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150

pressure<00:03:17.450> switch<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.019> as<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:18.950> mentioned

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
pressure switch and as I mentioned

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.979 
pressure switch and as I mentioned
before<00:03:19.459> if<00:03:19.940> there's<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.180> lot<00:03:20.329> water<00:03:20.569> pressure

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
before if there's a lot water pressure

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.159 
before if there's a lot water pressure
it<00:03:21.680> pushes<00:03:22.340> these<00:03:22.549> up<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.480> switches<00:03:23.930> then

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
it pushes these up and the switches then

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.530 
it pushes these up and the switches then
switch<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.560> power<00:03:24.950> through<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.000> elements

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
switch the power through to the elements

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.390 
switch the power through to the elements
and<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:27.260> power<00:03:27.440> comes<00:03:27.680> from<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.950> switches

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
and the power comes from the switches

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.159 
and the power comes from the switches
through<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:28.940> elements<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.989> water

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
through to the elements and the water

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.920 
through to the elements and the water
heats<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.919> that's<00:03:31.790> basically<00:03:32.329> how<00:03:32.419> an

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
heats up and that's basically how an

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.740 
heats up and that's basically how an
electric<00:03:33.560> shower<00:03:33.709> works<00:03:34.299> so<00:03:35.299> to<00:03:35.450> help

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
electric shower works so to help

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.750 
electric shower works so to help
identify<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.440> components<00:03:37.099> and<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.579> is<00:03:37.730> a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
identify the components and this is a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.580 
identify the components and this is a
galaxy<00:03:38.180> show<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.930> can<00:03:39.169> show<00:03:39.319> you<00:03:39.380> that

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
galaxy show but I can show you that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.710 
galaxy show but I can show you that
there<00:03:39.769> has<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.250> fact<00:03:40.430> all<00:03:40.700> exactly<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> same

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
there has in fact all exactly the same

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.420 
there has in fact all exactly the same
components<00:03:42.410> as<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.739> tranqued<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.220> when<00:03:43.340> they

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
components as the tranqued and when they

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.580 
components as the tranqued and when they
have<00:03:43.519> at<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> back<00:03:43.970> here<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.410> when<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.500> get

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
have at the back here and when you get

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.099 
have at the back here and when you get
familiar<00:03:45.829> with<00:03:46.549> look<00:03:47.450> at<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.690> look<00:03:47.870> at<00:03:47.959> these

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
familiar with look at the look at these

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.180 
familiar with look at the look at these
components<00:03:48.290> you'll<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.769> able<00:03:48.829> to<00:03:49.010> recognize

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
components you'll be able to recognize

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.819 
components you'll be able to recognize
all<00:03:49.639> are<00:03:49.940> exactly<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.019> same<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.260> should<00:03:51.440> know

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
all are exactly the same you should know

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.250 
all are exactly the same you should know
what<00:03:52.459> they<00:03:52.639> do<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.419> once<00:03:53.630> again<00:03:53.780> we've<00:03:54.049> got<00:03:54.169> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
what they do so once again we've got the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.540 
what they do so once again we've got the
solenoid<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.919> comes<00:03:55.099> in<00:03:55.250> two

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
solenoid it comes in two

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.880 
solenoid it comes in two
into<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.060> show<00:03:56.240> above<00:03:56.990> it<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.290> floor<00:03:57.560> valve

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
into the show above it the floor valve

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.460 
into the show above it the floor valve
and<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.790> case<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.540> pressure<00:04:00.110> switch<00:04:00.440> is

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
and in this case the pressure switch is

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.040 
and in this case the pressure switch is
not<00:04:00.850> directly<00:04:01.850> connected<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.630> floor<00:04:02.810> well

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
not directly connected to the floor well

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.470 
not directly connected to the floor well
it's<00:04:03.500> up<00:04:03.770> here<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:04.970> pressure<00:04:05.120> that

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
it's up here and so the pressure that

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.090 
it's up here and so the pressure that
our<00:04:05.600> paper<00:04:05.810> was<00:04:05.990> up<00:04:06.140> here<00:04:06.410> that's<00:04:06.680> when<00:04:06.830> here

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
our paper was up here that's when here

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.220 
our paper was up here that's when here
as<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.520> can<00:04:07.580> see<00:04:07.670> that<00:04:07.910> variable<00:04:08.330> into<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
as you can see that variable into the

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.200 
as you can see that variable into the
pressure<00:04:09.560> switch<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.640> pressure<00:04:10.880> switch

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
pressure switch and the pressure switch

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.480 
pressure switch and the pressure switch
is<00:04:11.240> here<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.900> as<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.860> can<00:04:12.890> see<00:04:13.190> in<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.430> one

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
is here and as you can see in this one

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.850 
is here and as you can see in this one
the<00:04:14.090> two<00:04:14.300> switches<00:04:14.540> are<00:04:14.870> mounted<00:04:15.170> here<00:04:15.410> so

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
the two switches are mounted here so

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.699 
the two switches are mounted here so
when<00:04:16.160> water<00:04:16.610> pressure<00:04:17.060> comes<00:04:17.420> on<00:04:17.650> lifts<00:04:18.650> a

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
when water pressure comes on lifts a

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.070 
when water pressure comes on lifts a
diaphragm<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.400> here<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.420> powerless<00:04:20.810> then

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
diaphragm in here and the powerless then

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.050 
diaphragm in here and the powerless then
switch<00:04:21.410> through<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.220> heating<00:04:22.490> time<00:04:22.700> and

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
switch through to the heating time and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.860 
switch through to the heating time and
so<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.260> key<00:04:24.380> thing<00:04:24.530> time<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
so this is the key thing time the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.580 
so this is the key thing time the
different<00:04:26.870> different<00:04:27.410> shape<00:04:27.560> different

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
different different shape different

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.000 
different different shape different
color<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.720> previous<00:04:29.720> one<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.020> at<00:04:30.860> the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
color to the previous one and at the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.170 
color to the previous one and at the
very<00:04:31.190> top<00:04:31.490> we<00:04:31.940> have<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:33.250> thermal<00:04:34.250> cutout<00:04:34.460> so

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
very top we have the thermal cutout so

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.660 
very top we have the thermal cutout so
all<00:04:35.450> of<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.890> components<00:04:36.890> of<00:04:37.040> exactly<00:04:37.490> the

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
all of the components of exactly the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.300 
all of the components of exactly the
same<00:04:37.840> initial<00:04:38.840> as<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.620> armor<00:04:39.890> than<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.160> other

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
same initial as the armor than the other

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
same initial as the armor than the other
ones<00:04:40.660> okay<00:04:41.660> so<00:04:41.780> just<00:04:41.960> once<00:04:42.740> again<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.070> help<00:04:43.330> you

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
ones okay so just once again to help you

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.570 
ones okay so just once again to help you
see<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.200> different<00:04:45.500> parts<00:04:45.650> on<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:45.950> show<00:04:46.130> this

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
see the different parts on the show this

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.220 
see the different parts on the show this
is<00:04:46.640> our<00:04:46.850> entering<00:04:47.240> shows<00:04:47.450> is<00:04:47.660> slightly<00:04:48.080> better

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
is our entering shows is slightly better

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.340 
is our entering shows is slightly better
quality<00:04:48.380> show<00:04:48.950> than<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.190> previous<00:04:49.640> ones<00:04:49.850> and

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
quality show than the previous ones and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.810 
quality show than the previous ones and
it<00:04:51.350> has<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.770> connector<00:04:52.220> what<00:04:52.430> will<00:04:52.580> occur

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
it has the connector what will occur

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.690 
it has the connector what will occur
comes<00:04:53.120> in<00:04:53.590> then<00:04:54.590> both<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.040> you<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.250> solenoid

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
comes in then both of you the solenoid

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.730 
comes in then both of you the solenoid
valve<00:04:55.940> uses<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.420> different<00:04:56.570> color<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.140> this<00:04:57.680> is

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
valve uses a different color and this is

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.680 
valve uses a different color and this is
the<00:04:57.890> floor<00:04:58.310> control<00:04:58.730> the<00:04:58.940> floor<00:04:59.150> valve<00:04:59.420> here

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
the floor control the floor valve here

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.400 
the floor control the floor valve here
and<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.980> intersects<00:05:01.610> moves<00:05:01.820> red<00:05:02.060> like<00:05:02.240> that

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
and this intersects moves red like that

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.200 
and this intersects moves red like that
you<00:05:03.410> can<00:05:03.560> see<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:04.220> pretty<00:05:04.460> similar<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
you can see it's pretty similar to the

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.090 
you can see it's pretty similar to the
other<00:05:05.330> ones<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:05.780> topped<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.680> here<00:05:06.919> is<00:05:07.070> a

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
other ones and topped it here is a

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.070 
other ones and topped it here is a
pressure<00:05:07.430> switch<00:05:07.730> with<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.540> two<00:05:08.870> switches

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
pressure switch with the two switches

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.260 
pressure switch with the two switches
are<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.620> power<00:05:09.980> on<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.490> go<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.669> the<00:05:10.880> elements

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
are the power on to go to the elements

the<00:05:11.990> heating<00:05:12.320> tank<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.890> should<00:05:13.100> be<00:05:13.220> able<00:05:13.280> to

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
the heating tank you should be able to

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.340 
the heating tank you should be able to
recognize<00:05:13.760> that<00:05:14.090> by<00:05:14.300> now<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.870> then<00:05:15.110> plot<00:05:15.320> the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
recognize that by now and then plot the

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.530 
recognize that by now and then plot the
thermal<00:05:15.860> cutter<00:05:16.130> here<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.790> black<00:05:17.030> thing<00:05:17.360> with

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
thermal cutter here the black thing with

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.350 
thermal cutter here the black thing with
the<00:05:18.080> wiring<00:05:18.350> and<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:19.070> either<00:05:19.220> say<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:20.210> is

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
the wiring and to either say this is

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.120 
the wiring and to either say this is
slightly<00:05:20.630> more<00:05:20.900> sophisticated<00:05:21.080> then<00:05:21.980> it's

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
slightly more sophisticated then it's

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.380 
slightly more sophisticated then it's
got<00:05:22.310> a<00:05:22.340> time<00:05:22.700> delay<00:05:23.090> on<00:05:23.210> it

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
got a time delay on it

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.240 
got a time delay on it
so<00:05:23.840> that<00:05:23.990> when<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.230> switch<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.740> show<00:05:24.919> off

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
so that when you switch the show off

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.310 
so that when you switch the show off
what<00:05:25.550> happens<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.690> keeps<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.169> show

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
what happens is it it keeps the show

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.650 
what happens is it it keeps the show
running<00:05:27.620> for<00:05:27.980> probably<00:05:28.700> five<00:05:28.910> or<00:05:29.060> ten<00:05:29.240> seconds

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
running for probably five or ten seconds

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.960 
running for probably five or ten seconds
afterwards<00:05:30.169> just<00:05:30.380> allowed<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:31.370> let<00:05:31.520> some<00:05:31.700> cold

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
afterwards just allowed to let some cold

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.540 
afterwards just allowed to let some cold
water<00:05:32.180> run<00:05:32.540> into<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.870> heating<00:05:33.169> tank<00:05:33.550> and

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
water run into the heating tank and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.890 
water run into the heating tank and
that's<00:05:34.760> these<00:05:35.150> are<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.360> kind<00:05:35.540> of<00:05:35.600> things<00:05:35.780> you

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
that's these are the kind of things you

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.240 
that's these are the kind of things you
get<00:05:36.050> when<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.290> start<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.590> be<00:05:36.740> a<00:05:36.770> little<00:05:37.010> bit

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
get when you start to be a little bit

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.170 
get when you start to be a little bit
bored<00:05:37.460> for<00:05:37.640> sure

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
bored for sure

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.990 
bored for sure
so<00:05:38.480> looking<00:05:38.780> at<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.490> faults<00:05:40.490> that<00:05:40.610> normally

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
so looking at the faults that normally

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.240 
so looking at the faults that normally
go<00:05:41.120> on<00:05:41.150> electrical<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.050> show<00:05:42.320> it's<00:05:42.830> possibly

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
go on electrical the show it's possibly

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.920 
go on electrical the show it's possibly
the<00:05:43.340> solenoid<00:05:43.850> involved<00:05:44.210> someone<00:05:44.540> on<00:05:44.660> valve

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
the solenoid involved someone on valve

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.080 
the solenoid involved someone on valve
and<00:05:45.169> when<00:05:46.070> that<00:05:46.160> starts<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.580> go<00:05:46.700> fault<00:05:46.940> it

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
and when that starts to go fault it

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.460 
and when that starts to go fault it
usually<00:05:47.480> just<00:05:47.660> cuts<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:47.990> show<00:05:48.230> off

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
usually just cuts the show off

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.400 
usually just cuts the show off
completely<00:05:49.060> sometimes<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.210> has<00:05:50.900> I<00:05:50.930> sense<00:05:51.260> that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
completely sometimes it has I sense that

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.200 
completely sometimes it has I sense that
anything<00:05:51.650> issue<00:05:51.919> that<00:05:52.280> cuts<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.760> water<00:05:53.000> off

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
anything issue that cuts the water off

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.560 
anything issue that cuts the water off
when<00:05:53.450> your<00:05:53.600> ears<00:05:53.930> full<00:05:54.710> of<00:05:54.830> soap<00:05:55.330> that's<00:05:56.330> not

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
when your ears full of soap that's not

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.780 
when your ears full of soap that's not
really<00:05:56.810> true<00:05:56.960> but<00:05:57.530> in<00:05:57.770> truth<00:05:58.220> what<00:05:58.460> does<00:05:58.640> go

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
really true but in truth what does go

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.550 
really true but in truth what does go
wrong<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:59.060> this<00:05:59.180> often<00:05:59.540> cuts<00:05:59.780> out<00:05:59.960> after<00:06:00.380> about

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
wrong is this often cuts out after about

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.620 
wrong is this often cuts out after about
two<00:06:00.860> minutes<00:06:01.010> and<00:06:01.370> after<00:06:02.120> two<00:06:02.330> minute

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
two minutes and after two minute

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.750 
two minutes and after two minute
shut<00:06:03.200> the<00:06:03.290> shirt<00:06:03.470> off<00:06:03.890> probably<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.580> few

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
shut the shirt off probably a few

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.190 
shut the shirt off probably a few
minutes<00:06:04.970> after<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.390> it<00:06:05.540> will<00:06:05.630> come<00:06:05.810> back<00:06:05.840> on

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
minutes after that it will come back on

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.990 
minutes after that it will come back on
again<00:06:06.320> so<00:06:06.620> if<00:06:06.950> you<00:06:07.040> finish<00:06:07.340> your<00:06:07.370> shopping<00:06:07.730> on

again so if you finish your shopping on

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.540 
again so if you finish your shopping on
and<00:06:08.570> off<00:06:08.690> when<00:06:09.350> you're<00:06:09.530> in<00:06:09.620> the<00:06:09.770> show<00:06:09.950> the

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
you know if they seldom go wrong but you

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.090 
you know if they seldom go wrong but you
may<00:06:17.390> find<00:06:17.750> that<00:06:17.930> they<00:06:18.140> if<00:06:18.530> you<00:06:18.770> turn<00:06:18.980> the

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
temperature in the hot water tank is too

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.320 
temperature in the hot water tank is too
hot<00:06:47.420> then<00:06:48.170> it<00:06:48.200> cut<00:06:48.680> so<00:06:48.920> the<00:06:49.490> problem<00:06:49.940> is<00:06:50.000> as

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
hot then it cut so the problem is as

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.260 
hot then it cut so the problem is as
this<00:06:50.480> happens<00:06:50.960> in<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.140> regular<00:06:51.740> basis<00:06:52.220> then<00:06:52.940> the

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
this happens in a regular basis then the

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.680 
this happens in a regular basis then the
sauna<00:06:54.110> that<00:06:54.350> the<00:06:54.590> thermal<00:06:55.520> cutter<00:06:55.760> will<00:06:56.360> feel

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
sauna that the thermal cutter will feel

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.810 
sauna that the thermal cutter will feel
and<00:06:57.020> you<00:06:57.740> need<00:06:57.890> to<00:06:58.010> replace<00:06:58.280> the<00:06:58.460> thermal

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
and you need to replace the thermal

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.120 
and you need to replace the thermal
cutting<00:06:59.060> the<00:06:59.720> next<00:07:00.110> thing<00:07:00.290> to<00:07:00.500> look<00:07:00.530> for<00:07:00.920> is

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
cutting the next thing to look for is

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.130 
cutting the next thing to look for is
one<00:07:01.670> of<00:07:01.760> the<00:07:01.880> elements<00:07:02.360> going<00:07:02.630> in<00:07:02.750> the<00:07:02.840> heating

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
one of the elements going in the heating

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.140 
one of the elements going in the heating
tank<00:07:03.380> and<00:07:03.770> what<00:07:04.040> normally<00:07:04.430> happens<00:07:04.460> with<00:07:05.000> the

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:05.150 
tank and what normally happens with the

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.330 
tank and what normally happens with the
elements<00:07:05.510> is<00:07:05.630> you<00:07:05.750> get<00:07:05.870> half<00:07:06.230> hour<00:07:06.620> you've<00:07:07.220> got

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
elements is you get half hour you've got

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.580 
elements is you get half hour you've got
to<00:07:07.430> turn<00:07:07.580> the<00:07:07.700> show<00:07:07.880> up<00:07:08.090> as<00:07:08.690> hot<00:07:09.050> as<00:07:09.200> it'll<00:07:09.410> go

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
to turn the show up as hot as it'll go

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.040 
to turn the show up as hot as it'll go
but<00:07:10.160> you<00:07:10.310> lose<00:07:10.520> the<00:07:10.760> flu<00:07:11.030> because<00:07:11.600> you're<00:07:11.930> only

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
but you lose the flu because you're only

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.440 
but you lose the flu because you're only
really<00:07:12.320> working<00:07:12.740> with<00:07:12.860> one<00:07:13.040> Elm<00:07:13.250> and<00:07:13.580> very

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:14.450 
really working with one Elm and very

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.920 
really working with one Elm and very
briefly<00:07:15.100> if<00:07:16.100> the<00:07:16.340> shed<00:07:16.550> has<00:07:16.700> no<00:07:17.030> water<00:07:17.720> the

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
briefly if the shed has no water the

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.870 
briefly if the shed has no water the
water<00:07:18.110> is<00:07:18.230> absolutely<00:07:18.470> cooled<00:07:19.100> the<00:07:19.550> first

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
water is absolutely cooled the first

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.490 
water is absolutely cooled the first
thing<00:07:20.090> to<00:07:20.210> look<00:07:20.330> at<00:07:20.480> is<00:07:20.690> the<00:07:20.900> thermal<00:07:21.260> cutout

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
thing to look at is the thermal cutout

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.950 
thing to look at is the thermal cutout
and<00:07:21.860> if<00:07:22.250> there<00:07:22.400> is<00:07:22.490> some<00:07:22.790> heat<00:07:23.030> then<00:07:23.330> I<00:07:23.600> will

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
and if there is some heat then I will

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.040 
and if there is some heat then I will
look<00:07:24.050> at<00:07:24.170> the<00:07:24.500> eating<00:07:24.800> tank
