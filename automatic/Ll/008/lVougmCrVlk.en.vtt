00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
will be different so I'm starting off by
taking<00:00:45.090> everything<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.200> picture

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
frame

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.889 
frame
I<00:00:47.039> took<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.340> backing<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.300> paper<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
I took the backing out the paper that it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
I took the backing out the paper that it
comes<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.559> also<00:00:49.710> took<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.579> frame

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
comes with I also took out the frame

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
comes with I also took out the frame
that<00:00:51.239> comes<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> frame<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that comes in the frame and also the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
that comes in the frame and also the
glass<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:54.000> coming<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
glass so that's all coming out of the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.520 
glass so that's all coming out of the
main<00:00:55.559> picture<00:00:55.980> frame<00:00:59.930> now<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.260> tracing

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
main picture frame now I'm just tracing

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.560 
main picture frame now I'm just tracing
the<00:01:01.800> back<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> frame<00:01:02.609> onto<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.210> cork

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the back of the frame onto the cork

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.929 
the back of the frame onto the cork
because<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> cork<00:01:04.680> tiles<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.790> bit

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because the cork tiles are a little bit

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.210 
because the cork tiles are a little bit
too<00:01:06.119> big<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> cut<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> wanted

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
too big I have to cut it so I wanted

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.340 
too big I have to cut it so I wanted
that<00:01:08.430> same<00:01:08.729> size<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.750> back<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.110> frame

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
that same size of the back of the frame

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
that same size of the back of the frame
that<00:01:10.380> way<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> fits<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> main<00:01:11.670> frame<00:01:12.090> so

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that way it fits in the main frame so

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
that way it fits in the main frame so
then<00:01:12.900> once<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> back<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:14.130> traced<00:01:14.700> I'm

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
then once the back is all traced I'm

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
then once the back is all traced I'm
just<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.330> cut<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.080> some

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just going to cut it out with some

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.600 
just going to cut it out with some
scissors<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.340> pretty<00:01:17.520> easy

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
scissors and it was actually pretty easy

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
scissors and it was actually pretty easy
I<00:01:17.939> thought<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:18.479> first<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.810> was<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:18.930> oh<00:01:19.170> no<00:01:19.350> do

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
I thought at first I was like oh no do

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.350 
I thought at first I was like oh no do
we<00:01:19.590> need<00:01:19.710> special<00:01:19.950> scissors<00:01:20.220> nope<00:01:20.970> regular

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
we need special scissors nope regular

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.490 
we need special scissors nope regular
scissors<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.960> fine

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
scissors are fine

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.569 
scissors are fine
cut<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.100> super<00:01:23.670> simple<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> easy

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.039 

so<00:01:32.579> once<00:01:32.789> I<00:01:32.909> cut<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.179> cork<00:01:33.420> out<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so once I cut the cork out I want to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.480 
so once I cut the cork out I want to
make<00:01:34.170> sure<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.649> actually<00:01:35.039> fits<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.399> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
make sure that it actually fits in the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
make sure that it actually fits in the
frame<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> testing<00:01:37.079> making

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
frame so I'm just kind of testing making

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
frame so I'm just kind of testing making
short<00:01:37.799> fits<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> does<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.149> don't<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
short fits and it does I don't want to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
short fits and it does I don't want to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
do a ton of work to the cork and then it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.719 
do a ton of work to the cork and then it
not<00:01:41.700> fit<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> cork<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> packet<00:01:44.399> came

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
not fit so now the cork the packet came

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.600 
not fit so now the cork the packet came
with<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.240> ton<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.929> double-sided<00:01:46.610> pieces

scrapbook paper and I'm cutting it into

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
scrapbook paper and I'm cutting it into
a<00:02:35.760> little<00:02:36.239> square<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.720> actually<00:02:36.900> using<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
a little square I'm actually using the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.640 
a little square I'm actually using the
other<00:02:37.590> frame<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.250> came<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> frame<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
other frame that came with the frame and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.020 
other frame that came with the frame and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
I'm just gonna cut it out and I thought

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.940 
I'm just gonna cut it out and I thought
this<00:02:42.239> square<00:02:42.600> was<00:02:42.810> gonna<00:02:42.959> go<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.709> bottom

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
this square was gonna go on the bottom

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.610 
this square was gonna go on the bottom
right<00:02:44.310> hand<00:02:44.489> corner<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.299> ended<00:02:45.720> up<00:02:45.840> putting

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
right hand corner but I ended up putting

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.640 
right hand corner but I ended up putting
it<00:02:46.859> on<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> top<00:02:47.489> left<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.420> don't<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.560> it's

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
it on the top left I don't know so it's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.470 
it on the top left I don't know so it's
gonna<00:02:49.799> go<00:02:50.010> right<00:02:50.400> there<00:02:50.639> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.180> cork<00:02:51.450> board

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
gonna go right there on the cork board

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.140 
gonna go right there on the cork board
and<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.560> paste<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.130> down<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> actually<00:02:53.700> used

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and to paste it down I actually used

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.020 
and to paste it down I actually used
this<00:02:54.569> fabric<00:02:55.170> tape<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:56.340> wanted<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.730> dark

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
this fabric tape and I wanted a dark

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.879 
this fabric tape and I wanted a dark
color<00:02:57.269> because<00:02:57.480> everything<00:02:57.989> was<00:02:58.079> so<00:02:58.139> light<00:02:58.590> so

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
color because everything was so light so

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.259 
color because everything was so light so
I<00:02:59.099> don't<00:02:59.489> know<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.730> thought<00:02:59.910> it<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.239> a

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
I don't know I thought it was like a

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.849 
I don't know I thought it was like a
nice<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.630> pop<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.019> color<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.530> has<00:03:01.680> like

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
nice little pop of color and it has like

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.250 
nice little pop of color and it has like
a<00:03:01.920> floral<00:03:02.400> design<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.090> I'm<00:03:03.569> just<00:03:03.720> taping<00:03:03.959> that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
a floral design and I'm just taping that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
a floral design and I'm just taping that
down<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.099> then<00:03:05.250> kind<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.760> overlapping<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
down and then kind of overlapping the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.930 
down and then kind of overlapping the
tape<00:03:06.720> around<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.769> back<00:03:08.010> end<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> cork

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
tape around the back end of the cork

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180 
tape around the back end of the cork
board<00:03:09.150> by<00:03:09.810> making<00:03:10.139> sense<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.799> everything

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
board by making sense so that everything

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.280 
board by making sense so that everything
is<00:03:11.280> stuck<00:03:11.639> down<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.720> that's<00:03:12.840> what<00:03:13.109> that<00:03:13.139> looks

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
is stuck down so that's what that looks

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.319 
is stuck down so that's what that looks
like<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.889> then<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.190> time<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.819> put<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
like and then it's time to just put the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.569 
like and then it's time to just put the
cork<00:03:15.720> board<00:03:15.900> into<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.349> frame<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.340> cork

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
cork board into the frame and the cork

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:31.330 
cork board into the frame and the cork
board<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.910> pretty<00:03:18.120> much<00:03:18.329> done

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.740 

so<00:03:32.340> now<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.670> corkboard<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.180> done<00:03:33.450> I'm

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
so now that the corkboard is done I'm

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.060
