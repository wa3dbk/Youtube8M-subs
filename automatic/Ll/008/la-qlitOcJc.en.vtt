00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.599 
pan on the bottom there logo stamped on
there<00:02:05.799> so<00:02:06.799> essentially<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.310> looks<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.579> a

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
there so essentially it looks like a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:12.460 
there so essentially it looks like a
Pepsi<00:02:07.999> can<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:09.410> bottom<00:02:09.860> it's<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.880> nice<00:02:11.780> cutout

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
Pepsi can the bottom it's a nice cutout

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.199 
Pepsi can the bottom it's a nice cutout
here<00:02:13.300> just<00:02:14.300> inside<00:02:15.080> there<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.890> smaller<00:02:16.760> can

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
here just inside there is a smaller can

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.280 
here just inside there is a smaller can
with<00:02:18.080> holes<00:02:18.380> through<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.860> top<00:02:19.130> there<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.900> pass

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
with holes through the top there to pass

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.740 
with holes through the top there to pass
the<00:02:21.560> gas<00:02:21.800> through<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.550> looks<00:02:22.820> like<00:02:23.120> that's

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the gas through and it looks like that's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.590 
the gas through and it looks like that's
maybe<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.200> Red<00:02:24.410> Bull<00:02:24.440> can

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
maybe a Red Bull can

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.950

of<00:02:48.420> water<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.740> bulge

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of water right to that bulge

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.160 
of water right to that bulge
I<00:02:50.340> don't<00:02:51.090> also<00:02:52.040> here's<00:02:53.040> their<00:02:53.250> windscreen

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
I don't also here's their windscreen

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.330 
I don't also here's their windscreen
it's<00:02:55.170> very<00:02:55.410> nice<00:02:55.620> design<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.610> done<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:58.350> so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it's very nice design just done it so

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.500 
it's very nice design just done it so
you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.580> see<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.180> got<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.330> little

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
you can see that it's got a little

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.160 
you can see that it's got a little
channel<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.200> there<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.730> these<00:03:02.730> channels<00:03:03.170> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
channel on there and these channels just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.820 
channel on there and these channels just
fit<00:03:05.100> into<00:03:05.940> each<00:03:06.180> other<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:07.170> it's<00:03:07.290> now<00:03:07.500> sauna

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
fit into each other so it's now sauna

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.940 
fit into each other so it's now sauna
that's<00:03:08.100> what<00:03:08.250> creates<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.700> shape<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.950> over

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that's what creates that shape so over

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.240 
that's what creates that shape so over
the<00:03:11.070> stove<00:03:13.940> peg<00:03:14.940> can<00:03:15.240> write<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.320> lip<00:03:16.740> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the stove peg can write to that lip and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.370 
the stove peg can write to that lip and
you're<00:03:18.060> all<00:03:18.180> set

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
you're all set

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.030 
you're all set

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
time and test it now I'm not sure if you

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.200 
time and test it now I'm not sure if you
can<00:03:41.250> see<00:03:41.460> that<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:43.070> stoves<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.520> in<00:03:44.670> there

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.850 

and<00:03:48.210> you<00:03:48.600> start<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.900> timer<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.410> test<00:03:49.680> will

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
and you start the timer this test will

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.980 
and you start the timer this test will
be<00:03:49.950> conducted<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.640> same<00:03:50.850> 15<00:03:51.360> milliliters

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
be conducted as the same 15 milliliters

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.380 
be conducted as the same 15 milliliters
as<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.290> did<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.560> other<00:03:52.680> test<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.910> two<00:03:54.060> cups<00:03:54.240> of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
as I did the other test with two cups of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.890 
as I did the other test with two cups of
water<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:55.140> we'll<00:03:56.100> see<00:03:56.250> how<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.459> does<00:03:56.840> now<00:03:57.840> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
water and we'll see how it does now the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.830 
water and we'll see how it does now the
only<00:03:58.140> difference<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.980> can<00:03:59.880> see<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.180> their<00:04:00.420> keg

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
only difference I can see with their keg

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
only difference I can see with their keg
design<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.850> that<00:04:02.850> most<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.860> caldera

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
design is that most of the caldera

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.770 
design is that most of the caldera
coatings<00:04:07.190> are<00:04:08.190> designed<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.540> be<00:04:11.750> have<00:04:12.750> a

coatings are designed to be have a

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.020 
coatings are designed to be have a
little<00:04:12.870> pop<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.650> here<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.040> what<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.610> does<00:04:14.790> is

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
little pop in here and what it does is

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.770 
little pop in here and what it does is
right<00:04:15.690> there<00:04:16.020> it<00:04:16.760> fits<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.970> lip<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:19.580> say<00:04:20.780> the

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
right there it fits the lip of say the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.310 
right there it fits the lip of say the
Snow<00:04:22.020> Peak<00:04:22.049> right<00:04:22.860> there<00:04:23.040> at<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.220> top<00:04:23.460> lip<00:04:24.000> is

Snow Peak right there at the top lip is

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.260 
Snow Peak right there at the top lip is
where<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.470> will<00:04:25.620> catch<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.880> I'll<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:27.240> a

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
where it will catch and I'll have a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.310 
where it will catch and I'll have a
little<00:04:27.600> cut<00:04:27.900> out<00:04:27.930> there<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:29.090> where<00:04:30.090> the

and uninsulated but that's mostly just
hot<00:04:51.030> air<00:04:51.060> space<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:51.950> it<00:04:53.270> should<00:04:54.270> be<00:04:54.420> alright

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
hot air space so it should be alright

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.260 
hot air space so it should be alright
and<00:04:55.080> we'll<00:04:55.320> see<00:04:55.590> how<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:55.800> goes<00:04:56.060> again<00:04:57.060> it's

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
and we'll see how it goes again it's

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.510 
and we'll see how it goes again it's
super<00:04:57.540> high<00:04:57.810> quality<00:04:58.290> very<00:04:58.770> happy<00:04:59.190> with<00:04:59.340> it

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
super high quality very happy with it

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.830 
super high quality very happy with it
and<00:04:59.640> yes<00:04:59.820> you<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.060> probably<00:05:00.330> try<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.600> make<00:05:00.810> it

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
and yes you can probably try and make it

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.140 
and yes you can probably try and make it
yourself<00:05:01.020> but<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:01.740> mean<00:05:02.310> some<00:05:02.640> of<00:05:02.670> the<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:03.030> know

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
yourself but I mean some of the you know

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.490 
yourself but I mean some of the you know
with<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.510> crimp<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.020> there<00:05:04.230> you're<00:05:04.410> gonna

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
with that crimp in there you're gonna

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.950 
with that crimp in there you're gonna
need<00:05:04.650> special<00:05:05.040> dyes<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.640> thought<00:05:06.570> about<00:05:06.690> making

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
need special dyes I thought about making

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.260 
need special dyes I thought about making
the<00:05:07.320> cone<00:05:07.620> myself<00:05:08.310> but<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:08.760> know<00:05:08.880> what<00:05:09.060> that's

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
the cone myself but you know what that's

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.960 
the cone myself but you know what that's
super<00:05:10.170> high<00:05:10.290> quality<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.920> I<00:05:11.070> don't<00:05:11.640> think<00:05:11.850> you

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
super high quality and I don't think you

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.840 
super high quality and I don't think you
could<00:05:12.180> match<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.350> quality<00:05:13.590> for<00:05:14.550> your<00:05:14.670> home

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
could match the quality for your home

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.610 
could match the quality for your home
version<00:05:15.330> so<00:05:17.750> alright<00:05:18.750> we're<00:05:19.020> three<00:05:19.350> minutes

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
version so alright we're three minutes

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.790 
version so alright we're three minutes

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
have a boil now this is actually my

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.460 
have a boil now this is actually my
second<00:06:16.710> attempt<00:06:17.430> 15<00:06:18.300> milliliters<00:06:18.870> died<00:06:19.169> right

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
second attempt 15 milliliters died right

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.470 
second attempt 15 milliliters died right
about<00:06:19.770> six<00:06:20.190> minutes<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:20.790> I<00:06:20.850> had<00:06:21.030> some<00:06:21.240> fast

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
about six minutes and I had some fast

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.090 
about six minutes and I had some fast
bubbles<00:06:22.020> going<00:06:22.410> but<00:06:23.280> ran<00:06:24.060> out<00:06:24.210> of<00:06:24.240> fuel<00:06:24.510> so<00:06:25.100> I

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
bubbles going but ran out of fuel so I

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.570 
bubbles going but ran out of fuel so I
imagine<00:06:26.640> it<00:06:26.760> like<00:06:26.880> 17<00:06:27.570> or<00:06:27.930> so<00:06:28.380> and<00:06:29.130> probably<00:06:29.250> a

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
imagine it like 17 or so and probably a

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.610 
imagine it like 17 or so and probably a
perfect<00:06:30.000> boil<00:06:30.210> i<00:06:30.650> I<00:06:31.650> put<00:06:32.040> 20<00:06:32.580> in<00:06:33.350> just<00:06:34.350> be<00:06:34.530> on

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.500 
the safe side and we're gonna let it run
clearly<00:06:37.080> out<00:06:37.320> of<00:06:37.350> boil

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510
