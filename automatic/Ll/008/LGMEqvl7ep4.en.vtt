00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.840
 a lot of people I hope you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 go well today we find ourselves 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.770
 to speak routine summer hue since 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.269
 for a few weeks I have a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.710
 new routine for the complexion with the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.519
 new products that I discovered and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.440
 that I love 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.009
 and so here I wanted to share that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.009
 with you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.310
 tone up using this product there 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.590
 it's the magic minute range of 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.060
 at loria it's the baby stick is in 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.590
 does it's just a cream bb 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.480
 but stick and that's what is 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.160
 really great so far 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.110
 I had never stopped stick sizes 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.250
 I always had liquid formats and 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.540
 it's true that it's really great 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.890
 I wanted to test and I do not 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.989
 regret at all since I 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.970
 already love the format is just super 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.140
 practice the game lafico must so you 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.030
 see you later in the pictures 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.710
 how do I put it but it does not matter 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.930
 trace is super convenient and partisan 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.550
 brushes and so on is what I love 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.680
 it's the texture that is really great 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.960
 strange but really good it's actually 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.430
 in contact with the skin it's actually going to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.680
 turn into powder format actually 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.359
 really weird at first it's like 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 cream- sized cream like that enough 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.809
 fat if I can say and when you 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.399
 start and go it's going 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.170
 turn into powder and that's really 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.539
 great because the movie is just great 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.090
 natural and that's really the coverage 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.679
 just that it takes my summer why I 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.179
 put down nothing under a false messi 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.500
 but the worried man I like to have 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.570
 really something light but who 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.550
 unites a little bit the redness of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.679
 small imperfections and that's it would be 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.450
 really good job so here's for 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.860
 the application really nothing complicated 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.119
 when I wanted 10 is really hyper 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.560
 simple what I do these people but a 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.240
 little bit everywhere and that I come and to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.770
 is thereafter so I put a 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.060
 just like that on the front 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.619
 we see it's really a format that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.049
 it was great it's pretty fat 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.549
 like that I put three headlines on the 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.860
 cheeks usually three small lines that 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.899
 just a line on the chin and one on 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.729
 the nose so that's what it gives and 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.159
 then I come with my finger and have them 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.899
 teeth with my hands rather spread out and that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.640
 turns into powder format and that 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.719
 spreads super super good I still love 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.430
 girls who have bothered to 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.469
 witches the brushes and that's enough 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.640
 just super good so I'm just telling you 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.159
 no descents in the shot because 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.600
 to avoid demarcations as if I 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.250
 think you see that color me 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.329
 just fits totally it's just 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.329
 the color that I needed 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.730
 then I come to make a slight light 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.040
 make you smile with this powder from 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.590
 avery so it's powder powder 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.120
 all in all and that's the amber feel and I 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.410
 really find this great project for the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.220
 contour in because there is no problem 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.020
 to oranje 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.520
 okani laughed nothing at all so that's 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.739
 really cool to make the con 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.569
 touring and for the brush I use the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.569
 100 bags from zoÃ© share 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 m 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.180
 Oh 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.840
 then for the bluff right now I 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.380
 come out a lot a lot the orgasm of 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.970
 at nars 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.410
 I find it really too much for this 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.420
 season I spring it a little less in 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.830
 winter simply because jacques albo 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.690
 glare shot a little golden 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.850
 directing all that and I find that there is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.320
 really good for the summer and for the faso 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.090
 I do not change at all I use 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.200
 still still the blush brush of 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.820
 louis technique because I find 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.110
 that he really just has the right shape 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.110
 perfect in fact for the cheekbones 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.610
 and finally I use the browser 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.319
 no cheekbones for really 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.670
 reflect the light I love them 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.500
 emitters right now I 'm using 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.540
 a lot the live she pays from china 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.670
 mac is a beautiful creator with 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.230
 full of different pastel colors that 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.689
 are mixed and it really makes a 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.810
 result just too pretty game the fiq is 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.849
 that a little brush like that is the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.019
 the the cfa know i know more what 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.790
 it was I think it's the outline 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.049
 technical rice brush what is 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.430
 normally for the account or ring I 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.609
 find really perfect for the top of the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.609
 cheekbone 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.350
 and 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.430
 and so here it is already round for this 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.870
 road it so how do you see I 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.670
 not fair and enormously produced 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.870
 I really invite to the maximum should be 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.880
 a lot of productions my skin a lot 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.950
 really months makeup layers 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.420
 in the summer when I can not put anything on 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.860
 better but nothing and it does not bother me 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.120
 everything on the other hand if people 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.140
 make up a little bit is really 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.030
 these products that I use 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.650
 I do not put corrector I will not 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.060
 anti dark circles or not for not 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.620
 overload I think I do not have 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.450
 especially need and so suddenly I 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.430
 do not put some just to put some 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.930
 at the moment the bare necessities 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.520
 I hope you will have rained is not 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.200
 if it is the case to put a small thumb 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.150
 to the top and tell me too in the 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.860
 comments what are your products 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.240
 really favorite for the complexion for the summer 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.590
 if you really have a product in 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.970
 particular etc 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.680
 do not hesitate to tell me all this in the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.270
 comments and so here I am you 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.710
 do a lot of the ISO standard and get 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.730
 found again very soon in a new 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.730
 video not the same
