I'll<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.260> what<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:13.770> would<00:00:13.950> call<00:00:14.690> running<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
I'll do what some would call running the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:01:13.580 
I'll do what some would call running the
road<00:00:15.960> condition

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.870 

well<00:01:14.590> we're<00:01:15.159> gonna<00:01:15.280> be<00:01:15.400> planting<00:01:15.640> some

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
well we're gonna be planting some

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.600 
well we're gonna be planting some
mustard<00:01:16.299> green<00:01:16.510> today<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:18.159> some<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.580> the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
mustard green today that's some of the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.780 
mustard green today that's some of the
smallest<00:01:19.119> seeds<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.979> can<00:01:21.190> plant<00:01:21.340> in<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
smallest seeds that you can plant in the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.440 
smallest seeds that you can plant in the
garden<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:25.150> much<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.479> put<00:01:25.630> in<00:01:25.690> well<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.090> black

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
garden how much to put in well the black

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.010 
garden how much to put in well the black
seed<00:01:29.050> plates<00:01:29.409> are<00:01:29.649> shaped<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.100> cups<00:01:30.520> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
seed plates are shaped like cups and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.139 
seed plates are shaped like cups and
that's<00:01:32.020> so<00:01:32.259> it'll<00:01:32.680> hold<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.250> seeds<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:33.970> don't

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
that's so it'll hold the seeds you don't

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.389 
that's so it'll hold the seeds you don't
want<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.360> fill<00:01:34.540> up<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.810> hopper<00:01:35.280> with<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
want to fill up the hopper with the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.070 
want to fill up the hopper with the
small<00:01:36.700> seeds<00:01:37.090> because<00:01:37.420> they<00:01:37.540> might<00:01:37.690> get<00:01:37.899> in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
small seeds because they might get in

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.940 
small seeds because they might get in
between<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.590> plate<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.330> hopper<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
between the plate and the hopper so the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.060 
between the plate and the hopper so the
plate<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.429> designed<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:43.090> hold<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.450> seeds<00:01:44.070> not

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
plate is designed to hold the seeds not

00:01:45.070 --> 00:02:02.070 
plate is designed to hold the seeds not
too<00:01:45.250> hopper<00:01:45.490> oh<00:01:59.640> that's<00:02:00.640> plenty<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.869> don't

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
too hopper oh that's plenty we don't

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.670 
too hopper oh that's plenty we don't
have<00:02:02.200> that<00:02:02.380> far<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.679> go<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:11.140> right<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.290> ready

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
have that far to go all right you ready

00:02:11.680 --> 00:03:10.860 
have that far to go all right you ready
Gus<00:02:12.130> go<00:02:13.120> down<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.569> very<00:02:13.989> center<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.920> rope

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.809 

and<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.500> makes<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.830> easy<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.160> dump<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.580> seeds

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
and it makes it easy to dump the seeds

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:20.250 
and it makes it easy to dump the seeds
out<00:03:13.090> doesn't<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:18.870> remember<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.930> was<00:03:20.080> telling

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
out doesn't it remember I was telling

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.710 
out doesn't it remember I was telling
Carly<00:03:20.950> how<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:21.970> seed<00:03:22.420> plate<00:03:22.780> was<00:03:23.080> designed<00:03:23.890> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
Carly how the seed plate was designed I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.809 
Carly how the seed plate was designed I
want<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.810> show<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:27.959> when<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.019> was<00:03:29.550> trying<00:03:30.550> to

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
want to show you when I was trying to

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:44.190 
want to show you when I was trying to
explain<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.209> her<00:03:42.420> unlike<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.630> other<00:03:43.810> plates

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
explain to her unlike the other plates

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.140 
explain to her unlike the other plates
which<00:03:44.799> are<00:03:44.980> flat<00:03:46.260> plate<00:03:47.260> number<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.790> I

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
which are flat plate number one and I

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.590 
which are flat plate number one and I
think<00:03:49.209> plate<00:03:49.720> number<00:03:50.049> two<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:51.700> shaped<00:03:52.299> like<00:03:52.480> a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
think plate number two is shaped like a

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.259 
think plate number two is shaped like a
cup<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:57.430> know<00:03:57.519> if<00:03:57.610> you<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.880> see<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
cup and I don't know if you can see the

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:06.180 
cup and I don't know if you can see the
small<00:03:58.599> holes<00:04:02.610> but<00:04:03.610> that<00:04:03.880> makes<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.470> ideal<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
small holes but that makes it ideal the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.440 
small holes but that makes it ideal the
plant<00:04:07.049> itty-bitty<00:04:08.049> seeds<00:04:08.910> like<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.060> mustard

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
plant itty-bitty seeds like the mustard

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.199 
plant itty-bitty seeds like the mustard
seed<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:10.870> were<00:04:10.930> planting<00:04:11.230> today<00:04:13.709> when<00:04:15.209> filling

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
seed we were planting today when filling

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.319 
seed we were planting today when filling
your<00:04:16.390> seeds<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:17.579> don't<00:04:18.579> think<00:04:18.820> you'd<00:04:18.970> want<00:04:19.239> to

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
your seeds I don't think you'd want to

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.110 
your seeds I don't think you'd want to
feel<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.840> whole<00:04:20.019> hopper<00:04:20.729> because<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.880> seeds

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
feel the whole hopper because the seeds

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.860 
feel the whole hopper because the seeds
are<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.419> small<00:04:22.780> they<00:04:23.110> may<00:04:24.180> fall<00:04:25.180> between<00:04:25.539> the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
are so small they may fall between the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.840 
are so small they may fall between the
plate<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.500> side<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.130> hopper<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.669> get

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
plate and the side of hopper and get

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.310 
plate and the side of hopper and get
jammed<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.830> would<00:04:29.830> just<00:04:29.860> feel<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:32.050> seed

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
jammed up I would just feel the seed

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.380 
jammed up I would just feel the seed
plate<00:04:32.650> itself<00:04:35.550> well<00:04:36.550> I'm<00:04:36.850> anxious<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.270> see

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
plate itself well I'm anxious to see

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.680 
plate itself well I'm anxious to see
what<00:04:37.600> kind<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.110> stand<00:04:38.410> we're<00:04:38.680> going<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.860> get<00:04:39.690> my

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
what kind of stand we're going to get my

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.850 
what kind of stand we're going to get my
guess<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:41.710> may<00:04:41.950> be<00:04:42.010> a<00:04:42.280> little<00:04:42.610> thick<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:44.680> it

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
guess is it may be a little thick if it

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.930 
guess is it may be a little thick if it
is<00:04:45.389> next<00:04:46.389> time<00:04:46.570> we're<00:04:46.960> going<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.139> stop<00:04:47.500> up

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
is next time we're going to stop up

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.930 
is next time we're going to stop up
maybe<00:04:48.940> every<00:04:49.389> other<00:04:49.419> hole<00:04:49.840> in<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.260> plate<00:04:50.500> and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
maybe every other hole in the plate and

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.980 
maybe every other hole in the plate and
thin<00:04:51.940> that<00:04:52.180> stand<00:04:52.479> out<00:04:52.720> some<00:04:54.840> hope<00:04:55.840> you

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
thin that stand out some hope you

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:09.100 
thin that stand out some hope you
enjoyed<00:04:56.380> hope<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.490> was<00:04:57.639> helpful<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.590> lost<00:04:59.590> bye

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110
