hello everybody on this tutorial let's
meet<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.740> pink<00:00:19.100> bird<00:00:19.279> this<00:00:19.730> is<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:19.940> second

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
meet the pink bird this is a second

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.230 
meet the pink bird this is a second
version<00:00:20.540> of<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.990> blue<00:00:21.290> bird<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.160> first<00:00:22.820> step<00:00:23.060> I

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
version of the blue bird so first step I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:35.040 
version of the blue bird so first step I
fold<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.660> paper<00:00:23.869> in<00:00:24.080> half<00:00:24.290> horizontally<00:00:33.520> and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
fold the paper in half horizontally and

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.770 
fold the paper in half horizontally and
then<00:00:36.050> unfold<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.739> paper<00:00:39.520> naps<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:40.850> start<00:00:41.540> from

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
then unfold the paper naps I start from

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.810 
then unfold the paper naps I start from
this<00:00:42.020> edge<00:00:42.080> for<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:42.950> center<00:00:43.220> crease<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.700> I

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
this edge for to the center crease and I

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.250 
this edge for to the center crease and I
repeat<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.210> same<00:00:44.390> fold<00:00:44.660> for<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.899> opposite

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
repeat the same fold for the opposite

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:57.069 
repeat the same fold for the opposite
side<00:00:54.520> now<00:00:55.520> I<00:00:55.790> start<00:00:56.270> from<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:56.570> edge<00:00:56.780> and

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
side now I start from this edge and

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.720 
side now I start from this edge and
forth<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.590> center<00:00:57.829> crease<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.250> same

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
forth to the center crease and same

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:10.630 
forth to the center crease and same
thing<00:00:58.910> for<00:00:59.090> this<00:00:59.149> side<00:00:59.210> too

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.360 

when<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.030> paper<00:01:12.960> airplanes<00:01:13.770> make<00:01:14.250> sure

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
when you for paper airplanes make sure

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.420 
when you for paper airplanes make sure
that<00:01:14.550> both<00:01:15.150> sides<00:01:15.210> or<00:01:15.870> even<00:01:16.260> if<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that both sides or even if you have a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.240 
that both sides or even if you have a
gap<00:01:17.730> you<00:01:18.630> should<00:01:18.870> leave<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.410> gap<00:01:19.590> even<00:01:20.040> for

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
gap you should leave the gap even for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
gap you should leave the gap even for
both<00:01:20.430> sides<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.390> example<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:22.050> you<00:01:22.260> see<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
both sides for example here you see the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
both sides for example here you see the
gap<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.460> need<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.760> move<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.120> piece<00:01:24.390> of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
gap here so I need to move this piece of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
gap here so I need to move this piece of
paper<00:01:24.660> toward<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> other<00:01:25.830> side<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
paper toward the other side so that this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.370 
paper toward the other side so that this
corner<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.510> this<00:01:27.600> corner<00:01:27.710> are<00:01:28.710> even<00:01:34.369> next<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
corner and this corner are even next I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.440 
corner and this corner are even next I
start<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> tip<00:01:37.830> here<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.190> I'd<00:01:38.399> use<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
start on the tip here and I'd use the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.650 
start on the tip here and I'd use the
intersection<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.759> edge<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
intersection of this this edge here and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.130 
intersection of this this edge here and
this<00:01:42.840> edge<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.580> preference<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.090> fall<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this edge is my preference to fall and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.040 
this edge is my preference to fall and
put<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:46.619> finger<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> fold<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
put my finger here and fold this of the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.410 
put my finger here and fold this of the
paper<00:01:49.259> towel<00:01:49.560> when<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> fold<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.550> I<00:01:50.790> use<00:01:51.119> this

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
paper towel when I fold out I use this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.690 
paper towel when I fold out I use this
crease<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> decrease<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> bottom

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
crease and decrease it from the bottom

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.889 
crease and decrease it from the bottom
you<00:01:53.940> can<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> crease<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.600> bottom

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you can see the crease on the bottom

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:02.679 
you can see the crease on the bottom
here<00:01:55.080> it's<00:01:55.410> my<00:01:55.619> preference<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.310> fall

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.639 

and<00:02:03.969> next<00:02:04.969> step<00:02:05.149> I<00:02:05.539> will<00:02:05.780> start<00:02:06.140> from<00:02:06.319> this

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
and next step I will start from this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.539 
and next step I will start from this
edge<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.219> paper

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
edge of the paper

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.520 
edge of the paper
fold<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.539> center<00:02:08.569> crease<00:02:11.349> repeat<00:02:12.349> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
fold it to the center crease repeat the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.830 
fold it to the center crease repeat the
same<00:02:12.739> fold<00:02:13.010> for<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.280> opposite<00:02:13.610> side

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.500 

this<00:02:20.840> should<00:02:20.989> leave<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.440> gap<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.209> see<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
this should leave a gap you can see the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.330 
this should leave a gap you can see the
gap<00:02:23.660> between<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.170> side<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.739> side<00:02:24.799> this

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
gap between this side and this side this

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.880 
gap between this side and this side this
is<00:02:25.519> really<00:02:25.849> important<00:02:26.269> for<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.840> next<00:02:27.140> step

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
is really important for the next step

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.339 
is really important for the next step
and<00:02:28.790> now<00:02:29.000> at<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:29.360> time<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:29.989> start<00:02:30.260> from

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
and now at this time I would start from

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.619 
and now at this time I would start from
this<00:02:30.530> corner<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:31.280> Australia<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.239> in<00:02:32.360> the

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
this corner of Australia to in the

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.369 
this corner of Australia to in the
intersection<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.349> edge<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.799> this<00:02:33.920> edge

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.520 

and<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> following<00:02:41.599> step<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:42.110> fold<00:02:42.140> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
and on the following step I fold the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:53.149 
and on the following step I fold the
paper<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:42.890> half

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.069 

I'll<00:02:54.159> tell<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.730> paper<00:02:54.939> in<00:02:55.120> half<00:02:55.329> now

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
I'll tell you for the paper in half now

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.170 
I'll tell you for the paper in half now
I'm<00:02:56.290> going<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.620> create<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.920> wings<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.670> will

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
I'm going to create the wings I will

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.449 
I'm going to create the wings I will
match<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.629> corner<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.650> corner<00:02:59.709> to

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
match this corner to this corner to

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:09.750 
match this corner to this corner to
create<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.030> wings<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.069> turn<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.459> paper

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
create the wings and I turn the paper

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.940 
create the wings and I turn the paper
over<00:03:10.139> repeat<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.200> same<00:03:11.409> fold<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.889> side

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
over repeat the same fold for this side

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.550 
over repeat the same fold for this side
match<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.150> edge<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.689> this<00:03:13.989> edge<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:16.560> know

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
match this edge to this edge you know

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.800 
match this edge to this edge you know
the<00:03:17.739> paper<00:03:17.920> now<00:03:18.189> is<00:03:18.340> really<00:03:18.730> hard<00:03:18.939> to<00:03:19.000> fall<00:03:19.299> so

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
the paper now is really hard to fall so

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.559 
the paper now is really hard to fall so
when<00:03:20.349> you<00:03:20.469> fall<00:03:20.709> curve<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.310> down<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.790> forth

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
when you fall curve is down and forth

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:33.289 
when you fall curve is down and forth
slowly<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:27.669> next<00:03:28.569> step<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.900> pull<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.829> wings

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.300 

to<00:03:34.299> meet<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.599> bird<00:03:35.019> fly<00:03:35.349> well<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:36.040> need<00:03:36.219> to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
to meet the bird fly well we need to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.729 
to meet the bird fly well we need to
create<00:03:36.519> these<00:03:36.669> stabilizers<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.959> instead<00:03:38.680> of

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
create these stabilizers so instead of

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.369 
create these stabilizers so instead of
making<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.430> paper<00:03:40.030> up<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:40.450> look<00:03:40.719> like<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.930> real

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
making a paper up and look like a real

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.280 
making a paper up and look like a real
bird<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:42.219> paper<00:03:42.459> airplane<00:03:42.879> is<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.480> fighter

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
bird this paper airplane is a fighter

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.849 
bird this paper airplane is a fighter
or<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.590> bummer<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.310> record<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:46.030> pink<00:03:46.329> bird<00:03:46.859> now

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
or a bummer and record the pink bird now

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.159 
or a bummer and record the pink bird now
I<00:03:47.889> start<00:03:48.489> from<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:48.879> edge<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.450> fold<00:03:49.930> into

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
I start from this edge and fold into

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.559 
I start from this edge and fold into
created<00:03:50.739> stabilizer<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.549> can<00:03:52.030> estimate<00:03:52.239> about

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
created stabilizer I can estimate about

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.599 
created stabilizer I can estimate about
half<00:03:52.930> an<00:03:53.049> inch<00:03:53.200> from<00:03:53.409> this<00:03:53.709> corner<00:03:54.010> around

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
half an inch from this corner around

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.400 
half an inch from this corner around
this<00:03:54.700> edge

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.060 

and<00:03:58.370> now<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.090> pour<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.660> paper<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.230> half<00:04:00.620> like

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
and now I pour the paper in half like

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:10.120 
and now I pour the paper in half like
this<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:02.150> I<00:04:02.180> can<00:04:02.270> fold<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.720> other<00:04:02.810> side<00:04:09.130> after

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
this so I can fold the other side after

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.090 
this so I can fold the other side after
you<00:04:10.250> finish<00:04:10.550> these<00:04:10.760> stabilizers<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.900> can

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
you finish these stabilizers you can

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.680 
you finish these stabilizers you can
fold<00:04:13.100> this<00:04:13.190> stabilizer<00:04:13.700> up<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:14.090> create<00:04:14.450> an

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
fold this stabilizer up to create an

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.949 
fold this stabilizer up to create an
angle<00:04:15.260> of<00:04:15.290> 90<00:04:15.590> degrees<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.670> wings<00:04:17.360> also

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
angle of 90 degrees to the wings also

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.860 
angle of 90 degrees to the wings also
for<00:04:18.230> design<00:04:18.500> after<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.370> finish<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:20.030> pink

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
for design after you finish the pink

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.050 
for design after you finish the pink
bird<00:04:21.170> make<00:04:21.770> sure<00:04:21.920> that<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.160> plan<00:04:22.400> will<00:04:22.610> fly<00:04:22.880> up

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
bird make sure that the plan will fly up

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.210 
bird make sure that the plan will fly up
you<00:04:23.240> need<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.420> create<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.260> elevators<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:25.040> can

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
you need to create the elevators you can

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.040 
you need to create the elevators you can
see<00:04:25.400> how<00:04:25.640> I<00:04:25.670> curved<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.360> end<00:04:26.510> of<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.720> wings<00:04:26.870> up

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
see how I curved the end of the wings up

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.770 
see how I curved the end of the wings up
a<00:04:27.230> bit<00:04:27.380> like<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.940> sometimes<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.360> plane<00:04:29.570> just

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
a bit like this sometimes the plane just

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.330 
a bit like this sometimes the plane just
splash<00:04:30.050> straight<00:04:30.440> down<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.830> this<00:04:31.130> is<00:04:31.190> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
splash straight down and this is the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.270 
splash straight down and this is the
