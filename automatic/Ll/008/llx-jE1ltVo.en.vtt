00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
I can say to take up so I thought I

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.150

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
could fit a full-size upper will not fit

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.810 
could fit a full-size upper will not fit
I<00:02:29.520> mean<00:02:30.480> most<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.280> into<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.580> stagette

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
I mean most of it can go into a stagette

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.170 
I mean most of it can go into a stagette
but<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.680> too<00:02:34.830> long<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.820> won't<00:02:35.850> fit

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
but just a little too long it won't fit

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
but just a little too long it won't fit
all<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> way<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.810> oh<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> merrill<00:02:38.160> city

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
all the way in oh is that a merrill city

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.490 
all the way in oh is that a merrill city
are<00:02:38.460> your<00:02:38.580> journey<00:02:38.760> yes<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.500> that's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
are your journey yes it is that's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.900 
are your journey yes it is that's
ridiculous<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.160> wouldn't<00:02:41.430> be<00:02:41.550> doing<00:02:41.790> this

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
ridiculous you wouldn't be doing this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.230 
ridiculous you wouldn't be doing this
but<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:43.380> could<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:47.100> could<00:02:47.400> possibly<00:02:47.760> hide

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
but you could so you could possibly hide

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.280 
but you could so you could possibly hide
as<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.810> disassembled<00:02:49.550> sbr<00:02:50.550> maybe<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.570> had<00:02:51.870> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
as a disassembled sbr maybe if you had a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.790 
as a disassembled sbr maybe if you had a
pistol<00:02:53.010> AR<00:02:53.520> with<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.180> long<00:02:54.480> folding<00:02:54.959> adapter<00:02:55.440> so

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
pistol AR with a long folding adapter so

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.300 
pistol AR with a long folding adapter so
this<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:56.070> fold<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:57.090> would<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.540> really<00:02:57.690> bulky

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
this was fold it would be really bulky

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.380 
this was fold it would be really bulky
but<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.610> probably<00:02:59.760> fit<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.030> whole<00:03:00.150> thing

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
but you can probably fit the whole thing

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.670 
but you can probably fit the whole thing
is<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.720> Jacqueline<00:03:03.230> 1020<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.380> take

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
is that this Jacqueline 1020 to take

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.610 
is that this Jacqueline 1020 to take
down

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
