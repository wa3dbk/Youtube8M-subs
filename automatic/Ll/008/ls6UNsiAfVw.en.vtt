00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.060 
so when I get to the shore parts of my
hair<00:02:29.420> what<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.200> tried<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.800> do<00:02:31.250> is<00:02:31.720> use<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.070> tip

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
hair what I tried to do is use the tip

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.360 
hair what I tried to do is use the tip
of<00:02:34.280> my<00:02:34.660> straightener<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.990> can<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.440> it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
of my straightener as you can see it's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.730 
of my straightener as you can see it's
pointed<00:02:38.330> so<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:38.600> just<00:02:38.810> try<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.110> use<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> tip

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
pointed so I just try and use the tip

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.790 
pointed so I just try and use the tip
just<00:02:40.490> forget<00:02:40.940> all<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.870> hairs<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.440> it's<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.680> lot

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
just forget all the hairs and it's a lot

00:02:42.800 --> 00:03:18.520 
just forget all the hairs and it's a lot
easier<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.459> use<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.030> tip<00:03:17.049> this<00:03:18.049> would<00:03:18.320> also

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
easier if I use the tip this would also

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.940 
easier if I use the tip this would also
be<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.950> perfect<00:03:19.250> time<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:20.570> apply<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.440> heat

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
be the perfect time to apply a heat

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.949 
be the perfect time to apply a heat
