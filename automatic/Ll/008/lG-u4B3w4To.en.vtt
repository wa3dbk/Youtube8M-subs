people<00:01:56.250> modifying<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.430> bit<00:01:57.640> as<00:01:57.790> well<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.180> you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
people modifying it a bit as well so you

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.670 
people modifying it a bit as well so you
can<00:01:58.390> actually<00:01:58.720> modify<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.440> pretty

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
can actually modify this it's pretty

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.040 
can actually modify this it's pretty
neat<00:01:59.890> what<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.340> can<00:02:00.490> do<00:02:00.580> with<00:02:00.730> this<00:02:01.050> little

neat what you can do with this little

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.870 
neat what you can do with this little
unit<00:02:02.380> but<00:02:02.890> let's<00:02:03.040> open<00:02:03.160> this<00:02:03.340> up<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.700> I'll

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
unit but let's open this up and I'll

unit but let's open this up and I'll
show<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.060> what<00:02:04.210> looks<00:02:04.300> like<00:02:04.420> what<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.960> get

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
show you what looks like what you get

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
show you what looks like what you get
inside<00:02:06.030> okay<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.270> got<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.630> Box<00:02:07.990> open<00:02:08.350> here

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
inside okay so I got the Box open here

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.120 
inside okay so I got the Box open here
let's<00:02:09.700> delve<00:02:10.330> in<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.020> find<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.680> what<00:02:11.830> we<00:02:11.920> get

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
let's delve in and find out what we get

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.420 
let's delve in and find out what we get
okay<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.780> unit<00:02:14.110> itself<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.650> quite<00:02:14.920> big<00:02:15.400> so

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
okay so the unit itself is quite big so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.150 
okay so the unit itself is quite big so
that's<00:02:18.430> what<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.630> here's<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.160> gripper

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
that's what we get so here's the gripper

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.490 
that's what we get so here's the gripper
handle<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.150> there's<00:02:22.360> some<00:02:22.570> some<00:02:22.990> assembly

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
handle so there's some some assembly

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:35.850 
handle so there's some some assembly
required<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:31.209> how<00:02:31.300> big<00:02:31.660> those<00:02:31.780> wheels<00:02:32.050> are<00:02:34.860> so

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
required see how big those wheels are so

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.320 
required see how big those wheels are so
I'm<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.130> open<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.520> get<00:02:37.090> rid<00:02:37.209> of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
I'm going to open this and get rid of
