00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 deserter with you while i was busy so 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 let's say some household chores 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 apple pleased us released ios 8 3 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.389
 let's see bullshit they screwed up there 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.389
 things on 1 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.290
 have noticed that iphone 5s is gold 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 watch video on the channel like me 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.940
 bought this course bumper and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 what else did you want to tell me 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.350
 public profile is set 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 testing rsb the software profile 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.860
 I would not delete to install 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 then I think that at first 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.050
 put and then it will be possible 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.660
 remove 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.270
 but let's go back and see bullshit they 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.520
 here it weighs 1 and 3 gigabytes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.559
 And this dofiga because in language or 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 fight to read this list in short 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 what I want to say they did Russian 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579
 series judging by the rumors of people who are already 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.920
 updated they say that 's the way 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.620
 here is the whole article in which languages 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.450
 became available siri me remained the same 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.800
 moronic synth voice on rather 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.869
 all this will correct in future updates 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.690
 but now she is officially 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.240
 in Russian can be with you 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.090
 and try to answer your stupid jokes 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 added means filtering the message this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 It was still in the penultimate beta when 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 unknown contacts write there for example 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.970
 imessage or other sms they refer 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.039
 here and not much bother you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.390
 notifications 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.250
 I didn't read a lot of things 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.039

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.440
 Bluetooth and corrected phones and text messages
