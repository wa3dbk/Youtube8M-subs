00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
first thing to talk about here is a try

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.010 
first thing to talk about here is a try
logic<00:00:15.320> bass<00:00:15.950> pre<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:16.640> it's<00:00:17.300> basically<00:00:17.690> what's

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
logic bass pre and it's basically what's

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.170 
logic bass pre and it's basically what's
in<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.290> space<00:00:18.530> right<00:00:18.830> now<00:00:19.040> but<00:00:19.760> what<00:00:19.910> I<00:00:19.940> wanted

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
in the space right now but what I wanted

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.150 
in the space right now but what I wanted
I'm<00:00:20.420> gonna<00:00:20.539> show<00:00:20.750> you<00:00:20.810> what<00:00:21.289> you<00:00:21.410> do<00:00:21.710> with<00:00:22.100> a

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
I'm gonna show you what you do with a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.070 
I'm gonna show you what you do with a
passive<00:00:22.580> bass<00:00:22.760> I'm<00:00:23.000> going<00:00:23.120> to<00:00:23.180> put<00:00:23.750> this<00:00:23.840> bass

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
passive bass I'm going to put this bass

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.300 
passive bass I'm going to put this bass
on<00:00:24.260> passive<00:00:26.170> now<00:00:27.170> here's<00:00:27.440> a<00:00:27.680> couple<00:00:28.010> things<00:00:28.130> to

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
on passive now here's a couple things to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.120 
on passive now here's a couple things to
think<00:00:28.340> about<00:00:28.520> when<00:00:28.789> you<00:00:28.850> have<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.000> passive<00:00:29.390> bass

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
think about when you have a passive bass

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.740 
think about when you have a passive bass
passive<00:00:31.130> bass<00:00:31.250> has<00:00:31.490> very<00:00:31.760> little<00:00:31.940> output<00:00:32.390> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
passive bass has very little output and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.099 
passive bass has very little output and
in<00:00:33.710> some<00:00:34.010> venues<00:00:34.510> when<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.600> go<00:00:35.719> all<00:00:35.839> over<00:00:35.870> the

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
in some venues when you go all over the

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.529 
in some venues when you go all over the
world<00:00:36.319> if<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.640> know<00:00:37.789> they<00:00:37.969> have<00:00:38.089> a<00:00:38.120> passive

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
world if you know they have a passive

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.989 
world if you know they have a passive
direct<00:00:38.839> box<00:00:39.019> as<00:00:39.199> well<00:00:39.409> and<00:00:39.979> you<00:00:40.819> know<00:00:40.850> after

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:40.999 
direct box as well and you know after

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:42.279 
direct box as well and you know after
like<00:00:41.239> three<00:00:41.420> hundred<00:00:41.479> yards<00:00:41.870> it's<00:00:42.019> hard<00:00:42.199> to

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
like three hundred yards it's hard to

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:43.869 
like three hundred yards it's hard to
drive<00:00:42.499> the<00:00:42.710> line<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.399> board<00:00:43.609> in<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:43.850> back

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
drive the line to the board in the back

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.119 
drive the line to the board in the back
so<00:00:44.569> it's<00:00:44.690> good<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.899> have<00:00:45.109> some<00:00:45.409> sort<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.710> preamp

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
so it's good to have some sort of preamp

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.879 
so it's good to have some sort of preamp
to<00:00:46.969> help<00:00:47.179> you<00:00:47.300> do<00:00:47.449> that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:47.889 
to help you do that

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:50.290 
to help you do that
and<00:00:48.889> believe<00:00:49.309> me<00:00:49.460> I've<00:00:49.699> spent<00:00:49.819> some<00:00:50.179> of<00:00:50.210> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
and believe me I've spent some of the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.209 
and believe me I've spent some of the
best<00:00:50.510> studios<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:50.929> the<00:00:50.960> world<00:00:51.019> and<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:52.039> REC

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
best studios in the world and the REC

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.439 
best studios in the world and the REC
box<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.609> usually<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:52.940> last<00:00:53.089> thing<00:00:53.210> they<00:00:53.389> think

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
box is usually the last thing they think

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.180 
box is usually the last thing they think
about<00:00:53.659> so<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.499> good<00:00:54.679> to<00:00:54.710> have<00:00:54.920> something

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
about so it's good to have something

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.489 
about so it's good to have something
like<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.699> in<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.179> studio<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:56.839> live<00:00:57.229> you

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
like this in the studio and live you

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.259 
like this in the studio and live you
know<00:00:57.589> it's<00:00:57.679> fantastic<00:00:58.249> especially<00:00:58.729> if<00:00:59.209> you

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
know it's fantastic especially if you

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.750 
know it's fantastic especially if you
have<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.389> passive<00:00:59.780> bass<00:00:59.929> let<00:01:00.799> me<00:01:00.979> give<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:01.699> an

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
have a passive bass let me give you an

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.729 
have a passive bass let me give you an
example<00:01:02.030> here<00:01:02.269> what<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:02.629> actually<00:01:02.780> does<00:01:03.079> mmm

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
example here what it actually does mmm

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.560 
example here what it actually does mmm
there's<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.460> switch<00:01:04.760> here<00:01:04.940> for<00:01:05.089> passive<00:01:05.449> and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
there's a switch here for passive and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.289 
there's a switch here for passive and
active<00:01:05.829> in<00:01:06.829> this<00:01:06.950> case<00:01:07.219> I'm<00:01:07.490> pretending<00:01:08.149> that

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
active in this case I'm pretending that

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.780 
active in this case I'm pretending that
I'm<00:01:08.420> playing<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.659> passive<00:01:09.020> name<00:01:11.049> volume

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
I'm playing a passive name volume

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.700 
I'm playing a passive name volume
and<00:01:14.390> now<00:01:14.510> here's<00:01:14.720> his<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.320> interesting

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
and now here's his the interesting

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.200 
and now here's his the interesting
things<00:01:15.920> now<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.310> very<00:01:16.370> good<00:01:16.820> tone

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
things now you have a very good tone

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.280 
things now you have a very good tone
circuit<00:01:17.690> here<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.680> low<00:01:18.860> frequency<00:01:23.140> now<00:01:24.140> I'd

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
circuit here the low frequency now I'd

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.400 
circuit here the low frequency now I'd
like<00:01:24.410> to<00:01:24.470> use<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:24.920> actually<00:01:25.520> sometimes

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
like to use this actually sometimes

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.390 
like to use this actually sometimes
depending<00:01:27.410> on<00:01:27.530> where<00:01:27.680> you're<00:01:27.830> playing<00:01:28.040> and

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
depending on where you're playing and

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.800 
depending on where you're playing and
let's<00:01:28.910> say<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.090> have<00:01:29.210> an<00:01:29.300> amp<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.510> doesn't

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
let's say you have an amp that doesn't

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.260 
let's say you have an amp that doesn't
have<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:29.930> lot<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.290> volume<00:01:30.470> if<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.460> cut<00:01:31.760> the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
have a lot of volume if you cut the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.700 
have a lot of volume if you cut the
glows<00:01:32.540> actually<00:01:33.260> you<00:01:33.320> get<00:01:33.410> a<00:01:33.470> lot<00:01:33.680> more

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
glows actually you get a lot more

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.100 
glows actually you get a lot more
Headroom<00:01:34.610> out<00:01:34.730> of<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.910> power<00:01:35.090> amp<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:35.960> that's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
Headroom out of the power amp so that's

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.810 
Headroom out of the power amp so that's
a<00:01:36.230> good<00:01:36.380> thing<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.710> use<00:01:36.740> also<00:01:37.160> it's<00:01:37.400> not<00:01:37.490> always

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
a good thing to use also it's not always

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.600 
a good thing to use also it's not always
adding<00:01:38.240> sometimes<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.690> want<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.840> subtract

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
adding sometimes you want to subtract

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.140 
adding sometimes you want to subtract
but<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:40.790> is<00:01:40.940> probably<00:01:41.360> around<00:01:43.150> anywhere

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
but this is probably around anywhere

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.660 
but this is probably around anywhere
from<00:01:44.390> 20<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.780> 40<00:01:45.020> Hertz<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:46.190> way<00:01:46.400> down<00:01:46.610> there

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
from 20 to 40 Hertz it's way down there

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.190 
from 20 to 40 Hertz it's way down there
so<00:01:47.060> this<00:01:47.120> is<00:01:47.210> like<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> stuff<00:01:47.780> you're<00:01:47.930> feeling

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
so this is like the stuff you're feeling

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.260 
so this is like the stuff you're feeling
you're<00:01:48.490> you<00:01:49.490> know<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.700> stuff<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.000> feel<00:01:50.150> in

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
you're you know the stuff you feel in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.660 
you're you know the stuff you feel in
your<00:01:50.300> chest<00:01:50.420> it's<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:50.930> great<00:01:51.170> your<00:01:52.010> perfect<00:01:52.580> low

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
your chest it's a great your perfect low

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.810 
your chest it's a great your perfect low
in<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.360> mid<00:01:53.600> switch<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.160> high<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.640> low

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
in the mid switch here is high and low

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:06.730 
in the mid switch here is high and low
I'll<00:01:56.690> let<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.320> hear<00:01:57.470> both<00:02:04.479> it's<00:02:05.479> probably<00:02:05.990> two

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
I'll let you hear both it's probably two

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.029 
I'll let you hear both it's probably two
and<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> half<00:02:07.070> K<00:02:07.460> 3<00:02:08.149> K<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.510> the<00:02:08.600> high

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
and a half K 3 K on the high

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.890 
and a half K 3 K on the high
and<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.000> low<00:02:12.549> let's<00:02:13.549> say<00:02:13.700> that's<00:02:13.909> for<00:02:14.180> 500

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and the low let's say that's for 500

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.770 
and the low let's say that's for 500
this<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.799> which<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.040> great<00:02:16.340> that's<00:02:16.970> exactly

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
this is which is great that's exactly

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.750 
this is which is great that's exactly
the<00:02:17.870> way<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.950> know<00:02:19.069> that's<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> way<00:02:19.489> if

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
the way you know that's the way if

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.890 
the way you know that's the way if
you're<00:02:19.909> doing<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> lot<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.239> harmonics<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
you're doing a lot of harmonics and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.020 
you're doing a lot of harmonics and
stuff<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.560> I'll<00:02:22.280> give<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.489> an<00:02:22.549> example

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
stuff like that I'll give you an example

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.470 
stuff like that I'll give you an example
put<00:02:23.360> back<00:02:23.540> back<00:02:23.750> up

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.300 

now<00:02:31.959> remember<00:02:32.260> this<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.410> completely<00:02:32.920> passive

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
now remember this is completely passive

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.309 
now remember this is completely passive
acts<00:02:33.520> here<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:34.030> know<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.300> using<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.989> passive

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
acts here you know I'm using in passive

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.740 
acts here you know I'm using in passive
mode<00:02:36.959> see<00:02:37.959> if<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.110> cut<00:02:38.290> all<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> mids<00:02:39.750> doesn't

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
mode see if I cut all the mids doesn't

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.199 
mode see if I cut all the mids doesn't
want<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.930> come<00:02:41.080> out<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.250> 400<00:02:42.910> really

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
want to come out so that that 400 really

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.720 
want to come out so that that 400 really
brings<00:02:43.450> out<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.660> mids<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.530> a<00:02:45.040> really<00:02:45.340> good<00:02:45.519> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
brings out the mids and a really good I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.690 
brings out the mids and a really good I
mean<00:02:45.879> excuse<00:02:46.599> me<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.930> 400<00:02:47.560> mids<00:02:47.800> for<00:02:48.340> hundreds

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
mean excuse me the 400 mids for hundreds

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:58.090 
mean excuse me the 400 mids for hundreds
brings<00:02:49.510> out<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.720> harmonics<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.319> your<00:02:50.470> bass

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.480 

so<00:02:59.100> it's<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.580> great<00:03:00.560> frequency<00:03:01.560> you

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
so it's a really great frequency you

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.370 
so it's a really great frequency you
know<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.820> very<00:03:02.880> usable<00:03:03.180> frequency<00:03:03.870> now

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
know it's a very usable frequency now

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.610 
know it's a very usable frequency now
the<00:03:04.440> 3k<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.350> good

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the 3k on that is really like a good

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.510 
the 3k on that is really like a good
finger<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:10.280> lot<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.130> high<00:03:14.280> end

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
finger a lot of you get the high end

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.150 
finger a lot of you get the high end
that<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.760> need<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.270> mean<00:03:15.870> 3k<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
that you need I mean 3k is you know a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.120 
that you need I mean 3k is you know a
very<00:03:17.790> high<00:03:17.910> mid<00:03:18.300> sound<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:18.840> that's<00:03:19.709> very

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
very high mid sound so that's very

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.370 
very high mid sound so that's very
useful<00:03:20.640> if<00:03:21.480> your<00:03:21.630> strings<00:03:21.870> are<00:03:21.990> dead<00:03:22.200> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
useful if your strings are dead that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.510 
useful if your strings are dead that
sort<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.680> thing<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:22.950> really<00:03:23.130> brings<00:03:23.370> out

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
sort of thing it really brings out

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.250 
sort of thing it really brings out
everything<00:03:23.970> now<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> high<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.380> this

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.869 

yeah<00:03:29.769> I'm<00:03:29.860> not<00:03:29.980> an<00:03:30.099> expert<00:03:30.310> here<00:03:30.580> but<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.730> would

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
yeah I'm not an expert here but I would

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.790 
yeah I'm not an expert here but I would
think<00:03:31.120> that's<00:03:31.750> probably

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.150 

it<00:03:35.490> sounds<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.180> shelving<00:03:37.020> EQ<00:03:37.160> probably

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
it sounds like a shelving EQ probably

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.559 
it sounds like a shelving EQ probably
eight<00:03:38.400> or<00:03:38.670> nine<00:03:39.209> K<00:03:40.730> I'm<00:03:41.730> probably<00:03:42.000> wrong<00:03:42.209> but

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
eight or nine K I'm probably wrong but

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.170 
eight or nine K I'm probably wrong but
I'm<00:03:42.780> guessing<00:03:43.069> but<00:03:44.069> what's<00:03:44.670> great<00:03:44.849> about<00:03:44.970> that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
I'm guessing but what's great about that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.660 
I'm guessing but what's great about that
is<00:03:45.420> if<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.900> have<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.080> bass<00:03:49.250> by<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.489> have

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
is if you have a bass by the way I have

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.809 
is if you have a bass by the way I have
this<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:52.100> call<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.190> The<00:03:53.340> Music<00:03:53.790> Man

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
this in the I call it The Music Man

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.650 
this in the I call it The Music Man
sound<00:03:54.300> on<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.540> pickups<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.940> know<00:03:57.060> if<00:03:57.510> you

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
sound on the pickups so you know if you

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.680 
sound on the pickups so you know if you
put<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.530> take<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.800> highs<00:03:58.950> off

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
put if you take the highs off

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.180 
put if you take the highs off
now<00:04:00.690> here's<00:04:00.900> using<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> high<00:04:01.530> EQ<00:04:04.069> that's<00:04:05.069> a

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
now here's using the high EQ that's a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.220 
now here's using the high EQ that's a
lot<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.550> know<00:04:05.640> of<00:04:05.730> course<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.090> vary<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.840> but

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
lot you know of course you vary it but

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.160 
lot you know of course you vary it but
that's<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.560> UM<00:04:10.700> that's<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.880> very<00:04:12.239> snappy<00:04:12.660> sort

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
that's the UM that's a very snappy sort

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.289 
that's the UM that's a very snappy sort
of<00:04:13.260> sound<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.310> get<00:04:14.430> out<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.700> horns<00:04:15.030> if

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
of sound that you get out of horns if

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.640 
of sound that you get out of horns if
you're<00:04:15.510> running<00:04:15.660> your<00:04:15.900> rig<00:04:16.049> through<00:04:16.290> horns

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
you're running your rig through horns

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.849 
you're running your rig through horns
you're<00:04:16.979> going<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.160> want<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:18.260> frequency<00:04:19.260> it's

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
you're going to want this frequency it's

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.110 
you're going to want this frequency it's
a<00:04:19.919> great<00:04:20.160> frequency<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.700> have<00:04:20.850> these<00:04:21.000> are

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
a great frequency to have these are

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.700 
a great frequency to have these are
basically<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.570> most<00:04:21.810> usable<00:04:22.139> frequencies

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
basically the most usable frequencies
