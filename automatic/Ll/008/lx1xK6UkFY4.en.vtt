00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.279
 how to imagine then the effect that an asteroid of 500 could have 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 kilometers in diameter colliding with the earth 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.740
 This reconstruction has been carried out under the control of experts in 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.739
 geophysics 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.920
 to facilitate the understanding of the proportions the land has been 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920
 represented as we know it today 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.980
 an asteroid 500 kilometers in diameter is for example larger than 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 any of the islands that make up Japan 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.570
 the point of impact that was located in the Pacific Ocean between Japan 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.570
 and australia 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.180
 the speed of the asteroid is 72 thousand kilometers per hour zero as it is huge 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 everything seems to develop in slow motion 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.900
 by the effect of the impact the earth's crust of a ten kilometers 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.439
 of thickness takes off from the mantle 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.080
 producing what is known as a crash sun amy 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.140
 a tsunami of the earth's crust 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.910
 the thin white film is the four thousand meters of depth of the ocean 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.920
 the archipelago of japan is automatically pulverized 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.239
 gigantic pieces are projected beyond the atmosphere to several thousand 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.139
 kilometers of the surface before falling back to earth 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
 producing the effect of large power pumps 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.249
 the lips of the crater form an immense chain of mountains of seven thousand 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.249
 meters high 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:49.559
 the crater itself is a gulf four thousand kilometers in diameter 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.819
 and this is no more than the first moments of the catastrophe 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:00.909
 in my huge list incandescent dome that remains on the 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.520
 crater for a few moments after the impact 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.520
 it's the rock vapor 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.369
 one hundred billion megatone is rock instantly transformed into steam 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.369
 by the extreme heat generated by the collision 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.629
 after inflating forming a dome we are either steam rock and hurry 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.629
 it expands at great speed in all directions 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.090
 just three hours after the impact on the ocean an extraordinary burst 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.599
 of rock vapor with four thousand degrees centigrade temperature and 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.889
 moving at a speed of 300 meters per second 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.889
 reaches the himalayas 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:22.479
 the rock vapor now reaches the Amazon at the antipodes of the place 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.479
 where the impact occurred 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.930
 the intensity of the heat produces a phenomenon of spontaneous combustion 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.680
 In the blink of an eye the June becomes an Indian Ocean 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.979
 twenty-four hours after the impact the entire planet is covered in a 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.979
 high temperature rock vapor cloud 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.110
 this cloud will cover the globe for about a year 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:21.099
 the ocean 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.099
 origin of life does not escape catastrophe 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.499
 while the rock vapor ends up wrapping the earth 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.499
 the marine surface gurgles everywhere 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.669
 comes to a boil 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.270
 the violence of evaporation lowers the water level a rhythm 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.270
 unimaginable five centimeters per minute 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.430
 the water of the sea disappears completely 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.839
 only health remains 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.839
 but it also evaporates quickly 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.279
 the ocean floor is now bare and continues to be subjected to that 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.199
 extreme temperature 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.199
 very quickly begins to melt 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.989
 only one month after the impact this is the aspect that the 

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.989
 earth under his rock steam shroud 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:52.260
 a single collision with an asteroid 500 kilometers in diameter 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
 and it does not have a single drop of water on the entire planet 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.490
 When that event took place, it was eradicated. It took the form of life from 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.999
 the surface of the globe 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:08.159
 and yet 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:11.159
 We are here 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:24.330
 but after a year the rock vapor dissipated 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
 and the temperature began to decrease progressively 

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.710
 two thousand years later the water evaporated from the oceans finally returned to 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.900
 condensed in the form of rains and fell on the earth a rhythm of 3 thousand 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.900
 millimeters per year 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.550
 These precipitations are as torrential as those of our zones 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.510
 tropical 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.510
 they were the food of the oceanic vessels 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.599
 in that precise moment 

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.649
 far below the ocean floor numerous microorganisms were still surviving and 

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:07.520
 among them our first ancestors
