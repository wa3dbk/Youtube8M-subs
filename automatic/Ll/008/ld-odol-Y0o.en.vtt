much difficulty and very little success

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.630 
much difficulty and very little success
and<00:00:19.619> thought<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> whole<00:00:20.580> lot

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
better so we start from scratch here in

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.180 
better so we start from scratch here in
California<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:25.380> fact<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.710> much<00:00:26.010> better

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190
