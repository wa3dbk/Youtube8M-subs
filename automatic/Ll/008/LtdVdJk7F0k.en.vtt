00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
can see this guy basic steam shovel this

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.660 
can see this guy basic steam shovel this
swivels<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:55.140> goes<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> down<00:00:55.890> bucket

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
swivels this goes up and down bucket

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.720 
swivels this goes up and down bucket
scoob's<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.290> how<00:00:58.470> good<00:00:58.740> flexibility<00:00:59.430> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
scoob's you know how good flexibility so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
scoob's you know how good flexibility so
it's<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:00.360> playability<00:01:00.720> if<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.470> would<00:01:01.620> let<00:01:01.710> any

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it's good playability if I would let any

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's good playability if I would let any
for<00:01:02.190> my<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.640> cousins<00:01:02.970> play<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.330> these

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
for my little cousins play with these

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.849 
for my little cousins play with these
toys<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:03.990> don't<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.530> behind<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:04.859 
toys but I don't they're behind a

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.830 
toys but I don't they're behind a
display<00:01:05.189> case<00:01:05.429> but<00:01:06.240> anyway<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.929> never<00:01:07.020> know

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
display case but anyway you never know

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.870 
display case but anyway you never know
so<00:01:09.840> basically<00:01:10.649> transformation<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.579> I<00:01:11.609> said

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
so basically transformation as I said

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
so basically transformation as I said
same<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.210> bone<00:01:12.390> crusher<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.439> first<00:01:13.649> thing

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
same as bone crusher so the first thing

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.160 
same as bone crusher so the first thing
you<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.219> do<00:01:14.429> is<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:15.509> him<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.049> this

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you want to do is get him out of this

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.609 
you want to do is get him out of this
yoga<00:01:16.619> position<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.369> take<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.819> treads<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.619> and

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
yoga position or take the treads out and

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.779 
yoga position or take the treads out and
he's<00:01:19.799> kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.159> folded<00:01:20.399> back<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.670> himself

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
he's kind of folded back at himself

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.550 
he's kind of folded back at himself
different<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.539> bone<00:01:21.719> crusher<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
different than bone crusher you have to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
different than bone crusher you have to
fold<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> feet<00:01:23.869> out<00:01:25.009> okay<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.819> you<00:01:26.909> want<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
fold the feet out okay so you want to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.379 
fold the feet out okay so you want to
turn<00:01:27.600> both<00:01:28.350> legs<00:01:28.679> down<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.700> digger<00:01:29.939> bucket

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:30.389 
turn both legs down the digger bucket

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:35.450 
turn both legs down the digger bucket
can<00:01:31.079> act<00:01:31.319> as<00:01:31.819> a<00:01:33.649> balance<00:01:34.649> so<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.189> put<00:01:35.310> him

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
can act as a balance so you can put him

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.599 
can act as a balance so you can put him
in<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:37.039> spread<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.130> legs<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.399> however

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
in the back spread the legs out however

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.699 
in the back spread the legs out however
you<00:01:38.789> like<00:01:39.889> pop<00:01:40.889> these<00:01:41.869> side<00:01:42.869> panels<00:01:43.109> out<00:01:43.409> which

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
you like pop these side panels out which

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.499 
you like pop these side panels out which
become<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> arms<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:44.909> similar<00:01:45.209> to<00:01:45.270> bone

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
become the arms very similar to bone

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.580 
become the arms very similar to bone
crusher<00:01:45.869> they're<00:01:46.170> shaped<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> little

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
crusher they're shaped a little

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.349 
crusher they're shaped a little
differently<00:01:46.709> move<00:01:47.609> them<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.880> however<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
differently move them in however you
