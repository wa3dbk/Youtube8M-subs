let's talk about the game a little bit

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.330 
let's talk about the game a little bit
so<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.860> running<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.960> predator<00:00:51.960> missile<00:00:52.340> I'm

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
so I'm running a predator missile I'm

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.610 
so I'm running a predator missile I'm
not<00:00:53.579> at<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> copper<00:00:54.180> predator<00:00:54.629> missle<00:00:54.930> Reaper

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
not at a copper predator missle Reaper

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
not at a copper predator missle Reaper
and<00:00:55.649> then<00:00:55.949> um<00:00:56.280> pave<00:00:56.940> low<00:00:57.149> usually<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.989> run<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and then um pave low usually I run at a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
and then um pave low usually I run at a
copter<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.219> time<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.460> decided<00:00:59.699> ma'am<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
copter but this time and decided ma'am I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
copter but this time and decided ma'am I
might<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.020> well<00:01:01.140> try<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> run<00:01:01.649> pave<00:01:02.609> low

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
might as well try to run pave low

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
might as well try to run pave low
instead<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.570> might<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.260> copter<00:01:04.589> was

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
instead because might a copter was

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.920 
instead because might a copter was
getting<00:01:04.890> shot<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.549> too<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
getting shot down like too much and I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I knew they were spawning behind there

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.569 
I knew they were spawning behind there
so<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:37.590> gonna<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:38.130> ahead<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so I'm gonna go ahead and use this

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.399 
so I'm gonna go ahead and use this
chalice<00:01:38.909> body<00:01:39.119> could<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> red<00:01:39.780> dots

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
chalice body could see on the red dots

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.960 
chalice body could see on the red dots
that<00:01:40.829> their<00:01:41.009> head<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.280> there's<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.640> couple<00:01:41.790> of

gold<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.899> opinion<00:01:52.170> looks<00:01:52.649> cool<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
gold in my opinion looks cool it's a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.510 
gold in my opinion looks cool it's a
it's<00:01:54.210> fun<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.079> also<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it's fun to have I also have the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's fun to have I also have the
contrast<00:01:56.909> up<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.329> gameplay<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
contrast up on this gameplay so if it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.069 
contrast up on this gameplay so if it
looks<00:01:58.439> brighter<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.610> gold<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.210> than

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
looks brighter and more gold in a than

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.810 
looks brighter and more gold in a than
normal<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> contrast<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.460> up<00:02:02.610> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
normal it's because the contrast is up a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
normal it's because the contrast is up a
little<00:02:03.270> bit<00:02:03.360> higher<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.750> leave<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> print

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
little bit higher and leave this print

from<00:02:14.970> modern<00:02:15.180> warfare<00:02:15.330> two<00:02:16.610> other<00:02:17.610> than<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
from modern warfare two other than the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
from modern warfare two other than the
look<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.300> field<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.840> mean<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.440> sort<00:02:19.650> of

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
look in the field I mean it sort of

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.530 
look in the field I mean it sort of
feels<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.420> was

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
feels like it but it's like I was

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.060 
feels like it but it's like I was
mentioned<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:21.960> previous<00:02:22.230> review<00:02:22.800> video

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
mentioned in my previous review video

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.410 
mentioned in my previous review video
it's<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.970> uh<00:02:24.860> looks<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.070> feels<00:02:26.460> sort<00:02:27.330> of

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's like uh looks and feels sort of

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.840 
it's like uh looks and feels sort of
similar<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.080> not<00:02:28.290> looking<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.280> two

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
similar but it's not looking this two

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.240 
similar but it's not looking this two
piece<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:30.300> here<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.870> end<00:02:31.020> up

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
piece right here and then I end up

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.620 
piece right here and then I end up
trying<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.640> last<00:02:32.820> guy<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
trying to get that last guy with with a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.420 
trying to get that last guy with with a
standard<00:02:34.050> bag<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.860> some<00:02:35.040> reason<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.400> just

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
standard bag and for some reason I just

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.650 
standard bag and for some reason I just
didn't<00:02:35.850> end<00:02:35.940> up<00:02:36.060> pulling<00:02:36.210> it<00:02:36.390> off<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.600> time

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
didn't end up pulling it off this time

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.440 
didn't end up pulling it off this time
so<00:02:37.340> what<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.490> do<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.180> would<00:02:39.300> have<00:02:39.390> been

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
so what can you do it would have been

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.640 
so what can you do it would have been
nice<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.630> live<00:02:40.020> through<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.530> would

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
nice to live through this and I would

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.870 
nice to live through this and I would
have<00:02:40.740> gotten<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.980> pavelow<00:02:41.160> earlier<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.790> then

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
have gotten a pavelow earlier and then

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.970 
have gotten a pavelow earlier and then
who<00:02:42.030> knows<00:02:42.060> what<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.510> work<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.870> ban<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.950> uh

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
who knows what this work to ban but uh

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.590 
who knows what this work to ban but uh
but<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.580> ended<00:02:44.820> up<00:02:44.880> getting<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> Reaper<00:02:45.420> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
but I ended up getting the Reaper and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.440 
but I ended up getting the Reaper and
the<00:02:46.500> Reaper<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.830> probably<00:02:47.310> honestly<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.270> best

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the Reaper is probably honestly the best

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.450 
the Reaper is probably honestly the best
kill<00:02:48.750> streak<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.170> game<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:50.010> mean<00:02:50.310> kill

streak in the attack category um it has

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.610 
streak in the attack category um it has
to<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.390> best<00:02:54.570> killstreak<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.380> mean<00:02:55.500> it's

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
myself doesn't happen too often but i

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.650 
myself doesn't happen too often but i
gotta<00:03:41.310> say<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.550> feels<00:03:41.580> pretty<00:03:41.970> good<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.240> get<00:03:42.600> a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
gotta say it feels pretty good to get a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.360 
gotta say it feels pretty good to get a
multiple<00:03:43.620> kills<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:43.950> i<00:03:43.980> think<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.220> was<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370

multiple kills and i think that was the
last<00:03:44.580> time<00:03:44.760> i<00:03:44.850> ended<00:03:45.120> up<00:03:45.150> dying<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> game

and i was trying to shoot down that
Reaper<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> shooting<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> second<00:03:49.170> one<00:03:49.290> up

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
