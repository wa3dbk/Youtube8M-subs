was<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> kid<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.259> discussion

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
was a kid there was a lot of discussion

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.700 
was a kid there was a lot of discussion
around<00:01:37.979> movies<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.270> went<00:01:39.509> curtains<00:01:40.380> opened

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
around movies you went curtains opened

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
around movies you went curtains opened
up<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.340> went<00:01:41.549> somewhere<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.209> kind

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
up and you went somewhere and you kind

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
up and you went somewhere and you kind
of<00:01:42.450> had<00:01:42.569> no<00:01:42.780> idea<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.289> you<00:01:43.439> were<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.590> many

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of had no idea where you were going many

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.919 
of had no idea where you were going many
people<00:01:44.490> talk<00:01:44.880> about<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.209> they<00:01:45.420> love<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
people talk about it they love them to

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.230 
people talk about it they love them to
death<00:01:45.959> they<00:01:46.350> love<00:01:46.500> movies<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> death<00:01:47.149> you<00:01:48.149> know

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
death they love movies to death you know

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.580 
death they love movies to death you know
and<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.959> too<00:01:49.020> much<00:01:49.170> about<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and so you know way too much about it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.559 
and so you know way too much about it
before<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.039> good<00:01:50.340> before<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.850> set<00:01:51.270> foot<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.509> a

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
before you good before you set foot in a

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.880 
before you good before you set foot in a
theater<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.259> now<00:01:53.360> obviously<00:01:54.360> there's<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.959> 3d

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
theater right now obviously there's a 3d

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190 
theater right now obviously there's a 3d
extravaganza<00:01:56.849> how<00:01:57.239> would<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.509> compare<00:01:57.720> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
extravaganza how would you compare I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.580 
extravaganza how would you compare I
guess<00:01:59.039> this<00:01:59.340> new<00:01:59.640> stereo<00:02:00.060> topic<00:02:00.590> stereoscopic

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
guess this new stereo topic stereoscopic

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.279 
guess this new stereo topic stereoscopic
technology<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.090> 3d<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.959> you've<00:02:04.079> seen<00:02:04.229> in

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
technology to the 3d that you've seen in

technology to the 3d that you've seen in
the<00:02:04.409> past<00:02:04.649> what's<00:02:04.979> what's<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> biggest

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
the past what's what's the biggest

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.760 
the past what's what's the biggest
difference<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.869> think<00:02:07.560> we're<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.739> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
difference for you I think we're in a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
difference for you I think we're in a
whole<00:02:07.890> new<00:02:08.039> world<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.399> 3d<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
whole new world of 3d I know it's it I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
whole new world of 3d I know it's it I
used<00:02:10.019> to<00:02:10.079> call<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.289> 3g<00:02:10.590> Renaissance<00:02:11.130> but

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
used to call it the 3g Renaissance but

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.710 
used to call it the 3g Renaissance but
that<00:02:11.790> sort<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.090> almost<00:02:12.299> gives<00:02:12.540> too<00:02:12.690> much

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
that sort of almost gives too much

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680 
that sort of almost gives too much
credit<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.200> them<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.239> original<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.450> sauce

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
you know in nineteen fifty-two 52 and 53

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.009 
you know in nineteen fifty-two 52 and 53
you<00:02:19.739> had<00:02:19.860> 25<00:02:20.370> movies<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.910> 18<00:02:21.239> months<00:02:21.450> came<00:02:21.870> out

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
you had 25 movies in 18 months came out

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.500 
you had 25 movies in 18 months came out
3d<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.590> then<00:02:22.709> nothing<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.310> 20<00:02:24.060> years<00:02:24.269> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
3d and then nothing for 20 years and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.270 
3d and then nothing for 20 years and
there<00:02:24.840> was<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> reason<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.470> everybody

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
there was a reason for that everybody

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.740 
there was a reason for that everybody
jumped<00:02:26.549> on<00:02:26.639> a<00:02:26.670> bandwagon<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.389> technology

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
jumped on a bandwagon but the technology

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.170 
jumped on a bandwagon but the technology
was<00:02:28.049> not<00:02:28.079> sound<00:02:28.500> projection<00:02:29.400> technology<00:02:29.819> was

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
was not sound projection technology was

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.509 
was not sound projection technology was
garbage<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:31.139> the<00:02:31.680> camera<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.340> camera

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
garbage the the camera the camera

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.300 
garbage the the camera the camera
technology<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.209> limited<00:02:33.569> by<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.920> film

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
technology was limited by the the film

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.849 
technology was limited by the the film
based<00:02:35.810> technology<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.959> time<00:02:36.989> now<00:02:37.799> with

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
based technology of the time now with

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.160

digital<00:02:38.340> projection<00:02:38.700> digital<00:02:39.209> cameras<00:02:39.660> were

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
digital projection digital cameras were

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500 
digital projection digital cameras were
so<00:02:40.530> far<00:02:40.799> beyond<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.639> know<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.150> issues

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so far beyond on you know all the issues

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.009 
so far beyond on you know all the issues
of<00:02:42.600> eye<00:02:42.989> strain<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.269> brightness<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.569> sink

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
of eye strain and brightness and sink

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.309 
of eye strain and brightness and sink
and<00:02:46.440> all<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.010> they<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.319> ancient

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
and all that and they are ancient

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.470 
and all that and they are ancient
history<00:02:49.769> our<00:02:50.459> ability<00:02:50.819> to<00:02:50.849> manipulate<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
history our ability to manipulate the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.809 
history our ability to manipulate the
stereo<00:02:51.810> spaces<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.340> far<00:02:53.579> advanced<00:02:53.910> yeah

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
stereo spaces so so far advanced yeah

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.539 
stereo spaces so so far advanced yeah
and<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.319> guess<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:56.829> can<00:02:56.950> talk<00:02:57.129> a<00:02:57.159> little<00:02:57.370> bit

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
and so I guess we can talk a little bit

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.489 
and so I guess we can talk a little bit
more<00:02:57.730> about<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.689> tension<00:02:59.969> I<00:03:01.349> guess<00:03:02.349> just

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:02.499 
more about the the tension I guess just

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.500 
more about the the tension I guess just
the<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.129> attention<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.609> detail<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.299> guess

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the the attention to detail I guess

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.149 
the the attention to detail I guess
compared<00:03:05.049> with<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.739> know<00:03:05.829> prior

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
compared with you know prior

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.339 
compared with you know prior
technologies<00:03:06.819> like<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.569> know<00:03:07.689> being<00:03:08.079> able<00:03:08.200> to

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
technologies like you know being able to

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.250 
technologies like you know being able to
see<00:03:08.499> it<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.680> high<00:03:08.829> definition<00:03:09.069> and<00:03:10.049> could<00:03:11.049> you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
see it in high definition and could you

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.429 
see it in high definition and could you
talk<00:03:11.439> a<00:03:11.469> little<00:03:11.590> about<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.310> kind<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.519> the

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
talk a little about just the kind of the

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.599 
talk a little about just the kind of the
detail<00:03:14.439> that<00:03:14.469> M<00:03:14.799> you<00:03:14.889> know<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.099> visual<00:03:15.430> well

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
detail that M you know the visual well

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.369 
detail that M you know the visual well
we<00:03:15.879> pull<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.209> relatively<00:03:16.629> people<00:03:16.870> pulled

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
we pull this relatively people pulled

by<00:03:45.280> working<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.329> great<00:03:46.510> team<00:03:46.689> of<00:03:46.810> artists

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
by working with a great team of artists

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.979 
by working with a great team of artists
using<00:03:48.459> photographic<00:03:49.060> reference<00:03:49.629> of<00:03:49.780> what<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
using photographic reference of what a

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.069 
using photographic reference of what a
real<00:03:50.169> rain<00:03:50.409> forest<00:03:50.769> looks<00:03:50.949> like<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:51.340> then

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
real rain forest looks like and then

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.149 
real rain forest looks like and then
deconstructing<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.230> very<00:03:53.500> laborious<00:03:53.680> Lee

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
deconstructing that very laborious Lee

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.429 
deconstructing that very laborious Lee
so<00:03:54.340> we<00:03:54.459> understand<00:03:54.879> that<00:03:54.939> like<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:56.139> know<00:03:56.169> I

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
so we understand that like you know I

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.750 
so we understand that like you know I
mean<00:03:56.799> what<00:03:56.980> what<00:03:57.159> is<00:03:57.310> done<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.609> they've

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
mean what what is done is they've

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.520 
mean what what is done is they've
figured<00:03:57.969> out<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.169> when<00:03:59.290> light

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
figured out you know that when light

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.909 
figured out you know that when light
hits<00:03:59.769> a<00:04:00.009> leaf<00:04:00.220> it<00:04:01.090> reflects<00:04:01.509> off<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.750> leaf<00:04:02.109> it

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
hits a leaf it reflects off the leaf it

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.099 
hits a leaf it reflects off the leaf it
scatters<00:04:03.489> from<00:04:03.729> the<00:04:03.849> leaf<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.629> scatters

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
scatters from the leaf it scatters

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.379 
scatters from the leaf it scatters
through<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.590> leaf<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:06.579> now<00:04:06.729> we<00:04:06.790> have<00:04:07.120> all<00:04:07.239> this

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
through the leaf so now we have all this

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.479 
through the leaf so now we have all this
terminology<00:04:07.810> for<00:04:08.229> transmission<00:04:09.040> subsurface

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
terminology for transmission subsurface

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.399 
terminology for transmission subsurface
scattering<00:04:09.790> all<00:04:10.299> these<00:04:10.449> things<00:04:10.689> to<00:04:11.229> make<00:04:11.349> a

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
scattering all these things to make a

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.640 
scattering all these things to make a
single<00:04:11.709> leaf<00:04:12.040> look<00:04:12.310> right<00:04:12.549> in<00:04:13.209> sunlight

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
single leaf look right in sunlight

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.330 
single leaf look right in sunlight
took<00:04:15.250> years<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.180> development<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> then

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
took years of development and so then

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.879 
took years of development and so then
you<00:04:18.459> add<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.609> design<00:04:19.479> component<00:04:20.139> today<00:04:20.259> what

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
you add the design component today what

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.330 
you add the design component today what
is<00:04:20.979> are<00:04:21.130> particularly<00:04:21.850> Pandora<00:04:23.009> now<00:04:24.009> let's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
is are particularly Pandora now let's

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.790 
is are particularly Pandora now let's
make<00:04:24.490> all<00:04:24.729> that<00:04:24.880> look<00:04:25.120> real<00:04:25.389> to<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.750> eye

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
make all that look real to the eye

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.340 
make all that look real to the eye
instantly<00:04:26.800> if<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.520> look<00:04:27.729> I<00:04:27.850> mean<00:04:28.120> my<00:04:28.270> white<00:04:28.690> my

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
instantly if you look I mean my white my

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.469 
instantly if you look I mean my white my
way<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.949> judging<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:30.759> look<00:04:31.090> at<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> shot

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
way of judging it is I look at a shot

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.659 
way of judging it is I look at a shot
and<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.810> decide<00:04:32.110> instantly<00:04:32.979> doesn't<00:04:33.430> look<00:04:33.490> real

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
and I decide instantly doesn't look real

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.270 
and I decide instantly doesn't look real
enough<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:34.479> if<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.780> looks<00:04:34.930> real<00:04:35.169> I<00:04:35.470> don't<00:04:36.070> care

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
enough and if it looks real I don't care

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.650 
enough and if it looks real I don't care
that<00:04:36.340> much<00:04:36.580> about<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.910> details<00:04:37.270> even<00:04:37.570> though

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
that much about the details even though
