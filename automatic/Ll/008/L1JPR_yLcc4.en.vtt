to<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.209> your<00:02:15.360> viewfinder<00:02:15.709> then<00:02:16.709> back<00:02:16.980> lock

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to in your viewfinder then back lock

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.780 
to in your viewfinder then back lock
everything<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:18.379> back<00:02:19.379> away<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.129> use<00:02:20.610> your

everything down back away and use your

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
everything down back away and use your
remote<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> pictures

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
remote to take the pictures

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.420 
remote to take the pictures
now<00:02:23.849> when<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> push<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.540> button<00:02:25.080> as<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.890> shell

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
now when to push the button as the shell

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.430 
now when to push the button as the shell
is<00:02:26.730> leaving<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> ground<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.230> best

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
is leaving the ground that's the best

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.500 
is leaving the ground that's the best
time<00:02:28.709> you've<00:02:29.069> got<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.819> two-second<00:02:30.450> exposure

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
time you've got a two-second exposure

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.809 
time you've got a two-second exposure
most<00:02:31.290> shells<00:02:31.560> reach<00:02:31.950> their<00:02:32.220> height<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.790> a

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
most shells reach their height and a

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.360 
most shells reach their height and a
half<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.180> second<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.500> explosion<00:02:34.950> lasts

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
half a second and this explosion lasts

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.699 
half a second and this explosion lasts
maybe<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.760> second<00:02:36.180> or<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.170> that's<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.620> to

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
maybe a second or so so that's going to

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.369 
maybe a second or so so that's going to
give<00:02:37.890> plenty<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.849> time<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.780> explosion

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
give plenty of time for that explosion

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.670 
give plenty of time for that explosion
to<00:02:40.500> register<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.220> record<00:02:41.549> on<00:02:41.760> your<00:02:41.790> sensor

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
to register and record on your sensor

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.289 
to register and record on your sensor
once<00:02:43.680> you're<00:02:43.829> doing<00:02:44.099> that<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.819> taking<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
once you're doing that you're taking the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.130 
once you're doing that you're taking the
show<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:46.170> things<00:02:46.500> happen<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.780> approach

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
show as things happen as you approach

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.360 
show as things happen as you approach
the<00:02:49.380> end<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.650> show<00:02:49.860> you're<00:02:50.099> going<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.310> see

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the end of the show you're going to see

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.949 
the end of the show you're going to see
more<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.849> more<00:02:50.910> shells<00:02:51.360> firing

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
more and more shells firing

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.160 
more and more shells firing
simultaneously<00:02:53.329> this<00:02:54.329> can<00:02:54.660> cause<00:02:54.870> some

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
simultaneously this can cause some

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.860 
simultaneously this can cause some
overexposure<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.730> what<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> do<00:02:57.239> then<00:02:57.269> is

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
overexposure so what you do then is

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.559 
overexposure so what you do then is
start<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:59.040> stop<00:02:59.340> down<00:02:59.610> your<00:02:59.849> aperture<00:03:00.390> from

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
start to stop down your aperture from

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.440 
start to stop down your aperture from
f11<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:02.209> f-16<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.569> has<00:03:03.959> more<00:03:04.140> shells<00:03:04.500> appear

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
f11 to f-16 and has more shells appear

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.710 
f11 to f-16 and has more shells appear
f-22<00:03:06.860> if<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.099> can<00:03:08.280> go<00:03:08.579> even<00:03:08.910> smaller<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.599> your

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
f-22 if you can go even smaller on your

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.589 
f-22 if you can go even smaller on your
camera<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.940> experiment<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.239> little<00:03:12.480> too

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
camera do that experiment a little too

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.720 
camera do that experiment a little too
of<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.870> f-stop<00:03:13.260> change<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.099> back<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.519> forth

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
of that f-stop change it back and forth

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.610 
of that f-stop change it back and forth
during<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.239> finale<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.230> you're<00:03:16.440> more<00:03:16.560> likely

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
during the finale and you're more likely

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.210 
during the finale and you're more likely
to<00:03:17.040> get<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.310> really<00:03:17.670> good<00:03:17.850> shot<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.829> that's<00:03:19.980> how

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
to get a really good shot so that's how

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.270 
to get a really good shot so that's how
to<00:03:20.280> shoot<00:03:20.609> fireworks<00:03:21.170> from<00:03:22.170> me<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.680> cameras

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
to shoot fireworks from me and cameras

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.190 
to shoot fireworks from me and cameras
Brooklyn<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.600> wonderful<00:03:25.319> for<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.980> job
