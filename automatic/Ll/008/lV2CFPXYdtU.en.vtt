get started right there okay here's a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.249 
get started right there okay here's a
number<00:00:27.890> line<00:00:28.130> let's<00:00:28.790> put<00:00:29.060> another<00:00:29.210> line<00:00:29.450> below

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.210 
number line let's put another line below
it<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:31.150> now<00:00:32.150> let's<00:00:32.510> take<00:00:32.720> one<00:00:33.410> hole<00:00:33.830> and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
it and now let's take one hole and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.229 
it and now let's take one hole and
divide<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:35.000> into<00:00:35.120> two<00:00:35.629> equal<00:00:36.320> parts<00:00:37.150> in<00:00:38.150> other

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
divide it into two equal parts in other

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.439 
divide it into two equal parts in other
words<00:00:38.510> we<00:00:39.140> are<00:00:39.170> doing<00:00:39.530> 1<00:00:39.739> divided<00:00:40.489> by<00:00:40.519> 2<00:00:40.670> and

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
words we are doing 1 divided by 2 and

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.180 
words we are doing 1 divided by 2 and
remember<00:00:41.600> earlier<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.470> semester<00:00:42.620> I<00:00:42.949> said

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
remember earlier in the semester I said

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.680 
remember earlier in the semester I said
division<00:00:43.640> problems<00:00:44.000> are<00:00:44.120> represented<00:00:44.629> by

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
division problems are represented by

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.260 
division problems are represented by
fractions<00:00:45.290> so<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.040> division<00:00:46.489> problem<00:00:46.820> 1

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
fractions so that division problem 1

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.930 
fractions so that division problem 1
divided<00:00:47.719> by<00:00:47.750> 2<00:00:47.870> is<00:00:48.410> actually<00:00:48.950> represented<00:00:49.850> by

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
divided by 2 is actually represented by

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.470 
divided by 2 is actually represented by
the<00:00:50.000> fraction<00:00:50.480> 1/2<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:52.579> one<00:00:52.790> which<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.329> a

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
the fraction 1/2 the one which is a

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.420 
the fraction 1/2 the one which is a
number<00:00:53.809> on<00:00:54.079> the<00:00:54.350> top<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.739> fraction<00:00:54.950> is

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
number on the top of the fraction is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.270 
number on the top of the fraction is
called<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.969> numerator<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:57.290> 2<00:00:57.530> which<00:00:58.100> is

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
called the numerator and the 2 which is

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.770 
called the numerator and the 2 which is
the<00:00:58.460> number<00:00:58.820> on<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.149> bottom<00:00:59.360> of<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.600> fraction

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
the number on the bottom of the fraction

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.040 
the number on the bottom of the fraction
is<00:01:00.230> called<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.649> denominator<00:01:01.450> now<00:01:02.450> notice<00:01:02.809> it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
is called the denominator now notice it

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.830 
is called the denominator now notice it
takes<00:01:03.289> two<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.800> these<00:01:03.920> halves<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.910> make<00:01:05.089> up<00:01:05.300> one

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
takes two of these halves to make up one

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.859 
takes two of these halves to make up one
whole<00:01:06.080> number<00:01:06.440> right<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:08.479> makes<00:01:08.690> sense

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
whole number right it makes sense

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.050 
whole number right it makes sense
because<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.590> fraction<00:01:10.070> two<00:01:10.430> halves<00:01:10.700> is

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
because the fraction two halves is

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.940 
because the fraction two halves is
equivalent<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.110> division<00:01:12.440> problem<00:01:12.619> two

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
equivalent to the division problem two

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.800 
equivalent to the division problem two
divided<00:01:13.369> by<00:01:13.399> two<00:01:13.460> which<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:14.180> equivalent<00:01:14.570> to

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
divided by two which is equivalent to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.430 
divided by two which is equivalent to
one<00:01:16.390> now<00:01:17.390> when<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.630> have<00:01:17.750> fractions<00:01:18.320> that

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
one now when you have fractions that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.500 
one now when you have fractions that
represent<00:01:18.920> quantities<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.909> 1<00:01:20.270> or

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
represent quantities that are 1 or

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.399 
represent quantities that are 1 or
larger<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.650> call<00:01:21.890> those<00:01:22.040> improper<00:01:22.880> fractions

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
larger we call those improper fractions

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.280 
larger we call those improper fractions
proper<00:01:24.409> fractions<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.310> 1/2<00:01:25.820> lie<00:01:26.330> between<00:01:26.720> 0

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
proper fractions like 1/2 lie between 0

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
&amp; 1 on the number line let's continue on

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.399 
&amp; 1 on the number line let's continue on
to<00:01:33.530> some<00:01:33.770> more<00:01:34.299> improper<00:01:35.299> fractions<00:01:35.780> let's

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
to some more improper fractions let's

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.100 
to some more improper fractions let's
add<00:01:36.680> another<00:01:36.710> 1/2<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.880> gives<00:01:38.119> us<00:01:38.240> 3

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
add another 1/2 and that gives us 3

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.140 
add another 1/2 and that gives us 3
house<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.650> that's<00:01:40.070> equivalent<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> mixed

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
house and that's equivalent to the mixed

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.830 
house and that's equivalent to the mixed
number<00:01:41.479> 1<00:01:42.049> &amp;<00:01:42.320> 1/2<00:01:42.920> now<00:01:43.880> notice<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:44.540> are<00:01:44.630> using

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
number 1 &amp; 1/2 now notice we are using

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.300 
number 1 &amp; 1/2 now notice we are using
the<00:01:45.079> word<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.500> we<00:01:46.220> say<00:01:46.430> 1<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:47.150> 1/2<00:01:48.100> why<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.159> we

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
the word and we say 1 and 1/2 why do we

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.550 
the word and we say 1 and 1/2 why do we
call<00:01:49.490> these<00:01:49.700> mixed<00:01:50.060> numbers<00:01:50.390> because<00:01:50.960> they're

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
call these mixed numbers because they're

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.069 
call these mixed numbers because they're
mixed<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.369> whole<00:01:52.909> number<00:01:53.180> part<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.630> a

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
mixed with a whole number part and a

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.560 
mixed with a whole number part and a
fractional<00:01:54.619> part<00:01:54.970> now<00:01:55.970> let's<00:01:56.180> add<00:01:56.360> another

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
fractional part now let's add another

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.440 
fractional part now let's add another
1/2<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.350> gives<00:01:57.560> us<00:01:57.710> 4<00:01:58.280> halves<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.820> 4<00:01:59.119> divided

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
1/2 that gives us 4 halves and 4 divided

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.889 
1/2 that gives us 4 halves and 4 divided
by<00:01:59.479> 2<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.960> 2<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.729> four<00:02:02.360> halves<00:02:02.630> is

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
by 2 is 2 and so four halves is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.620 
by 2 is 2 and so four halves is
equivalent<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.470> two<00:02:03.770> wholes<00:02:04.280> if<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:05.540> had

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
equivalent to two wholes if we had

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.810 
equivalent to two wholes if we had
another<00:02:05.869> half<00:02:06.079> that<00:02:06.829> gives<00:02:07.009> us<00:02:07.100> 5<00:02:07.310> hops<00:02:07.579> and

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
another half that gives us 5 hops and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.900 
another half that gives us 5 hops and
that's<00:02:08.239> 2<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.810> 1/2<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.709> add<00:02:10.250> one<00:02:10.579> more<00:02:10.729> half

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
that's 2 and 1/2 and add one more half

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.509 
that's 2 and 1/2 and add one more half
and<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.299> gives<00:02:11.510> us<00:02:11.690> 6<00:02:12.530> halves<00:02:12.799> which<00:02:13.370> is

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
and that gives us 6 halves which is

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.550 
and that gives us 6 halves which is
equivalent<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.030> 3<00:02:14.329> that<00:02:14.870> makes<00:02:15.079> sense<00:02:15.350> because

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
equivalent to 3 that makes sense because

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.180 
equivalent to 3 that makes sense because
6<00:02:16.040> divided<00:02:16.489> by<00:02:16.519> 2<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:17.030> 3<00:02:17.769> now<00:02:18.769> let's<00:02:18.950> talk<00:02:19.130> a

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
6 divided by 2 is 3 now let's talk a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.310 
6 divided by 2 is 3 now let's talk a
little<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:19.579> about<00:02:19.700> mixed<00:02:20.150> numbers<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.690> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
little bit about mixed numbers and the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.790 
little bit about mixed numbers and the
improper<00:02:22.390> fraction<00:02:23.390> representation<00:02:24.319> of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
improper fraction representation of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.120 
improper fraction representation of
mixed<00:02:25.069> numbers<00:02:26.440> here<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.860> have

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
mixed numbers here we have

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.300 
mixed numbers here we have
three<00:02:28.280> halves<00:02:29.020> now<00:02:30.020> remember<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.740> saw<00:02:30.920> earlier

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
three halves now remember we saw earlier

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.580 
three halves now remember we saw earlier
that<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:32.300> one<00:02:32.480> half<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.870> equivalent<00:02:33.350> to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
that one in one half is equivalent to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.420 
that one in one half is equivalent to
three<00:02:33.860> halves

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
three halves

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.430 
three halves
well<00:02:34.820> how<00:02:35.000> do<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.210> change<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.720> mixed<00:02:35.930> number<00:02:36.140> to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
well how do you change a mixed number to

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.010 
well how do you change a mixed number to
its<00:02:36.950> improper<00:02:37.910> fraction<00:02:38.570> representation

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
its improper fraction representation

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.760 
its improper fraction representation
well<00:02:39.920> here's<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> procedure<00:02:41.350> we<00:02:42.350> have<00:02:42.380> 1/2

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
well here's the procedure we have 1/2

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.710 
well here's the procedure we have 1/2
seer<00:02:43.070> right<00:02:43.250> because<00:02:43.430> we<00:02:43.550> have<00:02:43.640> 1<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:43.970> 1/2<00:02:44.330> and

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
seer right because we have 1 in 1/2 and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.480 
seer right because we have 1 in 1/2 and
now<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.620> take<00:02:45.920> 2<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.520> multiply<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.330> by<00:02:47.450> 1<00:02:47.780> and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
now we take 2 and multiply it by 1 and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.430 
now we take 2 and multiply it by 1 and
that<00:02:49.490> gives<00:02:49.550> us<00:02:49.760> 2<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:50.810> are<00:02:50.870> you<00:02:50.960> doing<00:02:51.260> there

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
that gives us 2 what are you doing there

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.400 
that gives us 2 what are you doing there
well<00:02:51.980> when<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.910> do<00:02:53.060> 2<00:02:53.300> times<00:02:53.540> 1<00:02:53.870> you're

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
well when you do 2 times 1 you're

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.710 
well when you do 2 times 1 you're
figuring<00:02:54.860> out<00:02:55.040> how<00:02:55.640> many<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.910> those<00:02:56.090> halves

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
figuring out how many of those halves

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.290 
figuring out how many of those halves
it<00:02:56.840> takes<00:02:57.170> up<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.710> make<00:02:57.860> up<00:02:58.040> your<00:02:58.520> whole<00:02:59.000> number

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
it takes up to make up your whole number

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.630 
it takes up to make up your whole number
part<00:02:59.600> in<00:02:59.810> this<00:02:59.960> case<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:00.860> 1<00:03:01.160> as<00:03:01.340> our<00:03:01.430> whole

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
part in this case we have 1 as our whole

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.670 
part in this case we have 1 as our whole
number<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.480> our<00:03:02.780> mixed<00:03:03.440> number

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
number in our mixed number

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.000 
number in our mixed number
representation<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:06.260> does<00:03:06.500> take<00:03:06.740> two

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
representation and it does take two

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.590 
representation and it does take two
halves<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.610> make<00:03:07.640> up<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.970> one<00:03:08.120> whole<00:03:08.300> so

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
halves to make up the one whole so

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.030 
halves to make up the one whole so
that's<00:03:08.780> why<00:03:08.930> when<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.200> do<00:03:09.290> two<00:03:09.470> times<00:03:09.650> one<00:03:09.860> you

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
that's why when you do two times one you

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.280 
that's why when you do two times one you
get<00:03:10.160> 2<00:03:10.460> but<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.330> mixed<00:03:11.570> number<00:03:11.810> has<00:03:12.080> an

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
get 2 but the mixed number has an

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.860 
get 2 but the mixed number has an
additional<00:03:12.740> fractional<00:03:13.490> part<00:03:13.730> an<00:03:13.940> additional

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
additional fractional part an additional

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.410 
additional fractional part an additional
1/2<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:16.160> we<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.700> add<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.180> additional

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
1/2 so we have to add that additional

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.810 
1/2 so we have to add that additional
1/2<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.440> when<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.460> look<00:03:19.580> at<00:03:19.700> your

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
1/2 and when you look at your

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.510 
1/2 and when you look at your
calculation<00:03:20.330> here<00:03:20.480> 2<00:03:20.750> plus<00:03:20.990> 1<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.200> 3<00:03:21.320> and<00:03:21.740> you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
calculation here 2 plus 1 is 3 and you

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.720 
calculation here 2 plus 1 is 3 and you
have<00:03:22.550> halves<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.480> 1<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.470> 1/2<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.340> equivalent

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
have halves so 1 and 1/2 is equivalent

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.760 
have halves so 1 and 1/2 is equivalent
to<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.090> improper<00:03:26.480> fraction<00:03:26.630> three<00:03:27.530> hops

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
to the improper fraction three hops

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.110 
to the improper fraction three hops
there<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.430> go<00:03:29.560> now<00:03:30.560> let's<00:03:30.740> take<00:03:30.920> one<00:03:31.880> whole

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
there you go now let's take one whole

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.530 
there you go now let's take one whole
and<00:03:32.330> divide<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.870> into<00:03:32.990> three<00:03:33.200> equal<00:03:33.470> parts

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
and divide it into three equal parts

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.350 
and divide it into three equal parts
that's<00:03:35.540> equivalent<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:36.070> 1/3<00:03:37.070> or<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.060> fraction

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
that's equivalent to 1/3 or the fraction

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.830 
that's equivalent to 1/3 or the fraction
one-third<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.530> notice<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.790> takes<00:03:41.030> three<00:03:41.720> of

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
one-third and notice it takes three of

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.540 
one-third and notice it takes three of
these<00:03:41.960> thirds<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.980> make<00:03:43.130> up<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:44.480> whole<00:03:45.170> number

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.280 

now<00:03:49.550> let's<00:03:49.730> add<00:03:49.910> another<00:03:50.210> third<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:51.080> gives

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
now let's add another third that gives

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.680 
now let's add another third that gives
us<00:03:51.440> four<00:03:51.770> thirds<00:03:52.070> that's<00:03:52.730> equivalent<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.360> one

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
us four thirds that's equivalent to one

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.080 
us four thirds that's equivalent to one
and<00:03:53.990> one-third<00:03:54.770> if<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:55.460> had<00:03:55.580> another<00:03:55.820> third

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
and one-third if we had another third

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.360 
and one-third if we had another third
that's<00:03:56.480> five<00:03:56.780> thirds<00:03:57.110> that's<00:03:57.680> equivalent<00:03:58.100> to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's five thirds that's equivalent to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.090 
that's five thirds that's equivalent to
one<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.240> two<00:03:59.570> thirds<00:03:59.780> we<00:04:00.709> had<00:04:00.830> another

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
one and two thirds we had another

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.280 
one and two thirds we had another
one-third<00:04:01.610> that's<00:04:02.390> six<00:04:02.720> thirds<00:04:02.959> that's

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
one-third that's six thirds that's

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.890 
one-third that's six thirds that's
equivalent<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:04.130> two<00:04:04.340> we<00:04:05.330> had<00:04:05.450> another<00:04:05.660> third

equivalent to two we had another third

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.780 
equivalent to two we had another third
what<00:04:06.050> do<00:04:06.110> we<00:04:06.200> get<00:04:06.320> Charlie<00:04:06.350> seven<00:04:07.220> thirds<00:04:07.370> very

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
what do we get Charlie seven thirds very

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.730 
what do we get Charlie seven thirds very
nice<00:04:08.030> that's<00:04:08.390> equivalent<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.959> two<00:04:09.440> and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
nice that's equivalent to two and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.830 
nice that's equivalent to two and
one-third<00:04:10.240> what<00:04:11.240> do<00:04:11.330> we<00:04:11.390> get<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.600> we<00:04:11.690> had

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
one-third what do we get if we had

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.020 
one-third what do we get if we had
another<00:04:12.020> one<00:04:12.200> Charlie<00:04:12.500> 1/3<00:04:13.160> very<00:04:13.459> nice<00:04:13.700> and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
another one Charlie 1/3 very nice and

another one Charlie 1/3 very nice and
that's<00:04:14.540> equivalent<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:15.170> two<00:04:15.770> and<00:04:16.130> two<00:04:16.549> thirds

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
that's equivalent to two and two thirds

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.580 
that's equivalent to two and two thirds
all<00:04:17.390> right<00:04:17.540> Charlie<00:04:17.780> bring<00:04:17.989> us<00:04:18.140> on<00:04:18.260> what<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.500> we

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
all right Charlie bring us on what do we

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.770 
all right Charlie bring us on what do we
get<00:04:18.770> thank<00:04:19.280> thirds<00:04:19.670> very<00:04:20.090> nice<00:04:20.330> and<00:04:20.690> that

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
get thank thirds very nice and that

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.170 
get thank thirds very nice and that
makes<00:04:20.959> sense<00:04:21.260> 9<00:04:21.500> divided<00:04:22.010> by<00:04:22.040> 3<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.580> equivalent

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
makes sense 9 divided by 3 is equivalent

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.480 
makes sense 9 divided by 3 is equivalent
to<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.660> number<00:04:23.690> 3<00:04:24.170> now<00:04:24.920> let's<00:04:25.100> try<00:04:25.310> some

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
to the number 3 now let's try some

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.660 
to the number 3 now let's try some
problems<00:04:25.640> we<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.720> 2/3<00:04:27.260> plus<00:04:27.800> 3/3<00:04:28.430> now

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
problems we have 2/3 plus 3/3 now

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.910 
problems we have 2/3 plus 3/3 now
charlie<00:04:29.060> if<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.810> have<00:04:29.930> two<00:04:30.260> thirds<00:04:30.560> and

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
charlie if you have two thirds and

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.760 
charlie if you have two thirds and
somebody<00:04:31.730> gives<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.060> 3<00:04:32.480> more<00:04:32.690> thirds<00:04:33.110> how

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
somebody gives you 3 more thirds how

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.070 
somebody gives you 3 more thirds how
many<00:04:33.980> thirds<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.310> have<00:04:34.550> five<00:04:35.060> thirds<00:04:35.420> that's

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
many thirds you have five thirds that's

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.190 
many thirds you have five thirds that's
it<00:04:36.350> it's<00:04:36.890> that<00:04:36.919> easy<00:04:37.280> okay<00:04:37.640> so<00:04:38.060> if<00:04:38.780> we<00:04:38.900> have<00:04:38.930> two

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
it it's that easy okay so if we have two

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.650 
it it's that easy okay so if we have two
thirds

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.630 

and<00:04:41.750> we<00:04:41.840> add<00:04:41.990> three<00:04:42.230> more<00:04:42.260> thirds<00:04:43.040> we

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
and we add three more thirds we

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.150 
and we add three more thirds we
obviously<00:04:43.820> end<00:04:44.150> up<00:04:44.270> at<00:04:44.480> five<00:04:45.080> thirds<00:04:45.410> well<00:04:46.010> how

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
obviously end up at five thirds well how

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.050 
obviously end up at five thirds well how
do<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.370> show<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:46.610> work<00:04:46.820> with<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
do you show you work with the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.170 
do you show you work with the
calculation<00:04:47.630> well<00:04:48.170> we<00:04:49.010> have<00:04:49.160> thirds<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.790> we

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
calculation well we have thirds and we

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.940 
calculation well we have thirds and we
work<00:04:50.390> with<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.630> numerators<00:04:51.140> we<00:04:51.440> simply<00:04:51.770> say

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
work with the numerators we simply say

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.310 
work with the numerators we simply say
two<00:04:52.370> plus<00:04:52.820> three<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.480> put<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.230> our

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
two plus three and put that in our

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.710 
two plus three and put that in our
numerator<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.920> two<00:04:55.400> plus<00:04:55.640> three<00:04:55.670> is<00:04:56.060> equal<00:04:56.570> to

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
numerator and two plus three is equal to

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.680 
numerator and two plus three is equal to
five<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.230> so<00:04:57.530> our<00:04:57.860> answer<00:04:58.130> is<00:04:58.270> 5/3<00:04:59.270> there<00:04:59.600> you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
five and so our answer is 5/3 there you

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.010 
five and so our answer is 5/3 there you
go

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
go

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.990 
go
so<00:05:00.530> your<00:05:00.680> denominator<00:05:01.190> does<00:05:01.520> not<00:05:01.550> change

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
so your denominator does not change

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.530 
so your denominator does not change
right<00:05:03.400> now<00:05:04.400> suppose<00:05:04.700> we<00:05:04.880> have<00:05:05.000> eight<00:05:05.270> thirds

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
right now suppose we have eight thirds

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.740 
right now suppose we have eight thirds
subtract<00:05:06.410> four<00:05:06.980> thirds<00:05:07.310> well<00:05:07.700> if<00:05:08.450> we<00:05:08.660> have

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
subtract four thirds well if we have

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.620 
subtract four thirds well if we have
eight<00:05:09.020> thirds<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.860> we<00:05:10.640> take<00:05:10.850> away<00:05:11.000> four

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
eight thirds and we take away four

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.570 
eight thirds and we take away four
thirds<00:05:11.990> we're<00:05:12.860> obviously<00:05:13.040> going<00:05:13.310> to<00:05:13.370> end<00:05:13.490> up

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
thirds we're obviously going to end up

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.450 
thirds we're obviously going to end up
at<00:05:13.760> four<00:05:14.060> thirds<00:05:14.450> that's<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.380> well<00:05:16.190> how<00:05:16.280> do<00:05:16.340> you

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
at four thirds that's it well how do you

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.160 
at four thirds that's it well how do you
show<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.670> work<00:05:16.850> we're<00:05:17.510> working<00:05:17.780> with<00:05:17.900> thirds

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
show you work we're working with thirds

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.990 
show you work we're working with thirds
and<00:05:18.500> now<00:05:18.710> notice<00:05:19.400> we<00:05:19.610> work<00:05:19.790> with<00:05:19.940> the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
and now notice we work with the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.510 
and now notice we work with the
numerators<00:05:20.510> eight<00:05:20.960> subtract<00:05:21.410> 4<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.980> 8

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
numerators eight subtract 4 and 8

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.090 
numerators eight subtract 4 and 8
subtract<00:05:22.910> 4<00:05:23.810> is<00:05:24.140> 4<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.150> our<00:05:26.150> answer<00:05:26.450> is<00:05:26.600> 4/3<00:05:27.590> so

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
subtract 4 is 4 and our answer is 4/3 so

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.160 
subtract 4 is 4 and our answer is 4/3 so
there<00:05:28.700> you<00:05:28.790> go<00:05:28.940> that's<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.450> brief<00:05:29.630> introduction
