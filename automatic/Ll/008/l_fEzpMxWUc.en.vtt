00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
this is the first one it's quarter of

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.450 
this is the first one it's quarter of
the<00:00:12.269> whole<00:00:12.420> map<00:00:12.690> credit<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.799> black<00:00:14.009> fella<00:00:14.309> for

the whole map credit to black fella for

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.070 
the whole map credit to black fella for
giving<00:00:14.700> me<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.880> super<00:00:15.179> flat<00:00:15.389> map<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:15.780> anyway

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
giving me the super flat map but anyway

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.840 
giving me the super flat map but anyway
so<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> start<00:00:16.920> off<00:00:16.949> with<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.310> chest<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
so you start off with this chest and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.429 
so you start off with this chest and
this<00:00:17.940> chest<00:00:18.240> gives<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.539> five<00:00:18.779> ladders<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
this chest gives you five ladders and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
this chest gives you five ladders and
that<00:00:19.949> will<00:00:20.130> let<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> cheat<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.730> five<00:00:21.240> levels

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that will let you cheat on five levels

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.859 
that will let you cheat on five levels
now<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.869> use<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.170> wisely<00:00:22.320> because<00:00:22.710> there's<00:00:23.189> 22

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
now you use it wisely because there's 22

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.179 
now you use it wisely because there's 22
so<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.170> 1/4<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> levels<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
so that's about 1/4 of the levels you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.830 
so that's about 1/4 of the levels you
can<00:00:26.369> cheat<00:00:26.609> on<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.880> recommend<00:00:27.300> trying<00:00:27.660> them

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
can cheat on I recommend trying them

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.339 
can cheat on I recommend trying them

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
let's give a flyby of all the parkour so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.130 
let's give a flyby of all the parkour so
there's<00:00:34.200> 22<00:00:34.680> stages<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.550> said<00:00:35.989> I'm<00:00:36.989> gonna

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

there's 22 stages like I said I'm gonna
call<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.410> stages<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.360> as<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.230> see<00:00:40.430> they

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
call them stages and as you can see they

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.319 
call them stages and as you can see they
very<00:00:42.260> did<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.500> got<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> couple<00:00:44.040> oh<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.789> only<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
very did I got a couple oh the only I

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.690 
very did I got a couple oh the only I
only<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.680> definitely<00:00:47.340> will

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
only have one that you definitely will

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.779 
only have one that you definitely will
die<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> fail<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:50.070> that's<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.520> third

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
die on if you fail and that's the third

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
die on if you fail and that's the third
one<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.510> worry<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.739> recommend

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
one so don't worry and I recommend

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.970 
one so don't worry and I recommend
sleeping<00:00:53.579> whenever<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.000> nighttime<00:00:54.390> because

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
sleeping whenever it's nighttime because

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
sleeping whenever it's nighttime because
of<00:00:55.980> course<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.480> won't<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> restart<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of course you won't have to restart and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
of course you won't have to restart and
if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> um<00:00:59.609> if<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:01.379> die<00:01:02.329> which<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
if you and if you um if you die which is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
if you and if you um if you die which is
very<00:01:03.660> unlikely<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.890> every<00:01:05.129> chest<00:01:05.400> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
very unlikely because in every chest you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.300 
very unlikely because in every chest you
get<00:01:05.700> food<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.439> die<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.100> just

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
get food so if you do die you know just

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.859 
get food so if you do die you know just
have<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
have to get you're gonna have to do the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
have to get you're gonna have to do the
stage<00:01:10.080> again<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.159> farthest<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> slept<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
stage again the farthest you slept so I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
stage again the farthest you slept so I
recommend<00:01:12.630> sleeping<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.260> soon<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.680> often<00:01:14.130> as

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
different styles and it took me very

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
different styles and it took me very
long<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.290> made<00:01:25.560> by

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
long to make all of this was made by

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.810 
long to make all of this was made by
hand<00:01:26.729> took<00:01:27.299> forever<00:01:27.979> play<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.130> peaceful<00:01:29.430> all

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
this and I can't fly through this ones

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
this and I can't fly through this ones
like<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> maze<00:01:32.670> slash<00:01:33.090> parkour<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.930> that's

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
like a maze slash parkour so that's

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
like a maze slash parkour so that's
pretty<00:01:34.350> interesting<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
pretty interesting and then this one is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
pretty interesting and then this one is
I<00:01:37.140> don't<00:01:37.770> even<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> describe<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.820> as
