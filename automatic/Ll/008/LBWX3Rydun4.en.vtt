so<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.049> seems<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.530> guess<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.069> have<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.400> new

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
so it seems like I guess we have a new

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.830 
so it seems like I guess we have a new
version<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.299> these<00:03:21.310> no<00:03:22.310> Aviators<00:03:23.090> we<00:03:23.750> have

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
version of these no Aviators we have

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.660 
version of these no Aviators we have
chains<00:03:24.230> now<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.859> actually<00:03:25.010> pretty<00:03:25.430> cool

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
chains now this is actually pretty cool

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.819

no<00:03:25.849> I<00:03:26.030> know<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.510> probably<00:03:26.989> can't<00:03:27.260> see<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:27.769> I

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829

anyway like I said we're gonna be doing

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.290 
anyway like I said we're gonna be doing
the<00:05:12.470> cars<00:05:12.740> I'll<00:05:13.039> be<00:05:13.280> going<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.700> depth<00:05:13.910> on<00:05:14.090> each

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
the cars I'll be going in depth on each

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.230 
the cars I'll be going in depth on each
car<00:05:14.600> and<00:05:14.840> probably<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.979> boat<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.550> got<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.120> see

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
car and probably the boat I got to see

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.520 
car and probably the boat I got to see
what<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.479> boats<00:05:17.690> all<00:05:17.840> about<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:18.229> everything

what the boats all about and everything

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.840 
what the boats all about and everything
because<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:18.890> think<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.310> actually<00:05:19.580> works<00:05:19.729> with

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850

Pegasus<00:05:20.270> that's<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:21.650> can't<00:05:21.890> really<00:05:22.039> do<00:05:22.190> too
