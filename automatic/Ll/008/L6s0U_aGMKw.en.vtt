00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
right here i believe it's probably the

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:55.959 
right here i believe it's probably the
going<00:06:54.590> places<00:06:54.740> you<00:06:54.979> can<00:06:55.099> actually<00:06:55.189> do<00:06:55.490> it's

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:55.969 
going places you can actually do it's

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.850 
going places you can actually do it's
not<00:06:56.120> one<00:06:56.270> of<00:06:56.330> those<00:06:56.449> skills<00:06:56.780> or<00:06:56.900> it's<00:06:57.020> like<00:06:57.259> you

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
not one of those skills or it's like you

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.559 
not one of those skills or it's like you
got<00:06:57.979> it<00:06:58.099> like<00:06:58.219> guess<00:06:58.460> where<00:06:58.669> the<00:06:58.879> best<00:06:59.060> spot<00:06:59.419> is

00:06:59.559 --> 00:06:59.569 
got it like guess where the best spot is

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:01.270 
got it like guess where the best spot is
for<00:06:59.750> training<00:07:00.080> a<00:07:00.139> cut<00:07:00.349> it's<00:07:00.889> like<00:07:01.009> your<00:07:01.159> only

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
for training a cut it's like your only

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.860 
for training a cut it's like your only
option<00:07:01.789> basically<00:07:01.969> unless<00:07:02.330> you<00:07:02.539> want<00:07:02.719> to<00:07:02.780> let

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
option basically unless you want to let

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.050 
option basically unless you want to let
go<00:07:02.900> get<00:07:03.319> slower<00:07:03.620> experience<00:07:04.129> but<00:07:04.909> yeah

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
go get slower experience but yeah

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.339 
go get slower experience but yeah
hopefully<00:07:05.389> you<00:07:05.599> guys<00:07:05.689> enjoyed<00:07:05.990> the<00:07:06.050> video<00:07:06.169> and
