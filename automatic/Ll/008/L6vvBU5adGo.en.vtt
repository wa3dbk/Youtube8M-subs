something unless you can't move but

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.760 
something unless you can't move but
Mayweather<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.809> known<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.379> he's<00:00:46.500> gonna<00:00:46.680> move

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
Mayweather is known to he's gonna move

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.000 
Mayweather is known to he's gonna move
off<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> line<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.690> he<00:00:48.690> might<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.260> those

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
off the line and he might not get those

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
off the line and he might not get those
shots<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.579> Marikana<00:00:51.000> hit<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.719> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
different fighter now like since

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
different fighter now like since
training<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.110> robberies<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.950> me<00:01:11.100> he's

training with robberies to me he's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.490 
training with robberies to me he's
completely<00:01:11.820> different<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.869> uses<00:01:13.049> jab

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
completely different like he uses jab

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.350 
completely different like he uses jab
more<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.130> even<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.549> yeah<00:01:14.820> he<00:01:14.970> does<00:01:15.150> he<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
more and even more yeah he does he I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
more and even more yeah he does he I
think<00:01:16.350> he's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> completely<00:01:16.920> different

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
think he's a completely different

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
think he's a completely different
fighter<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:18.330> years<00:01:18.450> ago<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.930> he

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
fighter from two years ago when he

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
fighter from two years ago when he
fought<00:01:19.229> aamir<00:01:19.500> khan<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> me<00:01:20.640> that's<00:01:20.790> why<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
fought aamir khan and to me that's why I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.740 
fought aamir khan and to me that's why I
would<00:01:21.030> make<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> interesting<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.689> think

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
would make it interesting I think

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
would make it interesting I think
because<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.680> other<00:01:22.830> guys<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.159> Canelo<00:01:23.430> we

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
because the other guys like Canelo we

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.560 
because the other guys like Canelo we
all<00:01:23.759> thought<00:01:23.880> Cannella<00:01:24.180> would<00:01:24.360> press

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
all thought Cannella would press

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.609 
all thought Cannella would press
Mayweather<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.020> he<00:01:25.170> didn't<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.439> he

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
Mayweather and he didn't do that he

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
Mayweather and he didn't do that he
decided<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.009> box<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> middle<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> ring<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.360> in

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
decided a box and middle the ring and in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.179 
decided a box and middle the ring and in
a<00:01:27.630> bind<00:01:27.840> him<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.829> he<00:01:28.920> did<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
a bind him and but because he did that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
a bind him and but because he did that
and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.310> think<00:01:29.340> Madonna<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.299> press

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and I think Madonna would just press

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.050 
and I think Madonna would just press
them<00:01:31.259> all<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.920> way<00:01:32.009> through<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.939> mention

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
them all the way through I don't mention

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
them all the way through I don't mention
Canelo<00:01:33.479> he's<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> fight<00:01:34.200> n<00:01:34.320> gulo<00:01:34.680> what

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
Canelo he's going to fight n gulo what

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
Canelo he's going to fight n gulo what
do<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.430> matchup<00:01:36.049> um<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
do you think about that matchup um I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.490 
do you think about that matchup um I
think<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.270> personally<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.659> Cano<00:01:40.290> might

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
think I just personally that Cano might

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.240 
think I just personally that Cano might
be<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.860> too<00:01:40.950> sharp<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.400> angulo<00:01:43.250> they're

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
be a little too sharp for angulo they're

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.370 
be a little too sharp for angulo they're
both<00:01:44.430> strong<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.149> everything<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:45.930> Cornell

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
both strong and everything but Cornell

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
both strong and everything but Cornell
has<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.950> good<00:01:47.130> boxing<00:01:47.640> skills<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.270> he's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
has pretty good boxing skills and he's

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.960 
has pretty good boxing skills and he's
young<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> he<00:01:49.020> does<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.490> he's<00:01:50.490> very<00:01:50.729> good

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
young and he does have he's very good

of power yeah well words like Manny had
a<00:02:17.160> little<00:02:17.520> bit<00:02:17.610> more<00:02:17.760> snap<00:02:18.060> know<00:02:18.660> many<00:02:18.930> has

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
a little bit more snap know many has

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.890 
a little bit more snap know many has
more<00:02:19.410> snap<00:02:19.740> but<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.459> not<00:02:21.209> as<00:02:21.390> much<00:02:21.540> power

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
more snap but that is not as much power

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.980 
more snap but that is not as much power
but<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.620> Verna<00:02:22.950> force<00:02:23.280> had<00:02:23.570> good<00:02:24.570> hidden<00:02:24.810> power

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
but a Verna force had good hidden power

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.140 
but a Verna force had good hidden power
you<00:02:25.709> would<00:02:25.860> say<00:02:26.010> he<00:02:26.190> would<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> one<00:02:26.640> he'd

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
you would say he would be the one he'd

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.790 
you would say he would be the one he'd
be<00:02:27.330> probably<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.690> hardest<00:02:28.020> hitter<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.470> that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
be probably the hardest hitter that that

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.699 
be probably the hardest hitter that that
