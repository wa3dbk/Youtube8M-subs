00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 and in any case we have said that yes 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.920
 they can also plant as for themselves 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.250
 they can reproduce it by losing it 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.540
 now from March to June 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.119
 taking branches I'll show you to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.840
 seriously no no it won't be all Italy 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.400
 come then it takes these branches 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.530
 this because we want it already two years 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.360
 and a year that provides for a year e 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.369
 this is a one-year branch this is here 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.800
 two of these two for two years 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.660
 seen for a year ok if you don't do anything else 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:38.229
 that you take leaves like that 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:42.940
 this service ticks both take 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.840
 this now I put even less than later 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.320
 lets say that you should crush a 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.350
 a little 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.869
 here, however, with a hammer on a piece of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.259
 wood gets ok pole cried up here ie 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.410
 about 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.740
 more than half you put it underground and it 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.050
 you have to keep the weight to cure ie it is not 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.660
 you put it there then comes from serious and then 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.849
 one like the sage away at this you owe it 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:15.489
 put here in a vase and then siani 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.770
 with possibly a saucer for 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.050
 all summer and you'll see that from here 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.239
 start making law morning 9 a 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.360
 saucer to keep the humidity certain 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.599
 and then if you have a mandarin plant 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.730
 of this this species without is not there 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.940
 need to stay on 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.800
 it sure is the long and laborious thing and you 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.599
 I must say that they also have problems a 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.760
 level 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.090
 I still find one score for now though 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.239
 are are a little weaker lee curtis e 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.080
 why not having a radical apparatus 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.150
 like bitter orange or like life 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.640
 of the American were systems that there 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.170
 he wanted more time to do it however I am 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.849
 immortals 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.980
 unlike plants that do now 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.959
 how they make life and now seeing that 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.290
 the table graft covering a small branch 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.110
 like this 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.069
 this piece is wild this piece a 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.239
 eye in the states put them on the ground 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.030
 Ticino who wanted to plant but not 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.829
 they have the same strength as the old 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.659
 system that they observed with 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:26.689
 earth made us a radical apparatus 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:28.849
 it is done a little earlier perhaps even at a 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.909
 result then I am much more fragile 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.310
 this is more fragile the better first is 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.310
 that's the one of the least getting for 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.650
 keep you gotta do wild that graft 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.829
 that is the best system in all 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.129
 then plants are already looking for Christmas 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.919
 however, there are so many systems to lay the ground 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.019
 the best is that of and therefore this 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.970
 this method also applies to lemon 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.290
 applies if everyone is there for everyone in me citrus 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.609
 I made myself at home when 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.040
 pianigiani made those I did 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.870
 I did it by itself and if you put it in 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.169
 vase well if you put it instead on the ground 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.900
 the first few years we need no, no, it should be done 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:08.540
 in the jar in the dirt must be cared for put 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.129
 in the shade correct here does not put there every 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.440
 as much of a lamp as cure how 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.669
 no saucers where the sun is not there 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.799
 peaks so much force then and after 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.810
 after 23 years see that the plant does 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.479
 begin to develop first year maybe 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.419
 he makes little booties and then after he wants 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.940
 say that if evening is learned there is when 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.310
 doing so has less to feed on 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.340
 but certainly there is, however, there is the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.620
 leaf that a little sun takes it 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.960
 this is the only way that is a way if not 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.419
 come on if you call me but describe in 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.419
 wild and therefore easy on the wild 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.580
 you insert one of these if necessary 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.599
 from the seed from the squares in the summer and if 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.090
 it comes from the seed you will never get life 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:56.120
 the absurd Peking plant and the first 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.550
 months that I have done to chianni in merit 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.550
 that you do this from 6,000 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.050
 which is the best that is in the sense made 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.069
 it takes time it takes 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.529
 a little bird comes first year 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:13.680
 so the first one believes us then after no no 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:16.770
 because they are an exaggerated root system 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.310
 but then after the second year he leaves later 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.580
 three years graft it ok so first two 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.469
 years grows free so in the third year 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.430
 if you let it go but you can come one 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.060
 apple 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.039
 who knows of the 600 years ago and now maybe 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.080
 a goal that depends depends 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.529
 sometimes of the poor of the apples but 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.379
 almost never almost never prevails itself because the 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.719
 wild always prevails on which 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.580
 because stronger and stronger September if the 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:47.879
 quicker than the abandon of stresses 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.729
 there is a tribute that does not happen to 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:53.250
 graft risotto but the photos succeeded 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.099
 out there no invested in these two 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.610
 trees here no I have to tell the truth though 7 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.120
 Pigasse 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.009
 if it should come out and the wild a 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.830
 a certain point makes you bother this 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.360
 here even then it should be cut 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.439
 immediately the pen cut 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:14.520
 Battle searched because they are strongly 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:19.039
 the plant gives them priority but the tip 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.039
 of these mandarins and passion
