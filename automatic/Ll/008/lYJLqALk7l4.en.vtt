00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.200
 became the foundation of the new region alexey 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 Gordeeva 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.870
 and as I promised 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.519
 I conducted additional tests 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:11.579
 canon 550d cameras 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.549
 two times in the first offense 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:14.779
 regression is checked 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.939
 however moulder endurance 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.630
 first in the chamber then the tatar blocks 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.159
 the thing is but we are his friend in Chinese 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.240
 battery packs in 5 km ordubad 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150
 he says native batteries 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.939
 charged twice as fast as in china 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.480
 to shield yourself 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.759
 trouble 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.760
 spent it 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.150
 in my case 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.780
 CCTV Cameras 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.450
 would write one battery led 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 almost equally in both 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430
 being in a fully charged cell 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.150
 the battery is completely empty 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.660
 after 1 hour 45 minutes 42 seconds continuous 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.340
 shooting pharmacists now 80 n 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.340
 being battery on unit 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 the same battery worked 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 one hour 39 minutes 4 seconds 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.760
 let's go to the results 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.830
 overheating test chamber 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100
 I draw your attention to the fact that 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.790
 This time the camera did not differ from 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.750
 overheating 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.290
 more than one and a half hours of materials without 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.090
 stop finding 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.310
 and the overheating indicator blinked closer 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.690
 circus 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.730
 despite the fact that the temperature in 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.140
 the room was about thirty degrees 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.980
 celsius 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.450
 like the first time 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.310
 I have two suggestions for 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.250
 about the reasons that might be 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 explain perhaps the first reason 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 this is a shooting format 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.820
 during the first tests when about 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.450
 after 50 minutes and the camera turned off due to 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.270
 overheating 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.100
 filming was conducted in 720p format 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.720
 at 60 frames per second 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.540
 It is possible that such a shooting speed 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.970
 heavier process load than 25 frames 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.330
 in a second and it is heated more 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.520
 the second possible reason is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.230
 amount of light falling on 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.170
 matrix 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.310
 during the first train in sight 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.390
 camera hit the window 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.829
 from which it fell 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.230
 plenty of daylight 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.700
 The survey was carried out with the number of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.180
 ohhh during the second arrival the amount 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.019
 the light was much less 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.870
 also residents had to increase the presser 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.079
 force 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.159
 now the government of the country 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.889
 this is literally the first and last 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.439
 shooting frames 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.639
 I carefully and compared the letter 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.369
 notice the difference in color noise 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.779
 it seems to me 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.029
 final table footage present barely 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.019
 noticeable increase in graininess and light 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.879
 warming colors 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.040
 you can compare one more time 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.949
 got into 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.549
 most noticeable changes in total 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.359
 prize pool 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.339
 the final frame appeared clearly 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.869
 reddish tint 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:47.249
 There have already been problems with sharpness 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.459
 the image has become blurred 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.609
 let's summarize our tests 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.689
 the discharge time of my battery 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.689
 kambiasso 52 does not depend on where he is 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.719
 or donated blocks 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.580
 the second 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.540
 time and place 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.629
 shooting market 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.469
 I think the camera canon 550d can be 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.909
 more than one and a half hours 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.659
 but the result is a long 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.459
 use overheated cameras 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.279
 may be a change in color tone 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:16.059
 red yellow side 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:17.719
 and 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.450
 weight loss so I was finishing 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.649
 overheating test chamber canon 550d 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:25.979
 with you was an inexperienced vlog Fedor 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:26.909
 the region 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.259
 goodbye 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:31.519
 when the scenario dollars 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.239
 she lets people he added 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.040
 a few days later he's three weeks 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.709
 and the same thing is important 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.489
 so you can not cost 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.810
 created for this question is possible 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.449
 setting 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.719
 so in a meeting
