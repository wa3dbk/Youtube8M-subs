00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hello everybody and today I have a

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello everybody and today I have a
gameplay<00:00:03.179> for<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:03.629> on<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.110> map<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.680> nobody

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
gameplay for you on the map that nobody

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.270 
gameplay for you on the map that nobody
ever<00:00:05.490> upload<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.720> map<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.020> never<00:00:07.620> uploaded

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
ever upload this map is never uploaded

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.390

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
to any YouTube channel ever and I think

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
to any YouTube channel ever and I think
it's<00:00:11.670> because<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:12.269> regular<00:00:12.780> game<00:00:12.990> modes<00:00:13.230> it

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it's because in regular game modes it

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.810 
it's because in regular game modes it
doesn't<00:00:13.679> really<00:00:13.799> come<00:00:14.009> into<00:00:14.040> rotation<00:00:14.730> that

much but in ground war obviously because

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.040
