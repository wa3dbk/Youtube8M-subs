Chelsea season
oh<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.979> changed<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.579> think<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:22.020> they

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
oh I changed I think they I think they

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380 
oh I changed I think they I think they
can't<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.710> happy<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> season<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
can't be happy with the season in the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
can't be happy with the season in the
league<00:01:24.509> especially<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.439> finish<00:01:25.890> in

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
league especially with the to finish in

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.539 
league especially with the to finish in
six<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:27.689> want<00:01:27.899> but<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:29.369> won

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
six this not what they want but they won

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.069 
six this not what they want but they won
the<00:01:29.670> Cup<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.039> they<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.929> they<00:01:33.929> have

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the Cup so I think they they they have

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
the Cup so I think they they they have
confidence<00:01:34.500> from<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.039> last<00:01:35.220> week's<00:01:35.520> they

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
confidence from the last week's they

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.880 
confidence from the last week's they
they<00:01:36.149> got<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.569> good<00:01:36.689> results<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:37.679> played

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they got some good results they played

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
they got some good results they played
better<00:01:38.100> than<00:01:38.640> before<00:01:38.819> most<00:01:39.420> parts<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.899> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
better than before most parts of the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 
better than before most parts of the
season<00:01:40.289> so<00:01:41.069> I<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> ended<00:01:42.090> deserve

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
season so I think and it ended deserve

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.929 
season so I think and it ended deserve
to<00:01:42.719> to<00:01:43.229> reach<00:01:43.679> the<00:01:43.860> final<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.340> mean<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> pick

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to to reach the final I mean if you pick

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.899 
to to reach the final I mean if you pick
out<00:01:45.060> Barcelona<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.770> deserve<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.429> here<00:01:47.610> and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
League finals first time and I think

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390

it's<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.230> big<00:02:22.410> big<00:02:22.590> advantage<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.099> Bayern

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it's a big big advantage for Bayern

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.699 
it's a big big advantage for Bayern
Munich<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.329> are<00:02:24.450> clear<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.440> head

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
Munich so if they are clear in the head

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.830 
Munich so if they are clear in the head
mentally<00:02:26.100> strong<00:02:26.639> I<00:02:26.910> think<00:02:27.420> they<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> big

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
mentally strong I think they have a big

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.390 
mentally strong I think they have a big
advantage<00:02:28.109> Marko<00:02:28.739> smashing<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.160> see<00:02:29.280> you
