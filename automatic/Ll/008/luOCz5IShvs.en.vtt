00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.059
 in my name rafael mauricio be 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.650
 paternal I entered the program 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.980
 aeronautical engineering of the university 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.660
 in the year 2007 left Colombia colony 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.080
 was my space engineering teacher in 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.490
 in 2009 I came to teach classes like 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.099
 teacher researcher in the program of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.450
 aeronautical engineering and from ccoo 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.460
 time I'm linked from the university 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.050
 they are parameters according to my 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.369
 qualifications that the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.470
 Polytechnic University of Warsaw 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.640
 I got half a scholarship from Poland and 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.829
 half scholarship from the university 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.120
 here in the engineering program 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.120
 aerospace for female doctors 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.540
 Well first thank all the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.329
 teachers during the five years that 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.530
 I was inside the university I think 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.629
 it's a university that has a plus 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.489
 additional is that it not only forms 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.219
 one as a professional but the part 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.500
 human is very strong then that 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.750
 we help them strengthen it as 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.399
 person and for help a lot I think 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.710
 that what I went out to do was 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.080
 a spatial mineral teacher with emphasis 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.450
 in propulsion in that part of the race 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.220
 we have Russian professors from other parts 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.080
 that were very good then for that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.250
 reason we were very strong in that in that 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.289
 area when the teacher arrives I did not have 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.700
 no academic problem and it 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.960
 will present a problem with the language and 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.780
 not even for English and not for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.670
 polish everything not academically with very 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.289
 good I know of companions that also 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.940
 they did other masters since they really 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.619
 we are doing very well now in this moment 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.330
 there are more students in the polytechnic 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.590
 warsaw doing masters and always 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.479
 we have left a very good name those who 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.210
 we have been from the san buenaventura a 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.340
 Greetings to all I believe that things 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.649
 depend on one the university gave us 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.340
 the bases that we needed to 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.810
 undertake not only masters to 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.729
 be doctorates and well to see that yes 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.780
 we can with those with many students who 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.049
 I had to leave 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.790
 country and that really depends on one the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.110
 university already gave us the bases no 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.299
 only fit as professionals 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.070
 but also as people as a person and 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.780
 It helps us a lot and the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.190
 universities that I know outside of 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.320
 country we have had a very good name you 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.670
 then invite them all the same imposes 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.810
 also the open doors that a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.810
 university that has helped us a lot
