so<00:02:12.090> moving<00:02:12.329> on<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.599> we've<00:02:12.720> got<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.900> power

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
so moving on here we've got the power

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.770 
so moving on here we've got the power
extender<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:14.159> socket<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.269> power

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
wrapper of the macbook pro take enough

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.729 
wrapper of the macbook pro take enough
testing<00:02:45.659> so<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.930> don't<00:02:46.319> know<00:02:46.379> if<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.650> take

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
testing so I don't know if you can take

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:47.990 
testing so I don't know if you can take
it<00:02:46.889> back<00:02:46.950> after<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.280> taken<00:02:47.549> up<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.790> around

it back after you taken up and around

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.119 
it back after you taken up and around
isn't<00:02:48.269> sure<00:02:48.480> they're<00:02:49.349> taking<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:49.680> off<00:02:49.739> we

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the cover off quickly you also got the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
the cover off quickly you also got the
full<00:03:04.409> glass<00:03:04.590> crack<00:03:04.859> crack<00:03:05.069> their<00:03:05.310> which

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
full glass crack crack their which

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.830 
full glass crack crack their which
doesn't<00:03:05.489> wear<00:03:05.909> down<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:06.299> obvious<00:03:06.599> class

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
doesn't wear down because obvious class

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.690 
doesn't wear down because obvious class
as<00:03:07.170> opposed<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.859> plastic<00:03:08.340> ones<00:03:08.489> on

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
as opposed to the plastic ones on

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.509 
as opposed to the plastic ones on
cheaper<00:03:09.120> computers<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.709> turning<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.340> can

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
cheaper computers so turning on you can

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.690 
cheaper computers so turning on you can
hear<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.819> bong<00:03:12.769> move<00:03:13.769> every<00:03:14.099> map<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.549> can

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
hear the bong move every map and you can
