I let my grill a little bit more though

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.469 
I let my grill a little bit more though
because<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:15.670> reason<00:01:15.880> just<00:01:16.060> looks<00:01:16.210> better<00:01:16.330> on

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
because some reason just looks better on

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.140 
because some reason just looks better on
my<00:01:16.660> face<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:18.460> from<00:01:18.670> your<00:01:18.940> nose

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
my face and then right from your nose

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.630 
my face and then right from your nose
you're<00:01:19.510> going<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.750> tilt<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.290> go<00:01:21.280> right<00:01:21.490> in<00:01:21.580> the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
you're going to tilt it go right in the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280 
you're going to tilt it go right in the
middle<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.940> your<00:01:22.000> eye<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.450> that's<00:01:22.990> where<00:01:23.200> your

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
middle of your eye and that's where your

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.020 
middle of your eye and that's where your
arch<00:01:23.440> should<00:01:23.650> be<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:23.979> then<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.520> tilt<00:01:24.940> a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
arch should be and then you tilt a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.300 
arch should be and then you tilt a
little<00:01:25.060> bit<00:01:25.360> further<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.990> very<00:01:26.380> corners

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
little bit further to the very corners

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.310 
little bit further to the very corners
of<00:01:27.460> your<00:01:27.580> eye<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.210> that's<00:01:28.930> where<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:29.259> should

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
of your eye and that's where it should

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.170 
of your eye and that's where it should
end<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:30.070> that's<00:01:30.190> how<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.490> shape<00:01:30.759> it<00:01:30.880> if<00:01:31.030> you're

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
end so that's how you shape it if you're

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.840 
end so that's how you shape it if you're
just<00:01:31.360> wondering<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.950> basic<00:01:33.369> shape<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.670> your

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
just wondering the basic shape of your

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.700 
just wondering the basic shape of your
eyebrow<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.300> how<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:34.570> should<00:01:34.690> be<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.530> is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
eyebrow and how it should be so this is

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.830 
eyebrow and how it should be so this is
how<00:01:36.130> my<00:01:36.280> eyebrow<00:01:36.580> looks<00:01:37.320> naturally<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.600> just

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
how my eyebrow looks naturally it's just

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.029 
how my eyebrow looks naturally it's just
like<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:40.990> straight<00:01:41.350> line<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.619> hair<00:01:41.770> right<00:01:41.920> here

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
like a straight line of hair right here

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.290 
like a straight line of hair right here
because<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.399> don't<00:01:42.580> have<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.729> lot<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.910> hair<00:01:43.119> that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
because I don't have a lot of hair that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.630 
because I don't have a lot of hair that
grows<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:44.740> here<00:01:44.950> for<00:01:45.100> some<00:01:45.130> reason<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:45.550> I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
grows over here for some reason but I

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.469 
grows over here for some reason but I
have<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.789> lot<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.090> grows<00:01:46.450> over<00:01:46.690> there

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.870 

so<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.619> way<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.920> trim<00:01:52.189> my<00:01:52.219> eyebrows<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.850> I

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
so the way that I trim my eyebrows is I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.639 
so the way that I trim my eyebrows is I
actually<00:01:53.060> take<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> brush<00:01:53.719> like<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.560> I

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
actually take a brush like this and I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.569 
actually take a brush like this and I
use<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.759> brush<00:01:56.299> side<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.930> push<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.009> hairs<00:01:58.250> up

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
use the brush side I push the hairs up

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.709 
use the brush side I push the hairs up
like<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.090> forced<00:01:59.539> them<00:01:59.810> to<00:02:00.789> go<00:02:01.789> upwards<00:02:02.329> like

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
like I forced them to go upwards like

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.380 
like I forced them to go upwards like
that<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.320> then<00:02:03.890> I'll<00:02:04.189> take<00:02:04.429> my<00:02:04.610> scissors<00:02:04.880> and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
that and then I'll take my scissors and

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.100 
that and then I'll take my scissors and
just<00:02:05.420> trim<00:02:05.750> down<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.979> make<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.310> straight<00:02:08.110> but

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
just trim down to make it straight but

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
try and follow this natural curve of

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.960

your<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:20.080> your<00:03:20.350> eyebrow<00:03:20.769> but<00:03:21.610> at<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.819> same

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
your of your eyebrow but at the same

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.580 
your of your eyebrow but at the same
time<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.360> want<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.630> format<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.170> way<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.319> want

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
time you want to format the way you want

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.800 
time you want to format the way you want
so<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.830> like<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.489> be<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> very<00:03:24.819> high<00:03:25.150> arch<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
so I like it to be a very high arch and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.470 
so I like it to be a very high arch and
then<00:03:25.930> go<00:03:26.080> straight<00:03:26.140> down<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.610> starting<00:03:28.180> right

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
then go straight down so starting right

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.009 
then go straight down so starting right
where<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.440> top<00:03:29.620> my<00:03:29.739> arches

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
where the top my arches

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.400 
where the top my arches
I'm<00:03:32.019> gonna<00:03:32.230> keep<00:03:32.799> my<00:03:33.070> brush<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.579> my<00:03:33.610> skin<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
I'm gonna keep my brush on my skin and

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.819 
I'm gonna keep my brush on my skin and
start<00:03:35.799> forming<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.350> over<00:03:38.680> like

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
start forming it I I do it over like

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.000 
start forming it I I do it over like
about<00:03:39.130> five<00:03:39.489> times<00:03:42.390> fill<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.799> because<00:03:44.799> you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
about five times fill it in because you

00:03:45.010 --> 00:04:10.520 
about five times fill it in because you
want<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.220> to<00:03:45.370> be<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.880> darkest

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.000 

so<00:04:11.240> that<00:04:12.240> is<00:04:12.570> ultimately<00:04:13.350> how<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.560> shape<00:04:13.950> my

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
so that is ultimately how I shape my

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.599 
so that is ultimately how I shape my
eyebrows<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:15.440> then<00:04:16.440> I'm<00:04:16.620> going<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.980> take

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
eyebrows and then I'm going to take

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.410 
eyebrows and then I'm going to take
I<00:04:18.140> brought<00:04:19.140> gel<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:20.340> is<00:04:20.400> from<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.060> body<00:04:21.269> shop

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
I brought gel this is from the body shop

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.350 
I brought gel this is from the body shop
round<00:04:22.200> last<00:04:22.530> job<00:04:22.830> it's<00:04:23.550> not<00:04:23.640> brown<00:04:23.970> like<00:04:24.180> this

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
round last job it's not brown like this

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.300 
round last job it's not brown like this
but<00:04:24.600> -<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.110> use<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.500> much<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.950> supposed<00:04:26.160> to

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
but - I use it so much it's supposed to

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.820 
but - I use it so much it's supposed to
clear<00:04:27.320> looks<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.600> take<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.440> push

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
clear looks like this I take it and push

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.620 
clear looks like this I take it and push
all<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.370> hairs<00:04:32.610> up<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:34.220> out<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.640> then<00:04:36.480> I<00:04:36.600> just

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
all the hairs up and out and then I just

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:44.200 
all the hairs up and out and then I just
go<00:04:36.990> over<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.380> top<00:04:37.410> ones

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.980 

and<00:04:44.720> then<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:44.990> looks<00:04:45.139> like<00:04:45.229> that

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.499
