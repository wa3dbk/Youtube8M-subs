fact here um this kid had an it around
three<00:02:29.829> years<00:02:30.069> ago<00:02:30.189> this<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.329> same<00:02:31.510> manner

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
three years ago this is the same manner

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.640 
three years ago this is the same manner
in<00:02:31.900> hasn't<00:02:32.200> evolved<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:34.629> it<00:02:34.930> was<00:02:35.049> just<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.409> if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
