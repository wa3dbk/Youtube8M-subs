yeah<00:00:11.290> and<00:00:12.090> he<00:00:13.090> wanted<00:00:13.360> to<00:00:13.480> know<00:00:13.570> what<00:00:13.900> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
yeah and he wanted to know what the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.580 
yeah and he wanted to know what the
likes<00:00:15.849> me<00:00:16.240> staying<00:00:16.689> at<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.080> zoo<00:00:17.259> by<00:00:17.380> one

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
likes me staying at the zoo by one

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.620 
likes me staying at the zoo by one
around<00:00:19.080> solving<00:00:20.080> it<00:00:20.380> and<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:22.270> really<00:00:22.509> easy

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
around solving it and it's really easy

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.080 
around solving it and it's really easy
and<00:00:23.200> it's<00:00:23.739> really<00:00:23.919> easy<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.250> build<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.910> truth

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and it's really easy to build the truth

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.220 
and it's really easy to build the truth
and<00:00:28.090> you<00:00:28.149> can<00:00:28.360> only<00:00:28.509> scramble<00:00:28.930> out<00:00:28.989> so<00:00:29.110> many

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
and you can only scramble out so many

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.510 
and you can only scramble out so many
ways<00:00:29.349> so<00:00:30.279> it's<00:00:30.430> really<00:00:30.520> easy<00:00:30.759> I<00:00:31.059> mean<00:00:32.520> it's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
ways so it's really easy I mean it's

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.360 
ways so it's really easy I mean it's
just<00:00:33.640> like<00:00:33.910> as<00:00:34.030> if<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.360> kinda<00:00:34.750> like<00:00:34.960> yeah<00:00:35.370> I'll

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
just like as if I kinda like yeah I'll

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.869 
just like as if I kinda like yeah I'll
just<00:00:36.789> to<00:00:37.059> spin<00:00:37.269> it<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.280> I<00:00:39.309> do<00:00:39.460> sir<00:00:39.579> no

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
just to spin it you can I do sir no

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.819 
just to spin it you can I do sir no
somebody<00:00:40.210> moves<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:40.539> like<00:00:40.719> yeah<00:00:41.260> that's

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
somebody moves so like yeah that's

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.599 
somebody moves so like yeah that's
basically<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.629> can<00:00:43.749> do<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.489> I'm

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
basically what you can do and I'm

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.340 
basically what you can do and I'm
working<00:00:48.760> on<00:00:48.940> finding<00:00:49.329> some<00:00:49.600> stickers<00:00:50.109> to<00:00:50.320> put

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
working on finding some stickers to put

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.329 
working on finding some stickers to put
on<00:00:50.559> there<00:00:50.710> so<00:00:50.859> it<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.100> look<00:00:51.249> like<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:52.629> by<00:00:52.749> to

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
on there so it it look like for by to

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.279 
on there so it it look like for by to
tell<00:00:54.339> the<00:00:54.429> dog<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.730> stop<00:00:54.940> hobby<00:00:55.510> stupid<00:00:56.140> dogs

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
tell the dog to stop hobby stupid dogs

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.509 
tell the dog to stop hobby stupid dogs
ok<00:00:56.800> so<00:00:56.859> then<00:00:57.640> puppies<00:00:58.300> solve<00:00:58.929> it<00:00:59.079> it's<00:00:59.409> just<00:00:59.649> a

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
ok so then puppies solve it it's just a

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.320 
ok so then puppies solve it it's just a
lie-in<00:01:01.210> oh<00:01:01.600> it's<00:01:02.319> just<00:01:02.559> basically<00:01:02.949> is<00:01:03.399> if<00:01:04.210> you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
lie-in oh it's just basically is if you

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.640 
lie-in oh it's just basically is if you
want<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.720> get<00:01:04.839> around<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.170> little<00:01:05.290> bit<00:01:05.440> you'll

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
want to get around a little bit you'll

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.690 
want to get around a little bit you'll
get<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:09.070> real<00:01:09.370> easy<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:11.550> well<00:01:12.550> this

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
get it and it's real easy so well this

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.560 
get it and it's real easy so well this
was<00:01:12.850> useful<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.770> very<00:01:15.250> fun<00:01:15.550> yeah<00:01:16.030> it's<00:01:16.300> it's

was useful it's very fun yeah it's it's
fun<00:01:16.900> and<00:01:17.140> amusing<00:01:17.470> how's<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.400> snake<00:01:18.700> once<00:01:18.970> you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
fun and amusing how's the snake once you

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.180 
fun and amusing how's the snake once you
learn<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.780> solve<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.350> pretty<00:01:20.650> much<00:01:20.710> can't

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
learn to solve it you pretty much can't

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:31.080 
learn to solve it you pretty much can't
not<00:01:21.370> solve<00:01:21.670> it<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:29.980> it<00:01:30.550> moves<00:01:30.790> really<00:01:30.970> well

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
not solve it and it moves really well

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.000 
not solve it and it moves really well
for<00:01:31.450> being<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:31.840> puzzle<00:01:32.140> built<00:01:32.290> like<00:01:32.590> most<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.980> my

for being a puzzle built like most of my
puzzle<00:01:33.370> builds<00:01:33.610> said<00:01:33.850> they<00:01:34.210> don't<00:01:34.330> move<00:01:34.540> very

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
puzzle builds said they don't move very

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.290 
puzzle builds said they don't move very
well<00:01:35.010> unless<00:01:36.010> they<00:01:36.370> started<00:01:36.910> off<00:01:36.970> with<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.150> good

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
well unless they started off with a good

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.590 
well unless they started off with a good
cube<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.870> this<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:39.610> really<00:01:39.790> easy<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.240> make<00:01:40.270> you

cube and this is really easy to make you

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.110 
cube and this is really easy to make you
just<00:01:40.800> get<00:01:41.800> four<00:01:42.100> key<00:01:42.460> chains<00:01:42.730> that's<00:01:42.970> what<00:01:43.090> I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
just get four key chains that's what I

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.530 
just get four key chains that's what I
did<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:44.050> then<00:01:44.260> you<00:01:44.410> keep<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:46.150> got<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.360> phone
