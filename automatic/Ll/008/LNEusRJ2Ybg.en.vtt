00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
that's the blocking phone I think

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
that's the blocking phone I think
Michael<00:00:56.910> Bush<00:00:57.090> missed<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> blocking

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
Michael Bush missed the blocking

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.650

assignment<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.390> that's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
assignment and then that so that that's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.720 
assignment and then that so that that's
what<00:01:00.899> led<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> interception<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.309> then

what led to that interception and then

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.759 
what led to that interception and then
the<00:01:02.850> fumble<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.329> course<00:01:03.600> was<00:01:03.840> also<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> blocking

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the fumble of course was also a blocking

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.429 
the fumble of course was also a blocking
problem<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:06.240> offensive<00:01:06.510> line<00:01:06.659> blew<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
problem the offensive line blew that so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.920 
problem the offensive line blew that so
two<00:01:08.040> big<00:01:08.640> mistakes<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> offensive<00:01:09.780> line

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
two big mistakes by the offensive line

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.980 
two big mistakes by the offensive line
that<00:01:10.380> caused<00:01:10.619> turnovers<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:12.299> Michael

that caused turnovers and or Michael
Bush<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> failed<00:01:13.890> block<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.430> other

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
Bush for that failed block but other

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.810 
Bush for that failed block but other
than<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:16.650> satisfying<00:01:17.369> game<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
than that a very satisfying game you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.340 
than that a very satisfying game you
know<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> penalties<00:01:18.420> were<00:01:18.630> cut<00:01:18.840> down<00:01:18.869> they

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
know the penalties were cut down they

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
know the penalties were cut down they
weren't<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.710> painful<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:21.000> there

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
weren't as painful there I think there

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.520 
weren't as painful there I think there
was<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.299> duck<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:21.810> times<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.229> had<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
was that duck two times they had that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
was that duck two times they had that
holding<00:01:22.890> calls<00:01:23.240> on<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.630> drive<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
holding calls on that one drive that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
holding calls on that one drive that
stalled<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.330> now<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> penalties<00:01:27.780> weren't

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
stalled but now the penalties weren't

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.270 
stalled but now the penalties weren't
those<00:01:28.140> painful<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.040> weren't<00:01:29.250> very

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
those painful was there weren't very

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.219 
those painful was there weren't very
many<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.670> those<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.570> any<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:30.990> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
many of those have not any at all so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.280 
many of those have not any at all so
that's<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.590> good<00:01:31.740> sign<00:01:32.960> start<00:01:33.960> off<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> game

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that's a good sign start off the game

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890
