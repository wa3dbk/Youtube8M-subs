remarkable difference changing over to a

remarkable difference changing over to a
handgun<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.939> m9<00:00:28.279> as<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:29.699> i

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
handgun this is the m9 as you can see i

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.220 
handgun this is the m9 as you can see i
haven't<00:00:30.000> got<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.480> trigger<00:00:30.750> finger

haven't got a very good trigger finger

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.420 
haven't got a very good trigger finger
but<00:00:31.920> putting<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> model<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.250> see

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
but putting the model you can see

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.060 
but putting the model you can see
there's<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> remarkable<00:00:36.329> difference<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
there's a remarkable difference this is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
there's a remarkable difference this is
a<00:00:38.100> good<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:40.160> if<00:00:41.160> we're<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.489> last<00:00:41.520> stand<00:00:42.410> or

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
a good for if we're in last stand or

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.660 
a good for if we're in last stand or
just<00:00:43.860> want<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:44.969> cocky<00:00:45.510> i<00:00:45.539> suppose

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
just want to be really cocky i suppose

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.619 
just want to be really cocky i suppose

off button in you can see that the gun
is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.460> lot<00:01:02.609> faster<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.660> showing<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is a lot faster and just showing you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.790 
is a lot faster and just showing you
like<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800

isn't<00:01:14.270> really<00:01:14.660> that<00:01:15.020> fast<00:01:15.260> by<00:01:16.100> putting<00:01:16.400> the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
isn't really that fast by putting the

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.810 
isn't really that fast by putting the
model<00:01:17.710> allows<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.100> increase<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.580> speed

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
model allows you to increase the speed

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.630 
model allows you to increase the speed
and<00:01:20.330> matically<00:01:20.930> which<00:01:21.680> is<00:01:21.860> very<00:01:22.100> good<00:01:22.160> for<00:01:22.490> in

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
and matically which is very good for in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.200 
and matically which is very good for in
your<00:01:22.790> last<00:01:23.030> stand<00:01:23.860> changing<00:01:24.860> over<00:01:25.070> now<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:26.090> an

your last stand changing over now to an
m21<00:01:26.840> sniper<00:01:27.590> rifle<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:29.270> some<00:01:29.510> cases<00:01:29.750> this

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
m21 sniper rifle in some cases this

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.890 
m21 sniper rifle in some cases this
isn't<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:30.530> good<00:01:30.800> when<00:01:31.310> sniper<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.240> walking

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
isn't so good when sniper in but walking

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.960 
isn't so good when sniper in but walking
around<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.740> doesn't<00:01:34.100> save<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.760> from<00:01:34.910> having

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
around it doesn't save you from having

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.780 
around it doesn't save you from having
to<00:01:35.360> change<00:01:35.690> gun<00:01:37.210> as<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.810> see<00:01:39.670> zooming<00:01:40.670> in

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
to change gun as you can see zooming in

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.080 
to change gun as you can see zooming in
it's<00:01:41.330> quite<00:01:41.690> all<00:01:41.900> right<00:01:42.190> reload<00:01:43.190> but<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's quite all right reload but the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
it's quite all right reload but the
modern<00:01:44.390> zoo<00:01:44.720> means<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:47.000> focus<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.570> still<00:01:47.720> okay

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
modern zoo means the focus is still okay

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.030 
modern zoo means the focus is still okay
but<00:01:49.100> if<00:01:49.190> you're<00:01:49.310> walking<00:01:49.460> around<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:50.119> can

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
but if you're walking around you can

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.300 
but if you're walking around you can
shoot<00:01:52.040> someone<00:01:52.460> like<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.060> was<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> machine<00:01:53.869> gun

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
shoot someone like it was a machine gun

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.680 
shoot someone like it was a machine gun
changing<00:01:55.310> over<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:57.580> handgun<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:59.619> USP<00:02:01.690> you

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
changing over to a a handgun the USP you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.130 
changing over to a a handgun the USP you
can<00:02:02.869> see<00:02:03.050> is<00:02:03.110> rather<00:02:03.350> slow<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:05.450> reloading<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
can see is rather slow but reloading and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.270 
can see is rather slow but reloading and
putting<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.950> model<00:02:08.619> allows<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.950> go<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.100> lot

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
putting the model allows you to go a lot

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.060 
putting the model allows you to go a lot
faster<00:02:10.489> now<00:02:12.310> changing<00:02:13.310> over<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> Barrett<00:02:14.090> 50

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
faster now changing over to a Barrett 50

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.560 
faster now changing over to a Barrett 50
there's<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.220> massive<00:02:16.670> difference<00:02:16.970> within<00:02:17.330> this

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
there's a massive difference within this

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.670 
there's a massive difference within this
gun

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.420 

you<00:02:25.219> can<00:02:25.400> see<00:02:25.689> about<00:02:26.689> the<00:02:26.870> mod<00:02:27.159> it's<00:02:28.159> rather

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you can see about the mod it's rather

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.740 
you can see about the mod it's rather
slow<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:32.180> by<00:02:32.299> pressing<00:02:32.659> the<00:02:32.750> modern<00:02:34.599> you<00:02:35.599> can

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
slow but by pressing the modern you can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.649 
slow but by pressing the modern you can
see<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:35.959> it's<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.230> lot<00:02:36.439> faster<00:02:37.359> but<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.510> aim

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
see that it's a lot faster but the aim

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.270 
see that it's a lot faster but the aim
is<00:02:38.959> nowhere<00:02:39.680> near<00:02:39.829> as<00:02:39.920> good<00:02:39.950> or<00:02:40.519> clear

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
is nowhere near as good or clear

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.020 
is nowhere near as good or clear
changing<00:02:43.280> over<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.829> handgun<00:02:45.829> now<00:02:46.030> which

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
changing over to the handgun now which

changing over to the handgun now which
is<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:49.129> m-19<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.379> see<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.269> still

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
is the m-19 you can see that is still

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.970 
is the m-19 you can see that is still
quite<00:02:54.019> slow<00:02:54.260> if<00:02:54.379> you<00:02:54.469> haven't<00:02:54.680> got<00:02:54.769> a<00:02:54.799> good

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
quite slow if you haven't got a good

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.569 
quite slow if you haven't got a good
trigger<00:02:55.159> finger<00:02:55.579> but<00:02:55.879> by<00:02:56.030> putting<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.450> model
