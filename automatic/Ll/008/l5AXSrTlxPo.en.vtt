itself anyway as you can see I'm just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
itself anyway as you can see I'm just
comparing<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> two<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.289> different<00:00:55.949> models

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
comparing the two of different models

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.000 
comparing the two of different models
here<00:00:56.370> we've<00:00:56.579> got<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> Instax<00:00:57.360> Mini<00:00:57.710> 8<00:00:58.710> here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
here we've got the Instax Mini 8 here

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.910 
here we've got the Instax Mini 8 here
comparing<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.000> ins<00:01:00.149> deck<00:01:00.449> near<00:01:01.230> 90<00:01:01.680> now

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
comparing it to the ins deck near 90 now

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.460 
comparing it to the ins deck near 90 now
and<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.510> 8<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.110> slightly

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
and you can see that the 8 is slightly

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
and you can see that the 8 is slightly
bigger<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.670> definitely<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.210> plasticky

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
bigger and is definitely more plasticky

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
bigger and is definitely more plasticky
and<00:01:07.020> build<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.650> has<00:01:07.860> less<00:01:08.100> features<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and build and has less features on it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
and build and has less features on it
and<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.350> nice<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.860> very<00:01:10.920> much

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and this is very nice it's very much

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.429 
and this is very nice it's very much
like<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.549> sort<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.939> almost<00:01:12.180> livery<00:01:12.720> feel<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
like a sort of almost livery feel and it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.830 
like a sort of almost livery feel and it
definitely<00:01:13.979> has<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> much<00:01:14.640> more<00:01:14.850> retro<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> nicer

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
really an expert when it comes to taking

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.170 
really an expert when it comes to taking
double<00:03:50.380> exposure<00:03:50.770> shots<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.610> these<00:03:52.030> are

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
double exposure shots and these are

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.910 
double exposure shots and these are
pretty<00:03:52.330> average<00:03:52.570> but<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.290> can't<00:03:53.560> seem<00:03:53.890> to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
pretty average but you can't seem to

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.650 
pretty average but you can't seem to
achieve<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.459> lot<00:03:54.760> with<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.090> camera<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.600> it's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
achieve a lot with this camera and it's

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.880 
achieve a lot with this camera and it's
definitely<00:03:55.959> got<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.200> lot<00:03:56.350> more<00:03:56.410> creative

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
definitely got a lot more creative

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.710 
definitely got a lot more creative
control<00:03:57.040> than<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.850> had<00:03:58.000> on<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.269> other<00:03:58.300> kind

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
control than you had on the other kind

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.110 
control than you had on the other kind
of<00:03:58.840> Instamatic<00:03:59.440> cameras<00:03:59.800> out

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.520 
so just for the fact that it has some
creative<00:04:03.030> features<00:04:03.720> makes<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.290> much<00:04:04.500> more

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
