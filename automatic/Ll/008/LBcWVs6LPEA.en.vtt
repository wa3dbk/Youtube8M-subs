let's get right into the video now the
top<00:00:28.230> part<00:00:28.380> about<00:00:28.560> making<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.980> gun<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
top part about making this gun was the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.279 
top part about making this gun was the
fact<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.210> many<00:00:30.660> images<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
fact that I don't have many images to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
fact that I don't have many images to
refer<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> enough<00:00:32.610> perspective<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> get<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
refer to enough perspective use to get a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.139 
refer to enough perspective use to get a
full-on<00:00:33.920> view<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.219> gun<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> kind<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
full-on view of this gun so I kind of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
full-on view of this gun so I kind of
decided<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> make<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> prototype<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> what

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
decided just to make a prototype of what

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.350 
decided just to make a prototype of what
I<00:00:37.860> could<00:00:37.980> visualize<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.820> what<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> could<00:00:39.120> see

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I could visualize and what I could see

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840 
I could visualize and what I could see
so<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.290> could<00:00:40.559> whip<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.340> something<00:00:41.520> quick

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
so that I could whip up something quick

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.729 
so that I could whip up something quick
and<00:00:42.000> then<00:00:42.210> spend<00:00:42.600> time<00:00:42.840> using<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and then spend time using the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.080 
and then spend time using the
measurements<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> reference<00:00:44.670> points<00:00:45.030> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
measurements and the reference points to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970 
measurements and the reference points to
go<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.360> create<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> far<00:00:45.840> better<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
go on create a far better one as the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
go on create a far better one as the
game<00:00:47.160> came<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.719> decided<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
game came out so I just decided to this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.479 
game came out so I just decided to this
one<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> show<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
alright before I show you the actual gun

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
alright before I show you the actual gun
I<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> show<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.420> styles<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I just want to show you the styles that

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.180 
I just want to show you the styles that
we<00:00:54.809> can<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.260> evolved<00:00:55.530> from<00:00:55.680> such<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
we can see it evolved from such as the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310 
we can see it evolved from such as the
hail<00:00:56.340> through<00:00:56.579> barrel<00:00:56.850> rifle<00:00:57.030> ends<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:58.079> reach

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
hail through barrel rifle ends to reach

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.279 
hail through barrel rifle ends to reach
diiemma<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.460> both<00:00:59.789> guns<00:01:00.090> shed<00:01:00.420> pretty<00:01:01.140> much

vamp up and reach one but overall they

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.090 
vamp up and reach one but overall they
do<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.490> quite<00:01:08.640> similar<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.590> halo<00:01:10.860> 3

weapons<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.760> been<00:03:08.970> with<00:03:09.030> my<00:03:09.200> fans<00:03:10.200> on

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
weapons as I have been with my fans on

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.030 
weapons as I have been with my fans on
there<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.950> far<00:03:11.689> now<00:03:12.709> compared<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.829> hey

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
there so far now compared to the hey

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.259 
there so far now compared to the hey
move<00:03:14.220> through<00:03:14.459> better<00:03:14.609> action<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.120> can

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
move through better action you can

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.240 
move through better action you can
automatically<00:03:15.810> see<00:03:16.109> that<00:03:16.349> there<00:03:16.739> are<00:03:16.859> quite<00:03:17.190> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
automatically see that there are quite a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.550 
automatically see that there are quite a
bit<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.519> resemble<00:03:17.879> in<00:03:17.940> size

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
bit of resemble in size

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.530 
bit of resemble in size
yeah<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.769> DM<00:03:19.979> I<00:03:20.099> did<00:03:20.310> not<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.209> bridge

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
yeah the DM I did not have this bridge

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.300 
yeah the DM I did not have this bridge
at<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> top<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.260> with<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:22.979> one<00:03:23.159> they've

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
at the top and with this one they've

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.710 
at the top and with this one they've
extended<00:03:23.609> a<00:03:23.849> bit<00:03:23.879> where<00:03:24.239> now<00:03:24.359> if<00:03:24.479> you<00:03:24.569> compare

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
extended a bit where now if you compare

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.300 
extended a bit where now if you compare
this<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.049> thermos<00:03:25.440> rifle<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:25.889> looks<00:03:26.069> pretty

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
this to a thermos rifle it looks pretty

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.490 
this to a thermos rifle it looks pretty

and<00:03:38.099> the<00:03:38.970> cool<00:03:39.120> part<00:03:39.329> about<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.629> is<00:03:39.750> unlike<00:03:40.290> the

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
and the cool part about it is unlike the

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.229 
and the cool part about it is unlike the
DMR<00:03:40.680> which<00:03:40.859> was<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> single<00:03:41.430> shot<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:42.000> has

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
incorporated back to the barrel rifle

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.430 
incorporated back to the barrel rifle
balls<00:03:44.459> burst<00:03:44.819> fire<00:03:45.120> which<00:03:45.690> was<00:03:45.870> pretty<00:03:46.169> neat

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
balls burst fire which was pretty neat

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.740 
balls burst fire which was pretty neat
to<00:03:46.560> start<00:03:46.859> with<00:03:48.260> yeah<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.569> school<00:03:51.569> just

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
to start with yeah so school just

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.360

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
finally see the better rifle coming back

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.039 
finally see the better rifle coming back
I<00:03:53.519> know<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.669> missed<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.090> on<00:03:54.209> online<00:03:54.510> multiplayer

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
I know I missed it on online multiplayer

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.000 
I know I missed it on online multiplayer
the<00:03:55.949> DM<00:03:56.159> I<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.489> wasn't<00:03:56.669> like<00:03:56.909> kind<00:03:57.449> of<00:03:57.540> gun

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
the DM I just wasn't like kind of gun

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.929 
the DM I just wasn't like kind of gun
always<00:03:59.010> managed<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.340> get<00:03:59.549> shot<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.849> the<00:03:59.879> head

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
always managed to get shot in the head

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.429 
always managed to get shot in the head
so<00:04:00.239> many<00:04:00.299> times<00:04:00.449> before<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.900> could<00:04:00.959> kill<00:04:01.260> them

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
so many times before I could kill them

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.649 
so many times before I could kill them
so<00:04:01.709> having<00:04:02.099> the<00:04:02.310> burst<00:04:02.519> fire<00:04:02.639> opportunity<00:04:03.510> is

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
so having the burst fire opportunity is

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.170 
so having the burst fire opportunity is
quite<00:04:04.169> an<00:04:04.379> advantage<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.819> what<00:04:05.939> do<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.060> guys

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
quite an advantage but what do you guys

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.749 
quite an advantage but what do you guys
think<00:04:06.470> like<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.590> said<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:07.919> a<00:04:07.979> prototype<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.729> I

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:08.759 
think like I said it's a prototype so I

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:09.979 
think like I said it's a prototype so I
still<00:04:09.180> have<00:04:09.329> trying<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.629> figure<00:04:09.810> out<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
still have trying to figure out the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.539 
still have trying to figure out the
exact<00:04:10.319> measurements<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.859> build<00:04:11.040> its<00:04:11.189> my<00:04:11.310> body

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
exact measurements to build its my body

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.179 
exact measurements to build its my body
once<00:04:11.909> in<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.120> suit<00:04:12.419> so<00:04:13.109> it'd<00:04:13.349> look<00:04:13.530> nice<00:04:13.829> and

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
once in a suit so it'd look nice and

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.520 
once in a suit so it'd look nice and
look<00:04:14.759> well<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.629> I'm<00:04:15.689> just<00:04:15.870> older<00:04:16.139> still<00:04:16.349> and

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
look well so I'm just older still and

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.789 
look well so I'm just older still and
kind<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.799> spin<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.639> around<00:04:17.729> a<00:04:17.970> bit<00:04:18.529> but<00:04:19.529> it<00:04:19.620> was

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
kind of spin it around a bit but it was

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.580 
kind of spin it around a bit but it was
kind<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.099> hot

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
kind of hot

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.159 
kind of hot
with<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.340> gun<00:04:21.579> as<00:04:21.910> like<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.450> said<00:04:22.630> before<00:04:22.780> I

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
with this gun as like I said before I

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.140 
with this gun as like I said before I
only<00:04:23.650> had<00:04:23.860> about<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.250> him<00:04:24.430> just<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.730> work<00:04:24.910> from

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
only had about to him just to work from

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.300 
only had about to him just to work from
which<00:04:25.450> on<00:04:25.720> computer<00:04:26.200> were<00:04:26.350> very<00:04:26.590> small<00:04:26.889> images

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
which on computer were very small images

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.760 
which on computer were very small images
so<00:04:27.520> when<00:04:27.730> expanded<00:04:28.300> they<00:04:29.050> were<00:04:29.110> blurry<00:04:29.560> as

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
so when expanded they were blurry as

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.530 
so when expanded they were blurry as
hell<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.370> couldn't<00:04:30.700> see<00:04:30.850> enough<00:04:31.150> detail

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
hell and I couldn't see enough detail
