of cast in that slightly rubbery plastic

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.370 
of cast in that slightly rubbery plastic
not<00:02:29.910> quite<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:30.270> bad<00:02:30.450> as<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.630> classic<00:02:31.110> figures

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
not quite as bad as the classic figures

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.800 
not quite as bad as the classic figures
were<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.460> still<00:02:33.000> enough<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.540> give<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
were but still enough to give it that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.770 
were but still enough to give it that
kind<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.200> cheap<00:02:34.380> feel<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:36.090> matte<00:02:36.300> finish<00:02:36.330> on

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
kind of cheap feel the matte finish on

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.930 
kind of cheap feel the matte finish on
the<00:02:36.900> paint<00:02:37.140> also<00:02:37.940> not<00:02:38.940> my<00:02:39.209> first<00:02:39.480> choice<00:02:39.920> for

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the paint also not my first choice for

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.970 
the paint also not my first choice for
pain<00:02:41.940> application<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.720> figure<00:02:43.050> as<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.709> can

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
pain application on a figure as you can

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.830 
pain application on a figure as you can
see<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.430> kind<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.700> kind<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.060> chipping<00:02:45.720> away

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
see it is kind of kind of chipping away

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.710 
see it is kind of kind of chipping away
here<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.950> shoulder<00:02:47.340> already<00:02:47.730> but<00:02:48.300> nothing

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
here in the shoulder already but nothing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.940 
here in the shoulder already but nothing
that<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.900> can't<00:02:49.230> deal<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.410> personally

that I can't deal with personally
however<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.970> lot<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.330> collectors<00:02:51.690> may<00:02:51.930> want<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
however a lot of collectors may want to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.199 
however a lot of collectors may want to
take<00:02:52.500> note<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.890> with<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.940> being<00:02:54.120> said

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
take note of that with that being said

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.430 
take note of that with that being said
let's<00:02:54.510> go<00:02:54.630> ahead<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.870> take<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.020> look<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.750 
let's go ahead and take a look at the
articulation<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:56.250> this<00:02:56.370> guy

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760

the<00:02:57.150> feet<00:02:57.450> are<00:02:57.480> attached<00:02:58.050> with<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.970> hinge<00:02:59.970> here

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the feet are attached with a hinge here

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.420 
the feet are attached with a hinge here
in<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.050> ankle<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.739> allows<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.190> move<00:03:02.310> the

which<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.680> something<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.040> don't<00:03:20.100> see<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.970> lot

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
