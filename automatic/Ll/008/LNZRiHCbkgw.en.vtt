00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the n-word with them so don't flex on

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.340 
the n-word with them so don't flex on

the internet or front on the internet

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.630 
the internet or front on the internet
like<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.800> something<00:03:30.100> that's<00:03:30.190> normal<00:03:30.610> for

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
like this is something that's normal for

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.610 
like this is something that's normal for
you<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.600> these<00:03:31.720> are<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.990> references<00:03:32.200> these

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
you like these are the references these

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.500 
you like these are the references these
are<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:32.830> jokes<00:03:33.040> that<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.459> make<00:03:33.700> no<00:03:34.270> they're

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
are the jokes that you make no they're

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.830 
are the jokes that you make no they're
not<00:03:34.540> they<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:35.890> they<00:03:36.100> are<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:37.480> think<00:03:37.720> it's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
not they just they are and I think it's

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.560 
not they just they are and I think it's
a<00:03:37.930> bad<00:03:38.170> image<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.680> promote<00:03:39.150> whether<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.360> have

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
a bad image to promote whether you have

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.330 
a bad image to promote whether you have
a<00:03:40.600> young<00:03:40.990> audience<00:03:41.230> an<00:03:41.590> old<00:03:41.800> audience<00:03:42.190> it's

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
a young audience an old audience it's

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.000 
a young audience an old audience it's
just<00:03:42.490> not<00:03:42.850> something<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.930> we<00:03:44.080> should<00:03:44.110> cosine

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
just not something that we should cosine

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.440 
just not something that we should cosine
is<00:03:45.220> something<00:03:45.459> we<00:03:45.610> should<00:03:45.640> be<00:03:45.850> holding<00:03:46.180> each

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
is something we should be holding each

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.410 
is something we should be holding each
other<00:03:46.660> accountable<00:03:46.830> like<00:03:47.830> that's<00:03:48.070> wrong<00:03:48.420> and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
other accountable like that's wrong and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.790 
other accountable like that's wrong and
this<00:03:49.570> is<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.840> way<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.020> go<00:03:50.200> about<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.530> at<00:03:50.740> least

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
this is the way to go about it at least

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.220 
this is the way to go about it at least
is<00:03:50.980> how<00:03:51.100> i<00:03:51.130> feel<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:51.700> being<00:03:52.150> American<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:52.840> might
