lavender hill loft there are two types

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.120 
lavender hill loft there are two types
of<00:00:07.639> nesting<00:00:08.639> material<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.800> recommend<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
of nesting material that I recommend to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.450 
of nesting material that I recommend to
all<00:00:11.160> fanciers<00:00:12.590> one<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.710> those<00:00:13.889> you're<00:00:14.190> looking

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
all fanciers one of those you're looking

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.060 
all fanciers one of those you're looking
at<00:00:14.610> right<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.330> use<00:00:16.550> pine<00:00:17.550> needles<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:19.070> my

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
at right now I use pine needles in my

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.490 
at right now I use pine needles in my
individuals<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.330> put<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> nest

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
individuals I just put them in the nest

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.290

Bowl<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> birds<00:00:23.279> kind<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> fluff<00:00:24.150> them

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
Bowl and the birds kind of fluff them

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.870 
Bowl and the birds kind of fluff them
around<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:24.960> want<00:00:25.170> them<00:00:25.609> as<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.760> can

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
around the way they want them as you can

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
around the way they want them as you can
see<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.240> happen<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.810> short<00:00:28.260> needle<00:00:28.680> pine

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
see these happen to be short needle pine

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.540 
see these happen to be short needle pine
needles

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
needles

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.290 
needles
I<00:00:30.380> prefer<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.679> long<00:00:31.949> needle<00:00:32.899> pine<00:00:33.899> needles

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
I prefer the long needle pine needles

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
I prefer the long needle pine needles
for<00:00:36.300> no<00:00:36.420> other<00:00:36.570> reason<00:00:36.719> than<00:00:37.079> they're<00:00:37.620> just

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
for no other reason than they're just

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
for no other reason than they're just
longer<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> birds<00:00:38.579> seem<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.210> them

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
longer and the birds seem to like them

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
longer and the birds seem to like them
better<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> they're<00:00:40.770> no<00:00:40.890> real<00:00:41.250> difference

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
better but they're no real difference

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.180 
better but they're no real difference
between<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.000> short<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.420> along<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:43.739> second

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
between the short and along the second

type<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> nesting<00:00:44.940> material<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
type of nesting material that I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.459 
type of nesting material that I
recommend<00:00:47.090> are<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:50.250> tobacco<00:00:50.760> stems<00:00:51.469> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
recommend are or is tobacco stems the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.470 
recommend are or is tobacco stems the
reason<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.430> only<00:00:53.940> tobacco

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
reason you want to use only tobacco

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.310 
reason you want to use only tobacco
stems<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.230> pine<00:00:55.559> needles<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.059> because<00:00:57.320> they

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
stems or pine needles is is because they

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.610 
stems or pine needles is is because they
give<00:00:58.559> off<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:58.949> odor<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> pine<00:01:00.510> odor<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.350> sap

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
give off an odor the pine odor the sap

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.210 
give off an odor the pine odor the sap
or<00:01:02.090> there's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.559> chemical<00:01:04.559> naturally

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
or there's a chemical naturally

or there's a chemical naturally
occurring<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:07.640> repels<00:01:08.640> might

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
occurring in there that repels might

but that's an entirely different type of
system<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.969> highly<00:01:57.509> recommend<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.380> your

nesting material for your nasty material

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.560 
nesting material for your nasty material
to<00:02:01.649> use<00:02:01.829> either<00:02:02.100> pine<00:02:02.490> needles<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.210> tobacco

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to use either pine needles or tobacco

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
to use either pine needles or tobacco
stems<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.630> buy<00:02:06.930> tobacco<00:02:07.200> stems<00:02:07.740> from<00:02:07.979> any
