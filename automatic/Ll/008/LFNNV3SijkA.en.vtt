is for every car you own you should buy

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.470 
is for every car you own you should buy
a<00:00:12.599> repair<00:00:13.200> manual<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.730> one<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.000> for

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
a repair manual you know this one is for

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.029 
a repair manual you know this one is for
Corvettes<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.350> course<00:00:16.560> anyway<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> do<00:00:18.060> is

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
Corvettes of course anyway what to do is

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.429 
Corvettes of course anyway what to do is
to<00:00:20.039> test<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.850> knew<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> wasn't<00:00:21.840> working<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
to test it I knew it wasn't working and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.240 
to test it I knew it wasn't working and
you'd<00:00:23.220> reach<00:00:23.460> down<00:00:23.789> turn<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.980> was

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you'd reach down turn it and it was

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.970 
you'd reach down turn it and it was
gritty<00:00:26.609> grimy<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.539> basically<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.560> frozen

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
gritty grimy and basically it was frozen

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.120 
gritty grimy and basically it was frozen
so<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:29.970> shot<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.050> anyway<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> replaced<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
so it was shot so anyway I replaced it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.120 
so it was shot so anyway I replaced it
then<00:00:32.759> what<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> did<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.660> make<00:00:33.840> sure<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.920> new

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
then what I did was to make sure the new

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.080 
then what I did was to make sure the new
one<00:00:35.309> was<00:00:35.489> working<00:00:36.380> you<00:00:37.380> jumped<00:00:37.770> terminal<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.520> be

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
one was working you jumped terminal a be

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.889 
one was working you jumped terminal a be
underneath<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.800> steering<00:00:41.520> column<00:00:41.899> there's

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
underneath the steering column there's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.619 
underneath the steering column there's
you<00:00:43.829> know<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.160> jump<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.820> B<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> wire

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you know just jump a and B with a wire

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
you know just jump a and B with a wire
and<00:00:46.489> both<00:00:47.489> cooling<00:00:47.940> fans<00:00:48.300> should<00:00:48.989> come<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and both cooling fans should come on if

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
and both cooling fans should come on if
they<00:00:50.700> don't<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> do<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.160> come

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
they don't what you want to do is come

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.689 
they don't what you want to do is come
up<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> relay<00:00:55.160> here's<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> relays

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
up here to the relay here's the relays

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.470 
up here to the relay here's the relays
right<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.510> there's<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.309> my<00:01:00.149> car

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
right here there's two of them on my car

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.429 
right here there's two of them on my car
take<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.530> off<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> test<00:01:02.850> flight<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.539> see

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
take that off get a test flight and see

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
take that off get a test flight and see
if<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.710> getting<00:01:04.949> power<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.610> relay<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
if you're getting power to the relay so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.609 
if you're getting power to the relay so
you'd<00:01:06.990> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> top<00:01:07.530> touch<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.900> top<00:01:09.900> Center

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you'd want to top touch the top Center

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.690 
you'd want to top touch the top Center
and<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> get<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> light<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.460> once

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and see if you get a light and so once

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.539 
and see if you get a light and so once
you<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.470> great<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.890> means<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you do that great that means that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.469 
you do that great that means that
chances<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.840> relay<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.500> bad<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.729> then

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
chances are the relay is bad so then

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.830 
chances are the relay is bad so then
what<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.970> if<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.810> not

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
what you want to do is if you're not

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.740 
what you want to do is if you're not
getting<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.740> light<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.450> was

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
getting a light like what I was it was

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.880 
getting a light like what I was it was
dark<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.040> come<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:31.380> check<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
dark you come up here and you check the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.090 
dark you come up here and you check the
fusible<00:01:32.400> links<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.540> remove<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.470> panel

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
fusible links you remove this panel

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.980 
fusible links you remove this panel
which<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.820> simple<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.720> few

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
which is really simple it's just a few

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.130 
which is really simple it's just a few
bolts<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.369> under<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.030> ten<00:01:39.570> millimeter

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bolts and one under here ten millimeter

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.770 
bolts and one under here ten millimeter
and<00:01:40.549> don't<00:01:41.549> take<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> way<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and don't take it all the way out and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.120 
and don't take it all the way out and
then<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> panel<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.409> comes<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:44.100> out

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
then the panel just comes right out

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.870 
then the panel just comes right out
remove<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.329> battery<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.140> these<00:01:47.009> guys<00:01:47.310> right

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880

down here are the the orange ones are
the<00:01:51.479> factory<00:01:52.110> fusible<00:01:52.799> links<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.090> can

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the factory fusible links and you can

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.999 
the factory fusible links and you can
tell<00:01:54.509> when<00:01:54.720> they're<00:01:54.869> bad<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.409> does<00:01:55.649> they're

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
tell when they're bad there does they're

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.840 
tell when they're bad there does they're
just<00:01:56.250> absolutely<00:01:58.040> they'll<00:01:59.040> melt<00:01:59.460> they'll

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
just absolutely they'll melt they'll

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
just absolutely they'll melt they'll
dissolve<00:02:00.420> basically<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> blue<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.280> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
dissolve basically and the blue one is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.959 
dissolve basically and the blue one is
the<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> replaced<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.909> from

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the one I replaced and I got that from

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.210 
the one I replaced and I got that from
napa<00:02:06.420> auto<00:02:06.659> parts<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.640> i<00:02:08.670> replaced<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.509> as

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
napa auto parts and so i replaced it as

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
napa auto parts and so i replaced it as
you<00:02:11.220> saw<00:02:11.459> i<00:02:11.670> got<00:02:11.879> power<00:02:12.180> now

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you saw i got power now

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
you saw i got power now
to<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.150> relay<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.980> test<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
to the to the relay and to test it to
