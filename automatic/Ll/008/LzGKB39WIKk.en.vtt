 Y 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.430
 hello everyone welcome to negrÃ­n is yes 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.690
 you want to know how to do this manicure 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:19.290
 ruffian keep watching you will only need 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.380
 two color glazes one with a good 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.990
 coverage and top coat 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.239
 to apply the base polish we must 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 start by placing the brush in the middle 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.169
 of the nail 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 slightly away from the cuticle and 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.449
 pushing it up we get closer 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.269
 everything possible without touching it and then 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.329
 we continue the brush down of 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.120
 a normal way to paint the sides 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.040
 We do something similar by placing the brush 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.960
 more or less in the same place as before 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.690
 but making the movement down 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.100
 sideways in this way there will be a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 drawn much cleaner 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.990
 with the other color you have to cover 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.719
 we do exactly the same operation 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.490
 but a few millimeters below as if 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.520
 you imagine we have the cuticle 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.789
 in the middle of the nail the space that you leave 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.560
 to the sides and up depends on you 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.929
 you can lieutenant more or less but what 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.319
 important is how profiles the part of 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:36.369
 above that if they leave all the nails more or 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.369
 less the same space 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.970
 finally we take top coat to seal 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.970
 and standardize the design 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.780
 and our ruffian manicure is ready if
