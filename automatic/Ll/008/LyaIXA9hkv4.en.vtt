00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.650
 63 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:16.110
 The wheels before the definition is thus given for living organisms 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.079
 based on the indicated price 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:21.279
 in company between pollution is facing a problem we can not 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.300
 define what is the earth these quantities 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.480
 who doubted well compared to 2007 a season that looks worse by 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.679
 report to the investigated link 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.160
 so we have other criteria that helps us understand if the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.089
 Neanderthals was to be a subspecies species 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:37.600
 but the question is not quite straightforward 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.800
 I am rather of opinion 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.800
 to continue in some places as a separate species 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.280
 so there are several aspects on the skeleton locomotor but ultimately the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.270
 wish as author as the skull 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.280
 to bring them back to men 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.850
 presents on the list quite impressive of character 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.240
 that we find in Neanderthals and not in modern men 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.560
 so 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.040
 these relatively late 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.989
 in this sense or 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.069
 the common man who observes for example that the walls of Neanderthals 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.670
 on one side the modern manure 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.700
 will not necessarily see a difference 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.260
 but he gets down to it 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.410
 even if one undertakes brutally happy comparative anatomy work 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.800
 precise my character by character we actually did compare a whole 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.650
 together to finish Neanderthals a whole set of facts showing a man 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.150
 modern we will be able to exist a whole series of characters that we 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.610
 found in impacts in others 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.850
 all this set of characters 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.790
 percent and that not only found on the fumelois have found 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480
 same thing on the shin on the pelvis do not do as much 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.750
 it's pretty unlikely it's consistent to imagine that there is a correlation 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.840
 strong enough between all these characters especially for reasons of 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.760
 three-dimensional architecture 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.560
 and that those indicated 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.870
 a difference 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.950
 subtle enough again not necessarily noticeable the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010
 seen like that the first time 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.740
 percent between wish as author of the Neanderthals and and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.760
 modern men and eventually would soon be the author of 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.330
 Neanderthals that I have long been considered special 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.030
 share 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.509
 pr in the logic of evolution in the direction of evolution when one beats 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.619
 past eddies 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.609
 there is nothing special 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.810
 it looks a lot like what was done before in terms of skeletons 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.739
 locomotor and if a skeleton that is particular 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.499
 it's almost painful, it's more like 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.279
 somehow new to who presents some small novelties 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:27.069
 and some small adjustments 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.120
 for what differentiates us from all that has been done before term of what 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.219
 can be the promoter 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.119
 the difference is really 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.139
 between the non-green den and the fossils which is very healthy and homo 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.369
 sapiens at that it seems to have a skeleton completely lightened and 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.319
 this is also the case for the waters of the skull which are much thinner 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.089
 much more 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.359
 and they are much more scared light 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.769
 then the time with superstructures less accentuated and all that in fact 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.469
 that there really is a difference between Neanderthals 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.119
 and the frames 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 we can also watch arts-business from montreal 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.559
 so bad if the movie eure 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.209
 from the chapel to the saints 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.870
 what place did it cost 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.289
 tomorrow 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:12.399
 current 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.159
 we can not impose real world fascinates me 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.399
 the same if it is that if we see very well that it is good 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.569
 it's really compromised 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.059
 which is not the case and isere 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.969
 movies that will circulate soon minority while there it is 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.259
 really 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.419
 really triangular are not going very well that has a face 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.770
 two sides but facing austria third position 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.560
 the quina 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.919
 and it comes from the inside 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.569
 coming from a French region frames the site l'aquila 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.849
 who half a year ago 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.139
 several individuals who were as well as been searched% there are very 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.450
 a long time in the 20s 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.680
 between characters very pregnant bertagna that is to say that what is 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.899
 very interesting that the Neanderthals 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.899
 is that sometimes we find a simple treatment 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.699
 it was very very interesting that Neanderthals 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:05.889
 presented 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.889
 a hospital of character 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.609
 that they are recognizable on simple fragments 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.939
 thank you to football for example so wrong 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.939
 eneurope konÃ© du tuna is a mythical place means 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.340
 and it is found a small fragment there is no problem to recognize 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.170
 it's an amiens alert or leave no problem it's just a habit 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.759
 cracked if we have the maxillary 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.580
 so if that is 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.620
 and if the mandible so that's a shareholder who goes with the mandible 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.569
 and with that 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.939
 and we can create 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.939
 master ultra luxury 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.449
 villarreal have recomposed disappointed 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.729
 unfortunately it misses the end to that an extremely interesting part 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.789
 she wondered 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.849
 the message that wants to pass if I can afford is that still 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.539
 lr 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.619
 that is to say I think that really the discipline has evolved in a way a 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:07.569
 believing this not what you think we are I think the cause of the 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.589
 anthropological breakdown and techniques that are all set up this 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.749
 finish tic nicolas common tools they did not imagine and say that I 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.089
 believe that's really the last thing that's happened in 50 years 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:24.389
 is that we have refined and our methods with tools of yesteryear do not dream or 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.650
 for example dna other things like that we work with 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.159
 you pass and controls stuff like that it's good it's really 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.830
 to make a discipline that is evolving and sincere message that 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.800
 can do for you
