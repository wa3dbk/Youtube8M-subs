00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
and a half D but the cool thing is you

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.800 
and a half D but the cool thing is you
have<00:00:18.779> three<00:00:19.529> characters<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.510> have

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
have three characters so you can have

your warrior guy you can switch to have

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.560 
your warrior guy you can switch to have
a<00:00:24.449> wizard<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.189> he<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.699> now<00:00:27.090> remember

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
a wizard and he can like now remember

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
a wizard and he can like now remember
this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> mobile<00:00:28.199> device<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.890> been

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
this is a mobile device that's been

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is a mobile device that's been
blown<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> size<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
blown up to this to the size of a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
blown up to this to the size of a
theater<00:00:32.239> okay<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> mobile<00:00:34.140> device

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
theater okay so this is a mobile device

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.630 
theater okay so this is a mobile device
that's<00:00:34.620> been<00:00:34.800> blowing<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> size<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that's been blowing to the size of a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.170 
that's been blowing to the size of a
theater<00:00:35.969> look<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> exquisite<00:00:37.200> detail<00:00:38.180> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
theater look at the exquisite detail and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.290 
theater look at the exquisite detail and
so<00:00:39.770> they've<00:00:40.770> used<00:00:40.980> nvidia<00:00:41.579> physics<00:00:42.059> actually

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so they've used nvidia physics actually

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.080 
so they've used nvidia physics actually
in<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.950> interact<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
in this so you interact and a lot of the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910 
in this so you interact and a lot of the
puzzles<00:00:45.539> are<00:00:45.690> based<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.140> physics<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
puzzles are based on physics and you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
puzzles are based on physics and you
have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> sort<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.460> figure<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.660> different

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
have to sort of figure out different

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
have to sort of figure out different
ways<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.890> we'll<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
ways and we'll see that just up here so

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.779 
ways and we'll see that just up here so
if<00:00:51.660> i<00:00:51.719> run<00:00:51.870> inside<00:00:52.230> now<00:00:52.530> past<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
if i run inside now past the the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
if i run inside now past the the
beautiful<00:00:54.180> sort<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.480> Egyptian<00:00:55.610> statues<00:00:56.809> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
beautiful sort of Egyptian statues so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
beautiful sort of Egyptian statues so
here<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.199> puzzle<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.250> one's<00:00:59.460> fairly

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

couple times so you can choose which

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.039 
couple times so you can choose which
character<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.519> try<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
character you want so I can try and

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.960 
character you want so I can try and
reflect<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.260> beam<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> way<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
reflect this beam you're not the way the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.740 
reflect this beam you're not the way the
lighting<00:01:09.590> follows<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> beam<00:01:10.890> around<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:12.510> oh

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
lighting follows the beam around this oh

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.039 
lighting follows the beam around this oh
yeah<00:01:13.500> oh<00:01:13.740> that's<00:01:14.400> hot<00:01:14.610> yeah<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:15.869> I'm

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
yeah oh that's hot yeah so I think I'm

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
yeah oh that's hot yeah so I think I'm
actually<00:01:16.200> gonna<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.799> wizard<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
actually gonna use the wizard here and

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.230 
actually gonna use the wizard here and
I'm<00:01:17.939> gonna<00:01:18.150> grab<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.740> box<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.460> hit<00:01:20.549> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I'm gonna grab this this box and hit the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
I'm gonna grab this this box and hit the
special<00:01:21.750> key<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.830> shouldn't<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.340> able<00:01:23.520> to

of this all of this behavior is

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.770 
of this all of this behavior is
happening<00:01:56.580> with<00:01:56.670> physics<00:01:57.060> simulation<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.720> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
happening with physics simulation so you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
happening with physics simulation so you
could<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.440> could<00:01:58.620> just<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:59.070> how<00:01:59.250> heavy<00:01:59.520> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
could you could just see how heavy that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.380 
could you could just see how heavy that
rock<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:01.110> could<00:02:01.260> feel<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.240> we're

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
rock was you could feel it so now we're

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.110 
rock was you could feel it so now we're
down<00:02:03.510> in<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.780> crypt
