of a wild ride for me I wrote a good bit

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
of a wild ride for me I wrote a good bit
of<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> part<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> racing<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.109> third<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.160> I

was happy with that and then kind of

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
was happy with that and then kind of
made<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> poor<00:00:30.599> decision<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:31.109> my<00:00:31.170> part<00:00:31.289> with
