00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 so from today's video is about the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.120
 beauty you 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.830
 yes we are still in the studio of 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.450
 photos part berlin yes from marcel very 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.280
 I would be very cool equipment 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.630
 at the start and still shouting with veh 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.990
 he sees the background in the background 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.390
 rather it with what one 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.530
 Deer on the wall and we are even 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.090
 not always just built up the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.590
 location yes we were so spontaneous 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.600
 I was ultimately but always myself have 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.640
 I thought that's about cool out of this 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380
 this auxiliary pot is the armchair 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.300
 somehow make that is the wall there 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.309
 free and the maserati again 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.239
 just painted over the wall and over 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.400
 that now has a shooting location 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.769
 almost over corner looks really right 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.989
 eat the only source of light is the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.910
 beauty table the bloody city a whole 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.200
 special light characteristic yes me 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.090
 I have in the first video about the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.380
 studio photography ever shown what 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.140
 is so different light forms there 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.990
 and the beauty table is a light forma 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.950
 very often in the beauty scene and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.780
 of course also at the fashion scene 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.050
 is applied because he is such a mittelding 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.370
 is hard and soft so it is not 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.040
 really soft but it is not right 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.560
 hard but makes with cool shadow 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.600
 both in the background and on the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.730
 So model on the face and if the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.520
 beautiful comes from above, there are always horny 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.970
 shadow under the cheekbones so 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.190
 here 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 in here, and if you go far enough 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.250
 it's a bit far away 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.890
 is there so many because now 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.010
 that around here and that's how it is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.510
 a kind of vignette already in the picture inside the 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.470
 Jewish comes here a bit from 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.120
 the side too oblique from the top to the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.770
 a background on the right 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.330
 side so a bit is to illuminate 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 but far enough turned around this 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.220
 area also to illuminate and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.530
 is quasi with the middle exactly on the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.270
 Nose tip aligned with the model 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.740
 moves a bit but sees 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.450
 then still very much at the end 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.099
 interesting if so a little bit 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.810
 Shadow, there's where it's supposed to be 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.680
 that's where I think it is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.680
 looks interesting 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.710
 say times thicker 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.570
 attitudes are at one this time 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.220
 Aperture 9 and the aperture is actually 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.620
 at school photography only relevant 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.870
 for the flash so I am mine 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.950
 dazzle new in the lightning quasi of it 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.730
 currently on half power yes that's one 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.100
 walimex looks pro 400 thus 400 watts 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.230
 has this part and employee 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.510
 Closing time here currently from a 60 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 he says a sixth why I ask 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.630
 I want that a bit more 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.040
 ambient light here orders so around the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.660
 whole just not completely dark in the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.310
 to make corners which for example 160 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.020
 closing time would be the corners very much 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.820
 black and I have it in this 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.780
 At least I'm not averse to that 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.100
 I'm going to be the sixtieth 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.840
 Daylight and up there again 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.580
 The lamps light up a bit 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 the pages still the whole thing 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.700
 So little of making the image to a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.620
 a little bit lighter 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.850
 he wants to google the fairy the google 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.800
 to watch yes then you see clearly 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.360
 What I mean by the Jewish in whole 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.160
 big shadow under the cheekbone 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.610
 under the chin also a lighter 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.530
 create 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.150
 Of course we are extremely fresh out 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.320
 the background will be later 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.580
 little shade so its looks like 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.590
 sort of like one 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.850
 lighting in his pub I would 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.340
 Now it's that kind of a bit 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.160
 mixture of mysterious and yet 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.160
 soft and the Judeo in the Ghailani 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.680
 the ghailani table is that one so 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.540
 mittelweg has made soft and hard and that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.470
 works like this here is the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.660
 lightning head in there 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.940
 Here you have a huge one 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.860
 dish the light does not come through hard 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.890
 this plate just by but comes 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.660
 this is pure from behind is silver 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.860
 reflected to the outside and then to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.770
 worn outside 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.150
 So as I said mix of hard and 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.160
 soft and just makes very much 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.320
 interesting light yes friends i hope 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.850
 her something learned about the beauty jewish 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.860
 I personally think he is pretty 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.020
 but also moderately soft boxing 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.840
 cool but for this setup knew here 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.579
 I must be a bio table 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.650
 if you give thumb up 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.120
 subscribe to the channel and share the video 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.100
 with your mother and especially with you 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.100
