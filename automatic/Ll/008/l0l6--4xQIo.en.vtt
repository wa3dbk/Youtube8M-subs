00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
game it was one versus one base rate

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
game it was one versus one base rate
like<00:01:10.380> salvation<00:01:10.770> didn't<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> CC<00:01:11.640> into<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
like salvation didn't get that CC into a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.789 
like salvation didn't get that CC into a
bit<00:01:12.090> ly<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:12.990> yeah<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.439> mean<00:01:13.500> they

matter because you stuck on that way

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
matter because you stuck on that way
actual<00:01:17.070> base<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.640> mean<00:01:18.000> yeah<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.229> just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.450 
builds you don't you know you don't get
those<00:01:29.100> situations<00:01:30.229> accidentally<00:01:31.229> too<00:01:31.950> often

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
know you can build a boxy Stargate like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
know you can build a boxy Stargate like
I<00:02:06.509> said<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.409> big<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.950> cheeser

but<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.300> one<00:02:09.479> build<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.200> too

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
but this is one build that is just too

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.590 
but this is one build that is just too
tempting<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.039> ever<00:02:11.250> pass<00:02:11.550> up<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> sea

Stargate<00:02:28.320> am<00:02:28.440> probably<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.040> scout<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
Stargate am probably go so scout and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.680 
Stargate am probably go so scout and
look<00:02:29.760> around<00:02:29.850> make<00:02:30.150> sure<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.300> sense<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.600> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
look around make sure you sense it to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.590 
look around make sure you sense it to
the<00:02:30.780> right<00:02:30.870> base<00:02:31.080> but<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:33.090> close<00:02:33.300> i

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
the right base but it's really close i

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.480 
the right base but it's really close i
mean<00:02:33.750> this<00:02:33.870> by<00:02:34.290> luck<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.980> gonna<00:02:35.190> work<00:02:35.370> out

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
mean this by luck is gonna work out

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.670 
mean this by luck is gonna work out
really<00:02:35.550> nicely<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.390> doesn't<00:02:37.230> wake<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.470> better

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
really nicely the doesn't wake is better

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.790 
really nicely the doesn't wake is better
is<00:02:37.770> if<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:37.920> put<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.220> over<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.910> whatever

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
is if you put it over here but whatever

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.550 
is if you put it over here but whatever
yeah<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.700> little<00:02:41.820> bit<00:02:42.030> look<00:02:42.270> closer<00:02:42.900> the

cooler<00:02:50.310> master<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.720> actually<00:02:51.960> i<00:02:52.110> feel<00:02:52.380> this

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
cooler master this actually i feel this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.320 
cooler master this actually i feel this
is<00:02:52.590> even<00:02:52.920> stronger<00:02:53.340> coming<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.090> first

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
is even stronger coming up that first

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.300 
is even stronger coming up that first
game<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:55.320> he<00:02:55.440> saw<00:02:55.620> one<00:02:55.890> base<00:02:56.040> built

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
game because he saw one base built

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.790 
game because he saw one base built
already<00:02:56.460> he's<00:02:57.390> gotta<00:02:57.540> think<00:02:57.690> like<00:02:57.780> okay<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:58.620> it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
already he's gotta think like okay is it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.530 
already he's gotta think like okay is it
the<00:02:58.860> same<00:02:59.100> thing<00:02:59.460> cuz<00:03:00.120> normally<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> just

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
the same thing cuz normally you just

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.000 
the same thing cuz normally you just
scout<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.470> game<00:03:01.650> while<00:03:01.860> you're

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
scout this if it's game while you're

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.550 
scout this if it's game while you're
like<00:03:02.100> immediately<00:03:02.610> proxy<00:03:03.600> stargate<00:03:04.020> no

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
like immediately proxy stargate no

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.090 
like immediately proxy stargate no
question<00:03:05.180> but<00:03:06.180> because<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.470> first<00:03:07.830> game

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
question but because of the first game

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.620 
question but because of the first game
that<00:03:08.130> might<00:03:08.490> not<00:03:08.670> be<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.880> first<00:03:09.210> thing<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.540> his

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
that might not be the first thing on his

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.770 
that might not be the first thing on his
mind<00:03:10.670> turn<00:03:11.670> comes<00:03:11.880> down<00:03:12.060> by<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.270> bunkers<00:03:12.660> at

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
mind turn comes down by the bunkers at

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.140 
mind turn comes down by the bunkers at
the<00:03:12.870> front<00:03:13.140> not<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.500> mineral<00:03:13.680> lines<00:03:14.150> yeah

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the front not in the mineral lines yeah

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.540

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
this on the far left this acedia would

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.880 
this on the far left this acedia would
not<00:03:42.270> see<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.410> doesn't<00:03:43.680> matter<00:03:43.770> because
