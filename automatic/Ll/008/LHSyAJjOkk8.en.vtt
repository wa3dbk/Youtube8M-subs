touch we said the firmware update is
called<00:00:16.820> 2.1<00:00:17.820> um<00:00:19.490> although<00:00:20.490> i<00:00:21.260> would<00:00:22.260> probably

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
called 2.1 um although i would probably

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.550

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.890 
call it a two-point open three because
to<00:00:25.800> me<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.250> doesn't<00:00:26.550> deserve<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.480> called<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to me it doesn't deserve to be called to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.700 
to me it doesn't deserve to be called to
be<00:00:27.990> equated<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.349> 2.1<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.179> ads<00:00:31.170> very

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

making an update to something that

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.560 
making an update to something that
shouldn't<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.820> happened<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> first

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
shouldn't have happened in the first

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.649 
shouldn't have happened in the first
place<00:01:13.760> second<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.030> fewer<00:01:15.630> dropped<00:01:16.200> calls<00:01:16.580> I

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
place second is fewer dropped calls I

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
place second is fewer dropped calls I
personally<00:01:18.659> never<00:01:18.810> had<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.380> issues<00:01:19.860> with

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
personally never had much issues with

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.149 
personally never had much issues with
drop<00:01:20.430> calls<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> say<00:01:21.799> AT&amp;T<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.830> pretty

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
drop calls I have to say AT&amp;T is pretty

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.219 
drop calls I have to say AT&amp;T is pretty
reliable<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.850> least<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.330> area<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.990> San

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
reliable at least in my area in San

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.420 
reliable at least in my area in San
Diego<00:01:25.710> California<00:01:27.080> but<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.829> means<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Diego California but what this means is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
Diego California but what this means is
that<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.600> update<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that they will have to update the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
that they will have to update the
baseband<00:01:32.570> so<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.840> might<00:01:34.439> cause<00:01:34.650> problems

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
baseband so that might cause problems

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.990 
baseband so that might cause problems
for<00:01:35.250> jailbroken<00:01:36.090> iPhones<00:01:37.520> what<00:01:38.520> else<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.970> have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
for jailbroken iPhones what else we have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.510 
for jailbroken iPhones what else we have
a<00:01:39.950> big<00:01:40.950> Barry<00:01:41.520> improvement<00:01:42.500> hmm<00:01:43.500> heard<00:01:44.310> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
a big Barry improvement hmm heard that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.960 
a big Barry improvement hmm heard that
before<00:01:45.590> hopefully<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.829> time<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.490> real<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
before hopefully this time we for real I

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.760 
before hopefully this time we for real I
don't<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.329> we've<00:01:48.509> seen<00:01:49.130> faster<00:01:50.130> backups

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
don't know we've seen faster backups

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.560 
don't know we've seen faster backups
again<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.460> problems<00:01:54.060> with

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
again I don't have much problems with

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.200 
again I don't have much problems with
backups<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> bunch<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.700> crap<00:01:56.909> on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
backups I don't have a bunch of crap on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
backups I don't have a bunch of crap on
iphone<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> few<00:01:58.409> applications

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
iphone I just have a few applications

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.539 
iphone I just have a few applications
they<00:01:59.700> really<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.590> don't<00:02:01.920> load<00:02:02.310> my

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
they really use and I don't load my

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
they really use and I don't load my
iphones<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.090> bunch<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.899> i<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.229> use
