00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
the light utopia ray victory I think is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.550 
the light utopia ray victory I think is
what<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.000> called<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.900> pretty<00:02:45.110> weird<00:02:45.290> too

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
what it's called it's pretty weird too

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.110 
what it's called it's pretty weird too
because<00:02:45.590> all<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> ghost<00:02:46.310> rares<00:02:46.580> recently

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
because all the ghost rares recently

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.000 
because all the ghost rares recently
have<00:02:47.330> been<00:02:47.569> ultra<00:02:48.080> rare<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.319> then<00:02:48.620> ghost<00:02:48.830> rare

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
have been ultra rare and then ghost rare

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.460 
have been ultra rare and then ghost rare
I<00:02:49.130> think<00:02:49.370> utopia<00:02:50.180> ray<00:02:50.360> victory<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.019> super

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
I think utopia ray victory is a super

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.930 
I think utopia ray victory is a super
rare<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.680> goes<00:02:51.980> for<00:02:52.190> us<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.370> that's<00:02:52.549> kind<00:02:52.880> of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
rare and goes for us so that's kind of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.809 
rare and goes for us so that's kind of
weird<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.930> over<00:02:54.620> here<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.069> this<00:02:55.310> corner<00:02:55.580> we

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819
