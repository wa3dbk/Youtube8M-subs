pressure<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.530> little<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:31.890> more<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.430> mean<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
pressure a little bit more but I mean I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.050 
pressure a little bit more but I mean I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
actually had a hard time finding him

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.900 
actually had a hard time finding him
cutting<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.570> ring<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.260> so<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.590> am<00:01:38.040> what

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
cutting the ring and so on so I am what

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.840 
cutting the ring and so on so I am what
probably<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.780> he<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.530> he<00:01:40.710> didn't<00:01:41.310> run<00:01:41.490> too<00:01:41.700> much
