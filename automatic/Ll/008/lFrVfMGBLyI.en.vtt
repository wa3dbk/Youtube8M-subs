00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and we are today in a new 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.420
 jeta 5 race as you are seeing 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.770
 let's play with subscribers and the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.870
 true that I think it can be a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.000
 race for quite fun 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.120
 the map I think is very good so 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.830
 let's see if we can win it 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.830
 I love I love it when we go out like that 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.500
 endure worth it's worth that has not given me 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.619
 but it's ok that's fine 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.509
 also know 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.700
 I think there's a backflip here for 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.440
 do 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.200
 it's going to be where we're going to get stuck 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.700
 true here is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.850
 we should have taken this the other 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:46.790
 what the fuck but good we have taken 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.610

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.560
 happening this was like no 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.350
 what's left here is another 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.070
 Author 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.230

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.850

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.660
 serious 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.440
 I am going to lose 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.360
 I'm going to lose I shit on everything 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.160
 I love I love it and in the end it's that 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.570
 yes synodal I am not a character no uncle 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.820
 with how well we have done it there 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.880
 we have got ahead of everyone to the 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.680
 final but good this kills is at 20 to 30 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.360
 and it is here 50 laps we have already done 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.210
 the first one or what happened here and I 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.130
 I'm nervous here trying to know 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.830
 when when I have to sing them for 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.290
 win and this never ends 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:48.490
 to see that for my sake I want it to last 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.650
 more to be able to overtake but 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:58.290
 I want to know 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:03.659
 is worth more than the second the first 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.659
 we have already done 40 and the goal 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.850
 OK OK OK is second slouch 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.690
 but it has been the truth that very very 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.980
 exciting has been very frantic because 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.570
 I used to say oysters and the goal where 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.610
 we were already done 40 baffles I've only 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.260
 seen one at the beginning but good now 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.670
 that has been very entertaining I hope that 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.200
 you have liked to leave is for more your 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.400
 crystal you are not and see you in the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.400
 next until after
