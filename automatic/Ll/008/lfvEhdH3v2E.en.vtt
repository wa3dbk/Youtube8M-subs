00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:35.090
 it's fun to see them in fact the first 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.520
 time I come more than the content in 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.050
 the song I would answer that there are many 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.830
 people who share 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.830
 the same tastes 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:02.720
 but if not then at first because it is a 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.280
 very good family pastime can come 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.680
 can come with their children nephews 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.569
 until grandchildren and can be very 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.599
 fun here since it 's an environment 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:16.659
 drug free or anything that is 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.659
 can misinterpret the environment 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.630
 the energy if I have what they think 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:28.020
 the people that the best has a 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.020
 vision to things that are not this 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.850
 happy until this but the truth I for 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.050
 the regular and Aaron as it is a place to 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.250
 contrary to what I come here is to 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.790
 have fun to have a good time with 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.790
 all my friends 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.750
 and know because it is said that the one who does not 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.950
 knows is afraid that they are not afraid 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.690
 that come and come and that 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.510
 know this world that is a very world 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.010
 fun not mainly experience 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.380
 incredible because it 's the first time 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.040
 won something is the third time I enter 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.870
 the catwalk 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.600
 the truth is that he wins second place 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.730
 with that I feel so happy we are 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.200
 free we do not do what we 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.510
 like 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.670
 if you criticize something like that you 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.670
 having closed my favorite part 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.470
 Well, I think that the guests that bring 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.730
 be there watching 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.730
 more than anything against 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.730
 fun 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.780
 to buy manga anime 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.210
 criticize see what we do what 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.750
 we do for love more than anything is like a 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.210
 hobby and that you should not criticize the 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.310
 people in knowing them sometimes when 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.620
 that you see the contests and you say no 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.530
 no, it does not mean that I entered because 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.800
 I already sing or maybe not sing very 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.810
 Well, but I'm afraid to enter him because 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.880
 encourage you not to be the things to participate and 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.860
 have fun and well take off and you win 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.200
 impulse is an extra money that nobody 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.270
 gift is that in tastes are broken 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.979
 genres and the truth is that then all 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.960
 they say the geek calculation but it's not true 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.510
 so you are aware of everything 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.639
 type and it does not necessarily have to be 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.150
 Weird people, even if they spread you 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:14.030
 simply people who are not 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.070
 and we appreciate the anime and there are very 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:19.030
 parents who can see and buy and up 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.030
 food gives us
