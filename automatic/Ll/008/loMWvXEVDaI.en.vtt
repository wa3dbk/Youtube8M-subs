picks up sound from in front of the

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.490 
picks up sound from in front of the
capsule<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.730> rejects<00:02:01.360> ambient<00:02:01.990> sounds<00:02:02.380> from

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
capsule and rejects ambient sounds from

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.130 
capsule and rejects ambient sounds from
the<00:02:02.620> sides<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.610> hyper-cardioid<00:02:04.270> is<00:02:04.750> similar

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
the sides so a hyper-cardioid is similar

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.320 
the sides so a hyper-cardioid is similar
but<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.650> side<00:02:05.890> rejection<00:02:06.370> is<00:02:06.670> even<00:02:07.060> more

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
but the side rejection is even more

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.779 
but the side rejection is even more
pronounced<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.649> good<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.550> cuts

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
pronounced this is good because it cuts

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.059 
pronounced this is good because it cuts
down<00:02:09.879> on<00:02:10.030> unwanted<00:02:10.479> ambient<00:02:11.170> noise<00:02:11.349> but<00:02:11.980> it

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
down on unwanted ambient noise but it

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.650 
down on unwanted ambient noise but it
also<00:02:12.220> means<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.910> need<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.150> point<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.510> mic

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
also means you need to point the mic

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.420 
also means you need to point the mic
directly<00:02:14.170> at<00:02:14.260> your<00:02:14.410> subject<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.099> a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
hyper-cardioid can be less forgiving if

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.410 
come to a feature in the DSLR video kit
that<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.780> really<00:03:32.410> neat<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:33.160> sg1<00:03:33.640> mini<00:03:33.910> shotgun

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
that is really neat the sg1 mini shotgun

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.270 
that is really neat the sg1 mini shotgun
doesn't<00:03:34.720> have<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:34.840> fixed<00:03:35.140> output<00:03:35.470> cable<00:03:36.100> or
