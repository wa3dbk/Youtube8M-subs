00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
would be great but you can try to use

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
would be great but you can try to use
the<00:01:25.860> tap<00:01:26.130> water<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.299> goes<00:01:27.330> so

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
you fill the jar all the way to the top

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.020 
you fill the jar all the way to the top
with<00:01:31.650> water<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.369> i<00:01:33.329> buy<00:01:33.780> these<00:01:35.030> tops
