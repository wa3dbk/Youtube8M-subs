 Michael Hüther Director Prof and although I've caught up with a screen 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.929
 I have ever looked at everything already in the shop 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.270
 But we put it back because I'm not so sure for a long time 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.390
 but it needs to shake up 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.800
 it stays around us 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.789
 I held these drivers 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.179
 that's exactly what Nentwig Moment is 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.809
 in the East of France difficulties but use works secretly pure 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.600
 ancestry 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.550
 so liquid something but Literaturhaus Munich dry you already knew 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.430
 dwindle golden shimmer 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.310
 the waterproof the really cool scratches 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.550
 a summer I mean if you want to go for a firm swim yes and that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.740
 Out of the beach in domestic market 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740
 I mean if you make up game speed 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.680
 Wiedenfeld came across the day of biodiversity to make up machines 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.760
 Thursday 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 to parts or so and then I have even bought such a laptop caught 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.170
 Quickly that's the Faber the company logo Salier 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 burdensome 52 have never been 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.480
 that's how it looks 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 such a market is growing 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.870
 this is such a chorus rushing forward 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.350
 Beautifully beautiful summer games perform such questions 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.930
 and that wants to wear was too 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 no different 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.260
 Straw and then I have to say you're right up 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.690
 this is from Marlies Möller 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.350
 Perlak she really Weird al Attiyah 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.780
 the light night on in the heart report 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.870
 Instead of the standard pack sampling Champagne or something better 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.040
 I have to fight very interesting 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.670
 around 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.690
 that should somehow year so and glue perfect stop long 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.690
 sustained applause 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.059
 yes you see 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.659
 so that's very good for me once that's also possible to hear or listen to 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.109
 If you appreciate it mighty I'll give you that 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.729
 Show means now I can just say little to say they tried 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.639
 it was best built around her 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.139
 then another drugstore the MT 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.369
 and has more is included 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.709
 To close this chance much more the doctors sold trust 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.519
 just perfect underline 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.950
 For the fathers, I did not even know that the Steag ORF was not quoted 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.240
 "I do not have the truth in the memory of the markets 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:49.959
 more 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.339
 totally bad the vocal on both 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.599
 the sound worlds of the transmitters often provide perfect relaxation 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.719
 something once 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.719
 Leopard Pink with together 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.839
 and 12 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.639
 when I see it 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 like the St and then I have that my dad Bianca Krege probably this 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.539
 received 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.099
 she sat on 1 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.769
 i had this is about he had from here is maybe just like that 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.670
 looks 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.689
 Manless animals must also on 1 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.219
 lock us 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.219
 So she is not present from us 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:27.969
 around 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.039
 so 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:33.389
 here had imagined went as important features in the process 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:33.820
 be 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.110
 but simply Dr will suggest this to about $ 1000 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.589
 Finnish quite expensive especially for this small size are snuffed 15 liters 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.949
 to press 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.559
 He also has 15 Dieter Hoeneß 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:50.139
 Gansterer costs 15 euros so I agree for such drugstore parties 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.239
 expensive than full-time and have love 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.460
 you had to in the medium term 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.919
 yes I do with my friend a friend case 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.879
 he just fell over and believed yes I write you best no right 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.369
 that now no longer knows exactly in him before eight and a half we down ours 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:09.440
 Just video 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.709
 to make me realize I give everything 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.749
 and yes 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.180
