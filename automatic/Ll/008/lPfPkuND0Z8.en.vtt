morning I woke up and I thought I'd have
a<00:00:33.870> look<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.200> him<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> woke<00:00:36.030> up

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a look at him and this is what I woke up

a look at him and this is what I woke up
to<00:00:36.350> about<00:00:37.670> 100<00:00:38.670> percent<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> them<00:00:40.340> sprouted<00:00:41.340> as

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
to about 100 percent of them sprouted as

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.750 
to about 100 percent of them sprouted as
you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:45.629> pretty<00:00:45.899> good<00:00:46.050> one

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
you can see it that's pretty good one

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.240 
you can see it that's pretty good one
there's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> lot<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> good<00:00:48.180> ones<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:49.070> this<00:00:50.070> one

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
there's a lot of good ones here this one

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
there's a lot of good ones here this one
as<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.809> yeah<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:54.079> it's<00:00:55.079> pretty<00:00:55.199> good<00:00:55.500> success

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
as well yeah so it's pretty good success

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.479 
as well yeah so it's pretty good success
rate<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.760> expecting<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.360> UM<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.949> root<00:00:59.250> these

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
rate I was expecting to UM to root these

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.599 
rate I was expecting to UM to root these
but<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> thought<00:01:00.329> I'd<00:01:00.420> give<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.719> try<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.609> with

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
but I thought I'd give it a try and with

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.969 
but I thought I'd give it a try and with
these<00:01:02.879> ones<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.390> had<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.909> had<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.200> peach<00:01:07.200> peach

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
these ones I had I had a peach peach

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
these ones I had I had a peach peach
seed<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.700> well<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.260> thought

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
seed in there as well and so I thought

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.929 
seed in there as well and so I thought
put<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.430> happens<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
put it in there see what happens and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.340 
put it in there see what happens and
this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.930> what<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:14.750> can<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.140> these

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this is what I got can you see all these

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.760 
this is what I got can you see all these
roots<00:01:17.420> it's<00:01:18.420> yeah<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.200> looking<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.650> good

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.569 
back here I'm gonna fill it with some
seed<00:01:38.729> raising<00:01:39.090> soil<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.860> then<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.189> plant

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
seed raising soil and then just plant

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.710 
seed raising soil and then just plant
about<00:01:41.880> ten<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:44.540> no<00:01:45.540> one's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
about ten of them in one and no one's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.850 
about ten of them in one and no one's
they<00:01:45.840> survive<00:01:46.170> they're<00:01:46.380> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> survive

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
they survive they're going to survive

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.840 
they survive they're going to survive
and<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.780> ones<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.049> don't<00:01:49.430> they<00:01:50.430> want<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and the ones that don't they want and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.120 
and the ones that don't they want and
yet<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.990> I'll<00:01:52.079> plant<00:01:52.320> them<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.950> once

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
yet so I'll plant them all and then once

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.310 
yet so I'll plant them all and then once
they<00:01:53.369> start<00:01:53.820> taking<00:01:53.939> good<00:01:54.270> roots<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> they

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they start taking good roots and they

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.590 
they start taking good roots and they
sprout<00:01:55.649> I'll<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.670> move<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:57.000> individually

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
sprout I'll just move them individually

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.609 
sprout I'll just move them individually
into<00:01:57.740> separate<00:01:59.210> separate<00:02:00.210> pots<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.469> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
into separate separate pots so they can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
into separate separate pots so they can
grow<00:02:01.920> by<00:02:02.100> themselves<00:02:02.450> yeah<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
grow by themselves yeah so it's the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.139 
grow by themselves yeah so it's the
first<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.469> doing<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.189> it's

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
first time I'm doing this and it's

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.510 
first time I'm doing this and it's
pretty<00:02:06.479> good<00:02:07.069> I<00:02:08.360> searched<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> YouTube<00:02:10.520> no
