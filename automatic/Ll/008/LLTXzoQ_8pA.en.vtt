00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.569
 And then folks, it's good that the person who spoke edu 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.639
 and next galera in today's video I'm 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 bringing you here from control 2 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.740
 a game of black ops 2 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.190
 It's a game that I played well in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.400
 for this map your very large map will not 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.740
 had a lot of knowledge I did not have so much fluidity 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 of gameplay was one more gameplay 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 rhythm but finally the final result 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.570
 It was good, I hope you like this. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.180
 departure but not from the start and 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 black ops 2 I would like to talk to you 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.649
 in this video here and wanted to chat 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.680
 with you about the beta of 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.899
 colloquium green black ops 3 is do 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.559
 for a long time he does not have a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.350
 our audience was difficult. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.360
 talk that open beta but anyway 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 the last time the multiplayer of the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 Bantam colloquium was available in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.340
 beta was in the world at war that was 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 in 2008 people have been opened that time 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.850
 was available for 360 xbox 360 and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.470
 for the pc was not available for the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.900
 Playstation 3 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.049
 the beta version of black ops 3 will be 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 available first on playstation 4 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.240
 then it will open to the pc and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.500
 also for xbox the year and is not known 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.369
 still whether it will be available for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 and finally what I think ect I see that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 it's worse than they're trying to do with this 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.530
 the black ops beta 3 because the beta 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.799
 she will be available to anyone who does 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.320
 The worst pain in the game, so I see it. 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.180
 as a way of encouraging 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.579
 people to pre-sell on that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 pre-purchase situation I do not know how to 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.450
 It is better to say that people 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.950
 make the worst pain of the black ops three then 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.759
 is an incentive to sell the game but 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.030
 more than this is a way of you 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.000
 promote the game because you are open by opening 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 on August 19th, many people will do 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.299
 streaming 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 A lot of people are going to make the video of the version 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.330
 beta then who drives will use this 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.470
 for promotion but to be a way of 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.530
 marketing 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 we need to have a good game because 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.160
 This game is bad, it's going to be negative. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.470
 I was told of the game so I think 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.940
 presence of the beta is a sign of 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.430
 What is it that I see you to train that 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.730
 are very confident that the game will 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.140
 be welcomed by the public that will 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.760
 be a good game and obviously if they 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.380
 they want to bring it to know they are public 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.900
 want to do some tests that I 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.940
 I imagine they will test the number 11 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.760
 connection 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.010
 in a game like call of the union is 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.670
 essential that the connection is very good 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.660
 an online game that does not require 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.940
 action reaction rate and 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.510
 connection helps but not so important 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.209
 high-speed games like 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.959
 are the shooting games then connection goes 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.570
 very good weight with this component 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.220
 comes the part of detection network of 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:20.850
 detection of hits of the engine of the game 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.600
 understand when a shot is given and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.540
 the opponent, and there is also a 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.180
 an extremely complicated factor in 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.700
 people very much complain that compensation of 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.260
 legg legg compensation she is 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.239
 present in any shooting game on 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.810
 line and it makes the game more 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.700
 fluid because what you see on your screen 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.010
 It's not what's happening in the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.019
 reality what you see on your screen it 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.910
 is being altered by the 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.650
 online game that goes automatically 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.500
 generating the images according to which 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.269
 you receive information not with what 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.510
 is happening because what you get 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:08.310
 has a delay of yesterday 6 on he tries 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.799
 compensate for the delay oleg that is part 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.380
 of any online experience a good 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.019
 fan convince sean and he is very good 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.709
 he does it with his experience 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.590
 online is very very fluid and a 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.910
 fan with good is bad 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.120
 it makes your experience 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.460
 horrible because that's the one you throw 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.139
 take the opponent and you fall dead is the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.970
 Dude, take it out on you, you protect yourself. 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.560
 You protected falls dead 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.060
 This is a compensation 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.699
 is running right 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.070
 only you have an example of game with light 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.520
 compensation that was horrible 1983 way 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.010
 it was really bad really bad 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.010
 a game that had an excellent connection 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.780
 but it was horrible to play if not 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.500
 had close to the face promotes today 22 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.770
 who did not have so much to convince him to be 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.500
 then the connection was the purest but 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.660
 suffered who was not with a host 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.979
 I suffered with a delay anyway I'm not 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.919
 expert on this but it's good you 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:10.919
 understand these aspects and is open to 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.639
 I think as I said it is a way of 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.530
 test the game a game that boots cifec 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.110
 is very well done because otherwise 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.300
 nobody would expose the game online and something 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.660
 essential in this open professor doctor 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.660
 and what are they analyzing to pull the 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.050
 statistics and see which areas 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.510
 are being used the most in less used 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.820
 most commonly used weapon indicates a 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.430
 weapon that is very strong - used a 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.039
 gun that is very weak 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.110
 they will see with the guns they take more than 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.750
 the less that the better than the one in the stretch 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.840
 All this to be able to balance the force 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.720
 of weapons they will test the pigs they 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.760
 they are going to test data 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.620
 moving the characters on the map 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.690
 see where the characters are the players 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.470
 they are staying less to see if they have 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.610
 something in imbalance in the game and 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.190
 can expect from the open that there is a ceiling 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.800
 level, for example if the 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.900
 prestige in the game for level 60 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.229
 you'll get to seal the level 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.900
 20 in the beta and I do not know if the version 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.919
 final has 30 50 guns beta version goes 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.580
 ter 10 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:25.169
 So I'll have a lot of restriction on the 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.300
 beta in relation to the final version of the game 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.330
 even in relation to maps, people do not 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.240
 will see lots of maps in the game but I'm 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.870
 excited about the beta will be 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.909
 fun and anyway that's what I hope 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.480
 I liked the video, I did not go in 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.360
 one 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.380
 in-depth hack them and 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.880
 depth 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.380
 but I got into no depth at all 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.570
 aspect but I wanted to give a 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.910
 ample for you regarding beta 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.730
 Anyway, I'm going to stay here. 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.730
 That's good, said the
