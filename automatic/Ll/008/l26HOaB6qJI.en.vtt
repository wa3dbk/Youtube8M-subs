00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.809 
where I think a class action is quite
frankly<00:04:37.389> inappropriate<00:04:38.259> or<00:04:38.710> at<00:04:39.280> least<00:04:39.639> it

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
frankly inappropriate or at least it

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.089 
frankly inappropriate or at least it
should<00:04:40.000> be<00:04:40.120> a<00:04:40.150> lot<00:04:40.449> more<00:04:40.750> money<00:04:41.050> we<00:04:41.889> haven't
