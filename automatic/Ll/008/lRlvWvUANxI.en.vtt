got here I quite like that so what I can

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.780 
got here I quite like that so what I can
also<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.630> if<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.650> select<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> reason

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
also do it is if you select you a reason

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.990 
also do it is if you select you a reason
to<00:03:38.820> put<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.870> still<00:03:40.080> selected<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.590> black<00:03:40.920> as<00:03:41.760> you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
to put it still selected on black as you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.699 
to put it still selected on black as you
can<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.360> if<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.690> put<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:42.959> over<00:03:43.050> these<00:03:43.290> windows

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
can see if I put it over these windows

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.800 
can see if I put it over these windows
then<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:45.000> will<00:03:45.209> actually<00:03:45.420> add<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
then it will actually add the the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.940 
then it will actually add the the
Gaussian<00:03:49.320> blur<00:03:49.770> effect<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.490> if<00:03:51.330> i<00:03:51.950> change

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
Gaussian blur effect to it if i change

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.660 
Gaussian blur effect to it if i change
that<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.459> wait<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:55.260> makes<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.070> shut<00:03:56.310> up<00:03:56.400> again

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
that to wait it makes it shut up again

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.930 
that to wait it makes it shut up again
so<00:03:57.480> what<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.720> want<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.990> do<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.410> make<00:03:58.940> the
