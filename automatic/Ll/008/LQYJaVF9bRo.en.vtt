00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
era now the neat thing about these fobs

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.270 
era now the neat thing about these fobs
is<00:00:50.129> they're<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:50.910> durable<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.750> tough

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
is they're really durable really tough

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.750 
is they're really durable really tough
but<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.640> break<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.440> say<00:00:55.440> maybe<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but if you do break one say maybe you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.369 
but if you do break one say maybe you
shoot<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.780> ends<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.170> looking

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
shoot it and it ends up looking

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.569 
shoot it and it ends up looking
something<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.890> that<00:01:00.920> they'll<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:02.250> shoot

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
something like that they'll still shoot

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.210 
something like that they'll still shoot
and<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.239> prove<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:04.350> gonna<00:01:04.619> film<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and to prove that I'm gonna film a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.990 
and to prove that I'm gonna film a
little<00:01:06.090> later<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.369> even<00:01:08.549> trim<00:01:08.880> them

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
little later and you can even trim them

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.920 
little later and you can even trim them
down<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.650> make<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.340> look<00:01:11.720> something<00:01:12.720> like

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
down and make them look something like

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.789 
down and make them look something like
that<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> they'll<00:01:14.970> still<00:01:15.240> fly<00:01:15.799> relatively

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that and they'll still fly relatively
