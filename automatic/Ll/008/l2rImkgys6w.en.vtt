which<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:10.950> refer<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.309> as<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.639> gully<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.090> right

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
which we refer to as a gully is right

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.629 
which we refer to as a gully is right
about<00:00:12.900> 3/8<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.469> an<00:00:13.590> inch<00:00:13.679> that's<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.400> want

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
about 3/8 of an inch that's what we want

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.160 
about 3/8 of an inch that's what we want
so<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> good<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.750> all<00:00:15.870> we're<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.109> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
so this is good it's all we're going to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
so this is good it's all we're going to
need<00:00:16.320> well<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
need well not really what I have a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.420 
need well not really what I have a
problem<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> fact<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.890> these<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.130> so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
problem with the fact that these are so

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.029 
problem with the fact that these are so
thin<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.029> narrow<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:22.289> I'd<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.890> be

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
thin so narrow what I'd like to do is be

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.550 
thin so narrow what I'd like to do is be
from<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.150> additional<00:00:24.810> strip<00:00:25.109> because

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
from up with an additional strip because

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
from up with an additional strip because
we<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.189> less<00:00:26.400> chance<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> carpet<00:00:27.330> failure

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
we have less chance of carpet failure

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.730 
we have less chance of carpet failure
send<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.410> down<00:00:29.900> now<00:00:30.900> Carlos<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.500> putting

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
send them down now Carlos is putting

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.860 
send them down now Carlos is putting
down<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> adhesive<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> pad<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.630> it's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
down the adhesive for the pad and it's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.950 
down the adhesive for the pad and it's
very<00:00:34.050> important<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> seams<00:00:35.340> as<00:00:35.550> well

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
very important to do the seams as well

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
very important to do the seams as well
obviously<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.380> don't<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.920> separating

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
obviously we don't want them separating

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.619 
obviously we don't want them separating
we<00:00:38.670> don't<00:00:38.820> want<00:00:38.940> any<00:00:39.059> shifting<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> sees

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
we don't want any shifting at the sees

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
we don't want any shifting at the sees
this<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.559> insurance<00:00:43.680> policy<00:00:44.270> what

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this is a little insurance policy what

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270 
this is a little insurance policy what
we're<00:00:45.390> doing<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:45.750> rolling<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.590> we're

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
we're doing is just rolling it out we're

we're doing is just rolling it out we're
going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> put<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.820> position<00:00:48.170> fold<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.320> upon

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
going to put it in position fold it upon

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.639 
going to put it in position fold it upon
itself<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> easier<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> handle<00:00:53.390> so

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
itself to make it easier to handle so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
why aren't you cutting all the way

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.590 
why aren't you cutting all the way

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
pressure keeping the knife straight we

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.200 
pressure keeping the knife straight we
don't<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:42.930> any<00:01:43.110> angle<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> edge<00:01:44.009> ok<00:01:44.909> so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
don't want any angle to the edge ok so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.810 
don't want any angle to the edge ok so
as<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.920> we<00:01:46.920> create<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.460> perfect<00:01:47.790> see<00:01:48.450> edge

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
as we go we create this perfect see edge

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.249 
as we go we create this perfect see edge
before<00:01:50.820> seeing<00:01:51.000> construction<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.840> need<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
before seeing construction we need to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.260 
before seeing construction we need to
apply<00:01:52.649> latex<00:01:53.100> seam<00:01:53.399> sealer<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> assure<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
apply latex seam sealer to assure that

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
apply latex seam sealer to assure that
the<00:01:54.570> backings<00:01:55.049> will<00:01:55.560> stay<00:01:55.770> together<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.369> will

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the backings will stay together and will

the backings will stay together and will
not<00:01:56.700> separate<00:01:57.320> ok<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.799> seam<00:01:59.009> sealer

not separate ok now that the seam sealer
is<00:01:59.520> dried<00:01:59.790> we're<00:02:00.360> ready<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> construct<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
is dried we're ready to construct the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.810 
is dried we're ready to construct the
scene<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.979> line<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.399> make<00:02:02.670> sure

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
scene we line it up make sure

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.880 
scene we line it up make sure
everything's<00:02:03.240> even<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> seam

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
everything's even then we put the seam

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.540 
everything's even then we put the seam
tape<00:02:05.250> underneath<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:07.099> Center<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
tape underneath and Center it on the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.999 
tape underneath and Center it on the
scene<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.090> heat<00:02:09.750> activated<00:02:10.349> he's<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.950> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
scene it's heat activated he's going to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.350 
scene it's heat activated he's going to
take<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> seam<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.670> iron

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
take a seam and iron

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.530 
take a seam and iron
and<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.860> tape<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:15.030> activates

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and I on that tape and that activates

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.170 
and I on that tape and that activates
the<00:02:15.780> adhesive<00:02:16.020> which<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:16.980> turn<00:02:17.180> goes

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
the adhesive which then in turn goes

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.840 
the adhesive which then in turn goes
into<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> backing<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.200> carpet<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:20.730> we

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
into the backing of the carpet what we

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.630 
into the backing of the carpet what we
normally<00:02:21.210> do<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.920> up<00:02:23.040> close<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.520> it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
normally do is just get up close to it

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280 
normally do is just get up close to it
and<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:23.910> I'm<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.240> stretching<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.900> I'm<00:02:25.110> just

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and now I'm not stretching this I'm just

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410 
and now I'm not stretching this I'm just
hooking<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.220> pins<00:02:26.460> because<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.210> tool

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
hooking it on the pins because this tool

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.270 
hooking it on the pins because this tool
is<00:02:27.660> made<00:02:27.960> for<00:02:28.230> positioning<00:02:28.800> not<00:02:28.980> for

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
is made for positioning not for

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.120 
is made for positioning not for
stretching<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:30.840> give<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.890> slight

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
stretching so we just give it a slight

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.180 
stretching so we just give it a slight
tap<00:02:32.720> holding<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> onto<00:02:34.110> pins<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.740> tack

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
strip making sure that we we've

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.080

penetrated<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.610> back<00:02:39.920> next<00:02:40.920> we<00:02:41.070> take<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
penetrated the back next we take this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.180 
penetrated the back next we take this
chisel<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:42.720> tool<00:02:43.140> which<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.680> called<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.950> stair

make sure that we're connected here that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.640 
make sure that we're connected here that
really<00:02:51.750> gets<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.990> down<00:02:52.110> out<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> tack

really gets it down out of the tack

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.310 
really gets it down out of the tack
strip<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:53.760> want<00:02:54.060> those<00:02:54.240> pins<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.750> be<00:02:54.870> up<00:02:55.020> into

coming in the other direction so what I

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.630 
coming in the other direction so what I
would<00:03:05.310> first<00:03:05.550> do<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.030> make<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.690> diagonal

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
would first do is make a diagonal

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
got some sort of a sled right here our

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.880 
got some sort of a sled right here our
fence<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.840> actually<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.320> against<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.740> wall

would hold tight up against the wall and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.509 
would hold tight up against the wall and
you're<00:03:19.200> going<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.380> keep<00:03:19.530> pressure<00:03:19.890> here<00:03:20.370> as

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
you're going to keep pressure here as

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.750 
you're going to keep pressure here as
you're<00:03:21.090> pushing<00:03:21.450> along<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.860> blade<00:03:23.489> will

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
you're pushing along and that blade will

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.060 
you're pushing along and that blade will
be<00:03:23.790> doing<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.360> cutting<00:03:24.600> for<00:03:24.959> us<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:26.040> just

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
be doing the cutting for us so we just

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.690 
be doing the cutting for us so we just
move<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.820> right<00:03:26.970> along<00:03:27.860> make<00:03:28.860> sure<00:03:29.100> work<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.550> it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
move it right along make sure work of it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.320 
move it right along make sure work of it
right<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:31.019> how<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.380> treat<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.610> sort<00:03:33.269> of

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
right so how do you treat this sort of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.890 
right so how do you treat this sort of
rough<00:03:33.600> edge<00:03:33.810> right<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.390> use<00:03:36.390> my<00:03:36.840> knee

that going okay what we're doing now is
moving<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.019> power<00:03:52.170> stretcher<00:03:52.560> into<00:03:52.739> position

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
moving the power stretcher into position

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.259 
moving the power stretcher into position
so<00:03:53.550> powerstretch<00:03:54.269> how<00:03:54.690> does<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:54.900> thing<00:03:54.959> work

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
so powerstretch how does this thing work

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.270 
so powerstretch how does this thing work
what<00:03:57.269> we<00:03:57.390> have<00:03:57.630> here<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.380> heel<00:03:58.769> up<00:03:59.010> against

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
what we have here is a heel up against

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.040 
what we have here is a heel up against
that<00:03:59.459> wall<00:03:59.640> we<00:03:59.850> just<00:04:00.090> secured<00:04:00.450> caps<00:04:00.900> are

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
that wall we just secured caps are

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.780 
that wall we just secured caps are
braced<00:04:01.260> up<00:04:01.470> against<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.830> firewall<00:04:02.310> right

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
braced up against the firewall right

braced up against the firewall right
bunch<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.300> tubes<00:04:03.540> holes<00:04:04.200> here<00:04:04.590> for<00:04:04.620> adjustment

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
bunch of tubes holes here for adjustment

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.880

correct<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:07.050> have<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.200> ratcheting<00:04:07.650> tube

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
correct and we have a ratcheting tube

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.190 
correct and we have a ratcheting tube
that<00:04:08.370> allows<00:04:08.700> for<00:04:08.940> easier<00:04:09.269> motion<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.049> in

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
that allows for easier motion and in

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.620 
that allows for easier motion and in
this<00:04:10.290> end<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:11.070> end<00:04:11.280> here<00:04:11.640> what<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.600> have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
this end and this end here what we have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.909 
this end and this end here what we have
is<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.519> head<00:04:14.519> with<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.030> teeth<00:04:15.269> similar<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.530> the
