the<00:03:09.170> voltage<00:03:10.170> regulator<00:03:10.590> locks<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.150> this

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
the voltage regulator locks so for this

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.350 
the voltage regulator locks so for this
just<00:03:12.870> take<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.110> pads<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.340> scissor<00:03:14.580> and

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
this one but you also need to cool these

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.930 
this one but you also need to cool these
they're<00:03:59.470> here<00:04:00.390> take<00:04:01.390> another<00:04:01.659> piece

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
right now we can take the cooler and the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.760 
right now we can take the cooler and the
good<00:04:09.920> thing<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.570> we<00:04:11.570> have<00:04:11.780> this<00:04:11.810> hole<00:04:12.290> here<00:04:12.320> and

good thing is we have this hole here and

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.370 
good thing is we have this hole here and
it<00:04:13.130> fits<00:04:13.580> exactly<00:04:14.110> on<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:16.160> one<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.810> that's

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
it fits exactly on this one so that's

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:28.330 
it fits exactly on this one so that's
very<00:04:18.650> easy<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.489> position

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:39.860 

I<00:04:29.570> can't<00:04:30.570> move<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.930> see<00:04:36.350> put<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.700> on<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:39.660> side

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
I can't move it see put it on the side

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.440 
I can't move it see put it on the side
of<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.110> table<00:04:40.290> because<00:04:41.280> with<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.700> PCI<00:04:42.000> slots

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
of the table because with the PCI slots

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.140 
of the table because with the PCI slots
you<00:04:42.660> can<00:04:42.780> put<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.320> directly<00:04:43.620> on<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.100> table<00:04:47.150> you

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
you can put it directly on the table you

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.879 
you can put it directly on the table you
take<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.480> screws
