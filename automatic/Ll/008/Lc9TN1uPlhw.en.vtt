today we are going to prepare and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.860 
today we are going to prepare and
examine<00:00:04.740> animal<00:00:05.430> cheek<00:00:05.670> cells<00:00:06.000> using<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.690> light

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
examine animal cheek cells using a light

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.480
