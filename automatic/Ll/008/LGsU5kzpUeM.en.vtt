with the utes sr tank so the Soviet

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.410 
with the utes sr tank so the Soviet
Union<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.430> German<00:02:07.430> tanks<00:02:07.729> are<00:02:07.909> going<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.300> be

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
Union and German tanks are going to be

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.210 
Union and German tanks are going to be
at<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.989> launch<00:02:09.170> date<00:02:09.410> available<00:02:09.860> for<00:02:10.069> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
at the launch date available for the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.460 
at the launch date available for the
players<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.970> go<00:02:11.090> through<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.260> same

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
players and to go through it's the same

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.140 
players and to go through it's the same
principle<00:02:12.950> as<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.310> World<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.580> Tanks<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.090> you

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
principle as in World of Tanks so you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.080 
principle as in World of Tanks so you
just<00:02:14.569> have<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> tank<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:16.550> moment<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:16.850> just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
just have a tank and the moment you just

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.970 
just have a tank and the moment you just
research<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.750> get<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:17.989> on<00:02:18.080> stock<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.739> first

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
research it you get it on stock so first

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.470 
research it you get it on stock so first
you<00:02:19.130> have<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> research<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.850> new<00:02:20.000> modules

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you have to research the new modules

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.860 
you have to research the new modules
like<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:22.160> next<00:02:22.400> turret<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.720> also

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
like the next turret and you can also

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.660 
like the next turret and you can also
see<00:02:24.019> like<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.500> differences<00:02:25.130> better

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
see like the differences better

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.970 
see like the differences better
protection<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.510> menu<00:02:26.780> ability<00:02:27.110> impact<00:02:27.739> which

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
protection and menu ability impact which

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.890 
protection and menu ability impact which
will<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.459> in<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:29.060> moment<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.420> install<00:02:29.750> it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
will have in the moment you install it

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.660 
will have in the moment you install it
you<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.620> mount<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.160> then<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
you can just mount and then all the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.910 
you can just mount and then all the
stats<00:02:32.030> are<00:02:32.209> switching<00:02:32.630> if<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.470> need<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> more

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
stats are switching if you need a more

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250 
stats are switching if you need a more
in-depth<00:02:34.430> detail<00:02:34.910> overview<00:02:35.600> regarding<00:02:36.080> this

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
in-depth detail overview regarding this

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.290 
in-depth detail overview regarding this
you<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.709> just<00:02:36.950> skip<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.610> then<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
you can just skip it and then you can

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.750 
you can just skip it and then you can
see<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.720> difference<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.920> your<00:02:40.069> prior<00:02:40.310> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
see the difference like to your prior to
