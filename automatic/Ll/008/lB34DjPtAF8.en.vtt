00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 gentlemen this is a game indeed 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.160
 rotten but brand in the literal sense 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.730
 I would not have in other epithets for 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.230
 I do not describe this rot 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.410
 see career because a break of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.039
 unprecedented maroni because who 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.619
 forced to make a harrowing tutorial 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 dc maybe let me hear the tutorial I have 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.539
 understood achieved let me do some 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.690
 missions instead you don't have to do it and you owe yourself 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.649
 tearing the chestnuts we avoid like the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.270
 death 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.129
 Let us but there is a way and garetto 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.780
 scrim the highway so the vehicles 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 we have this standard vehicles 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 unfortunately only this until you go 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.539
 ahead with the vehicle career in the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.109
 pool to see with this but ok we leave 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:04.170
 all the same all equal 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:07.049
 I don't remember the buttons on the controller yes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.689
 traffic starts with great voracity 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.600
 that rages on the region in a manner 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.150
 really forcing the control of it 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.190
 this brutally goes 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.200
 let's see how you shoot I would shoot 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:30.980
 of the bomb to avoid traffic is one 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:33.500
 something not so easy then commercial 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.740
 decided by the usual there are beings 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.740
 standard humans who break your chestnuts 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.850
 in the sense that they are not avoided 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.320
 in front of this power they stay there 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.950
 dazed and is one of the things most 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.130
 heartbreaking that can occur 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:58.010
 making you cause accidents 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.910

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.430

 have a little nitro and download a 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.340
