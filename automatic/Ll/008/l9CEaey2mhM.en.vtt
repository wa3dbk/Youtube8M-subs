00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I welcome all fans of Skyrim with you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.220
 crypt today we have a review on the mod which 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 called mono tanks as its current 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.210
 it is not clear what is translated 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.119
 the essence of this mod mod increases the size 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.400
 chest depending on the current 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.960
 amount of magic in a character 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.510
 example, as we see now the maximum 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.510
 breast size which is customized by plugin 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.700
 here the camera will not work 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:40.010
 set aside to publish magic so look 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:44.010
 that's how we use magic 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.829
 see the magic gets in the way of zero and size 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.829
 chest and falls more accurately tends to zero 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.379
 here and gradually how to recover 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.309
 magicians restored our chest 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.309
 female character 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.610
 the moment the place is warmer sideboards without 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.080
 support 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 chest physics plus top costs havok 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 besides havok and also used skeleton 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.940
 max script he xp 32 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 in general, everything you need is on the site 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.250
 to download everything you also need 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.250
 there will be links in the description below the video 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 among other things by itself 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.620
 need to install sky ui for 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.820
 mod settings this mod also 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.350
 supports setting via skype and 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.870
 Now in the general window, go over 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.460
 details see something at all in this 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:53.750
 there are many she tanks 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.750
 so we look 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.659
 so select powerbar magica hell stamina 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.990
 In general, that is, the chip can be switched 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.700
 in depending on what specifically 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.640
 figure we will change the size 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.380
 default chest static is magic 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 You can put a deuce it will be 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.989
 health appropriately if healthy 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.100
 character falls falls breast size and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.020
 the third is stamina stamina this 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.030
 stamina can be put on 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.470
 endurance if you don't play for example 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.690
 don't use magic for a magician 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.610
 chip so the next figure is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.930
 update interval is at what interval 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.050
 will occur directly 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.830
 increase and decrease as we see here 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.830
 by description 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.320
 the lower this figure the more 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.070
 loading your computer tapes 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.980
 here you can pick up 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.680
 suitable interval depending 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.050
 on how your principle works 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.040
 process as it processes the skeleton and 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.459
 here is an increase or decrease in breast 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.620
 so here that I do not know the description here 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.079
 what is three but knows max power of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.040
 all sites of 6 also fuck knows what 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.709
 means but not the essence of the new brilliance and 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.239
 fucking bss meme but that minimum 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.860
 size that can be set for 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.350
 Breasts I mean how much do we have 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.650
 breast size will fall depending on 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.989
 In addition, when the health indicator is introduced 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.280
 asti or mana drops to zero and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.030
 max size 3 hurried mixes with 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.049
 leading 2 and 2 here what is not at all 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.400
 naturally you can put 16 so here 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.440
 jokes so kurly kurly min cur you max 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.829
 we put mono cloths on canvases on 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.019
 full 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:56.310
 well this is for some course nikkor af not in 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.769
 In terms of curses in terms of I do not know fuck 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.890
 discover 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.459
 seriously nothing is it here now 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:12.150
 reduce the maximum size 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:13.590
 breast which may be new 5 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.040
 we leave we see it all gradually 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:21.109
 decreases went mana recovery and 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.109
 breast restoration has gone 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:35.020
 principle mate can only conflict 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.780
 with similar mods that are changing 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.660
 chest depending on some conditions 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.490
 I mean, fashion can start to conflict 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.730
 if you nothing down but it 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.570
 no conflicts principle be 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.250
 should by itself that's the only thing 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.820
 a requirement is availability 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.130
 skeleton skeleton with support 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.470
 breast change her again if you want 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.760
 so that in my clothes it all showed up 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:07.480
 clothes should also support the chest 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.610
 different sizes at the moment place 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.030
 like this new year's gear I do not run 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.740
 here already on 3 different sets 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.980
 all this is on the site well let's for the sake of 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:27.300
 Interest right now , let's go and try with us 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:32.950
 so not here mod settings 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.810
 for example endurance troika take so 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.090
 now our breasts should be changing in 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.590
 depending on endurance mono influences 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:45.280
 Should not try to land mana 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:49.360
 we see a chest like we had and 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.570
 Baba left to pour corn boobs 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.010
 called on the belly so let's try 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.880
 go running for us 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.880
 imposed on 0 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.370
 sprint ahead will not work therefore 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.669
 we can only see change when 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.979
 we have imposed will fall to zero and and 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:15.069
 principle let's turn here fell look 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:19.099
 All endured seppala Baba we became 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:22.550
 plywood and how to see as soon as we have 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:26.629
 there is a recovery of stamina chest 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.139
 grows here is a fashion principle can be 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:33.370
 say comic to some kind of gameplay 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.740
 use in it or practical 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.509
 no, no, you can say so by 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.990
 your wolf also attacked 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.990
 it's time to dump 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:52.740
 For the mod to work, you will need to go though 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.599
 least once in the sky ui settings menu of 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.419
 as you all connected anchor install 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:07:00.210
 mod need to be at least once to go to 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:03.599
 sky ui setup menu and could start 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.789
 work that's all basically here 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:11.210
 no more trouble problems 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.210
 should not be 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.659
 let's we look for sizes so that one 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.659
 interesting and again letters 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:26.150
 so try the maximum 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:33.050
 up to some unreal sizes 40 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.560
 here it is very noticeable as we 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:48.290
 grow milkings depending on 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:51.320
 recovering up to such cruel and 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.320
 unreal sizes 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.400
 In principle, everything here is such a look if 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:06.300
 do you like it you can download it on 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:08.490
 site to use your goals with you 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.180
 there was a crypt everyone thanks for watching and 

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.180
 bye everyone
