00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139 

III<00:00:00.390> think<00:00:00.630> first<00:00:01.079> of<00:00:01.230> all<00:00:01.410> that<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:02.550> excited

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
III think first of all that I'm excited

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.970 
III think first of all that I'm excited
about<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.570> idea<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:04.020> we<00:00:04.259> have<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> playoff

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
about the idea that we have a playoff

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.440 
about the idea that we have a playoff
system<00:00:05.250> where<00:00:05.670> we're<00:00:05.819> going<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.000> have<00:00:06.150> four

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
system where we're going to have four

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.660 
system where we're going to have four
teams<00:00:06.720> involved<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.470> playoff<00:00:07.740> system<00:00:08.130> I

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
teams involved in that playoff system I

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.180 
teams involved in that playoff system I
think<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> fans<00:00:09.870> are<00:00:10.080> excited<00:00:10.380> about<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.980> I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
think the fans are excited about it I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.499 
think the fans are excited about it I
hope<00:00:11.429> I'm<00:00:11.730> hopeful<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.440> we<00:00:13.440> use<00:00:13.650> some<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
hope I'm hopeful that we use some of the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.900 
hope I'm hopeful that we use some of the
BCS<00:00:15.509> criteria<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.440> they<00:00:17.100> used<00:00:17.460> over<00:00:17.880> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
BCS criteria that they used over a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.420 
BCS criteria that they used over a
13-year<00:00:18.390> period<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> knowledge<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
13-year period the knowledge and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.269 
13-year period the knowledge and
experience<00:00:20.990> that<00:00:21.990> they<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:23.070> usually

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
experience that they have they usually

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.700 
experience that they have they usually
got<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.850> right<00:00:24.060> where<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.570> got<00:00:24.720> confused<00:00:25.350> or

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
got it right where they got confused or

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.009 
got it right where they got confused or
when<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.039> got<00:00:26.359> criticized<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:27.900> there

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
when they got criticized was when there

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.290 
when they got criticized was when there
were<00:00:28.109> more<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.470> two<00:00:28.619> teams<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.369> were

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
were more than two teams that were

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.720 
were more than two teams that were
capable<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.869> getting<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:32.369> couldn't<00:00:32.640> have

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
capable of getting in they couldn't have

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.690 
capable of getting in they couldn't have
more<00:00:33.059> than<00:00:33.180> two<00:00:33.360> teams<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.860> hopefully

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
more than two teams in so hopefully

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240 
more than two teams in so hopefully
we'll<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:37.050> teams<00:00:37.380> by<00:00:37.649> using<00:00:37.890> some

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
we'll get the right teams by using some

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.220 
we'll get the right teams by using some
of<00:00:38.280> those<00:00:39.440> that<00:00:40.440> knowledge<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.040> experience<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
of those that knowledge and experience I

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.479 
of those that knowledge and experience I
would<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.559> concerned<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.340> we

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
would be a little concerned if we

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
would be a little concerned if we
continue<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.090> expand<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.930> terms<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
continue to expand in terms of the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
continue to expand in terms of the
number<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.950> games<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.610> college<00:00:48.120> players

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
number of games that college players

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.590 
number of games that college players
have<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.870> play<00:00:49.730> that's<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.390> something

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
have to play that's not really something

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.040 
have to play that's not really something
that<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:52.850> think<00:00:53.850> we've<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> reaching<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that i think we've kind of reaching the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.590 
that i think we've kind of reaching the
saturation<00:00:55.800> point<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.480> it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
saturation point I do think it's

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.310 
saturation point I do think it's
important<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> future<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.920> our<00:00:59.309> fans<00:00:59.699> to

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
important in the future for our fans to

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
important in the future for our fans to
play<00:01:01.320> quality<00:01:01.890> games<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.850> everybody

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
play quality games I think everybody

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.270 
play quality games I think everybody
wants<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.690> quality<00:01:04.320> games<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.860> think<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
wants to see quality games I think it's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
wants to see quality games I think it's
important<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:05.939> continue<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:06.869> fans

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
important that we continue to get fans

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.920 
important that we continue to get fans
to<00:01:08.010> come<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> experience<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to come out and have the experience in

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.109 
to come out and have the experience in
the<00:01:10.200> stadium<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.010> they're<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.939> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the stadium and they're going to do that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
the stadium and they're going to do that
if<00:01:12.299> we're<00:01:12.479> playing<00:01:12.600> quality<00:01:13.229> games<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.799> if

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
if we're playing quality games and if

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.679 
if we're playing quality games and if
we're<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> play<00:01:14.880> those<00:01:15.119> games<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
we're going to play those games got to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.980 
we're going to play those games got to
play<00:01:15.900> against<00:01:16.530> good<00:01:16.799> teams<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:18.180> would<00:01:18.840> like

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
play against good teams so I would like

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
play against good teams so I would like
to<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.500> conference<00:01:20.040> games<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> would

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to see more conference games and I would

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
to see more conference games and I would
like<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.360> games<00:01:21.689> even<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.380> 12<00:01:22.740> games

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
like to see more games even all 12 games

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.630 
like to see more games even all 12 games
with<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.390> Big<00:01:24.540> Five<00:01:24.780> conferences<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
with in the Big Five conferences and I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
with in the Big Five conferences and I
would<00:01:27.650> but<00:01:28.650> I'd<00:01:28.770> also<00:01:29.900> because<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
would but I'd also because but the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.899 
would but I'd also because but the
reason<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.979> people<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.460> want<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
reason that people don't want to do that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.690 
reason that people don't want to do that
is<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.450> can't<00:01:33.659> qualify<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.350> bowl<00:01:34.500> games<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
is they can't qualify for bowl games so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.069 
is they can't qualify for bowl games so
I<00:01:35.729> don't<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.479> should<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> qualify

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
I don't think we should have to qualify

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
I don't think we should have to qualify
for<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.650> bowl<00:01:37.829> game<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.579> committee

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
for a bowl game I think some committee

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.130 
for a bowl game I think some committee
should<00:01:39.000> pick<00:01:39.329> them<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
should pick them just like they do in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
should pick them just like they do in
basketball<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> doesn't<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.310> anything

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
basketball and it doesn't have anything

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.210 
basketball and it doesn't have anything
to<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:42.030> record<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.840> has<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.950> with

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to do with your record it has to do with

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
to do with your record it has to do with
quality<00:01:44.729> wins<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> type

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
quality wins and you know all that type

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.819 
quality wins and you know all that type
of<00:01:46.590> stuff<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.470> don't<00:01:49.740> have

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
of stuff you know I really don't have

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.450

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
in the NFL and I don't really understand

why<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:10.020> wasn't<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.679> way<00:02:10.739> when<00:02:11.129> we

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
why that is it wasn't that way when we

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
why that is it wasn't that way when we
had<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> 25<00:02:11.940> second<00:02:12.420> clock

had a 25 second clock

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.680 
had a 25 second clock
why<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.800> changed<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.760> got<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> 40<00:02:15.300> second

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
why it changed when we got a 40 second

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.750 
why it changed when we got a 40 second
clock<00:02:15.900> they<00:02:16.230> change<00:02:16.530> from<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.770> 25<00:02:17.220> second<00:02:17.610> clock

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
clock they change from a 25 second clock

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.970 
clock they change from a 25 second clock
to<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.030> 40-second<00:02:18.599> clock<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> NFL<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to a 40-second clock in the NFL but it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.390 
to a 40-second clock in the NFL but it
didn't<00:02:20.280> change<00:02:20.810> pace<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.050> play<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:23.040> didn't

and<00:02:27.379> you<00:02:28.379> know<00:02:28.530> my<00:02:29.220> concerns<00:02:29.760> our<00:02:30.620> players

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and you know my concerns our players

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.330 
and you know my concerns our players
should<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:32.010> able<00:02:32.099> to<00:02:32.310> line<00:02:32.519> up<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.910> defense<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
should be able to line up on defense and

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.270 
should be able to line up on defense and
our<00:02:35.340> rules<00:02:35.700> should<00:02:35.970> always<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:37.260> reflective<00:02:37.980> of

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
our rules should always be reflective of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.619 
our rules should always be reflective of
player<00:02:39.120> safety<00:02:39.480> in<00:02:39.900> terms<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:41.330> how<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.390> can

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
player safety in terms of how you can

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.410 
player safety in terms of how you can
get<00:02:42.780> players<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> out<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.799> game<00:02:44.120> as<00:02:45.120> well

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
get players in and out of a game as well

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.210 
get players in and out of a game as well
as<00:02:45.569> how<00:02:45.720> many<00:02:45.930> plays<00:02:46.230> they<00:02:46.620> play<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.099> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
as how many plays they play in the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.860 
as how many plays they play in the
cumulative<00:02:47.519> effect<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.269> might<00:02:48.599> have

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
cumulative effect that that might have

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.059 
cumulative effect that that might have
on<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.430> down<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.610> road<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.319> that's<00:02:52.319> really

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
on them down the road so that's really

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.000 
on them down the road so that's really
all<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:53.910> got<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.299> say<00:02:54.329> about<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.720> Nick<00:02:55.709> last

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
time you were replacing a quarterback

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.470 
time you were replacing a quarterback
you<00:02:58.920> let<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.549> battle<00:02:59.700> go<00:02:59.910> into<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> season

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
you let the battle go into the season

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.539 
you let the battle go into the season

over are you comfortable going that

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.370 
over are you comfortable going that
route<00:03:02.700> again<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.239> plays<00:03:03.420> itself<00:03:03.569> out<00:03:04.049> or

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
route again if it plays itself out or

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.530 
route again if it plays itself out or
did<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.650> see<00:03:04.890> any<00:03:05.060> hindrances<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.120> aj's

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
development because he didn't have

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.949 
development because he didn't have
control<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.280> team<00:03:08.610> until<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.540> games<00:03:09.750> had
