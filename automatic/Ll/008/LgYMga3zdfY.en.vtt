00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:10.130
 he missed the europe stoxx he worth what 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.130
 Valley 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.609
 good opp I said beauty guys should 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.590
 finish and no longer bringing a video 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.080
 commented to you with a news 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 very interesting that I sincerely 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.279
 that from here if seeing there is news that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.369
 I speak 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.820
 It gives me a certain fear but at the same time 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.820
 What a scare, I like it because it looks only 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.329
 It's a nice thing to read if you hear 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.329
 huh 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 Microsoft can give full support to 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 mouse and keyboard for xbox one did it 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.530
 think spoke on twitter answering a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.230
 tweet beside a fellow who was 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 Next he made her think of the xbox 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.430
 human needs faster support 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 possible for mouse and incredible that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.289
 seems to have made him think he replied 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.109
 speaking that the engineers already working 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.840
 in this function for xbox ban as it goes 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.020
 have this compatibility with windows 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.000
 10 of the pc is very likely to have 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.100
 full mouse compatibility 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.409
 keyboard on xbox ban 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.960
 We already know that you can use keyboard 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.750
 on consoles like xbox iran gives you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.880
 Clarín is for you to type in some 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.250
 cases per message such as I particularly 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.280
 I do not know how it works I never tried 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.130
 to be honest, but in terms of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.720
 mouse is impossible is not still can 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.939
 use the mouse on the console 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.579
 but imagine you could use a mouse 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.060
 keyboard in the video game would be just about the time 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.490
 huh 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.920
 I do not know if it will only be on the menu by 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.710
 example in how to access the menu 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.810
 entire keyboard mouse would be 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 a much simpler business a business 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.110
 much faster and we've never seen 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.659
 a console, right? 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.790
 the colleague if he with mouse controlling 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.680
 he the little one or if not I do not know 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.009
 particularly how it will work 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.500
 and imagine if you have to play with 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.930
 mouse keyboard I honestly think 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.049
 which is a good one but at the same time as a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.450
 good can be a chill because games like 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.979
 call of duty we will assume that you have 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.210
 greater accuracy 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.060
 playing with the keyboard mouse then 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.270
 this in itself a safe from you there who knows 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.270
 just an example in itself a car of this type 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.120
 black ops 3 you can play and it is 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.690
 with the keyboard mouse against a person 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.000
 which plays with traditional control 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.800
 old would be a handicap of the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.230
 plays with the mouse 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.780
 keyboard in terms of fps would be a 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.570
 demonstrates a disadvantage because it is much 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.150
 fast is much more will be very old 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.120
 More accurate mouse keyboard in this aspect 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.560
 so I can honestly see 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.600
 that says swing a little 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.570
 I do not know if it could be my opinion. 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.430
 It may not even balance, but I 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.190
 I think the opinion of me but by another 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.270
 side could be a good move in case 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.730
 we had old pc games and in 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.930
 consoles like for example a will be old 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.900
 league of legends 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.020
 imagine a version of it of legends for 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.420
 the xbox cloth in case for console would be 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.300
 very interesting with the mouse keyboard us 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.330
 we could have in the future who knows games 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.030
 In this style, I do not know. 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.250
 I miss this many pc long stop 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.160
 but which one was old would be serious 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.100
 interesting a new way of playing games 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.620
 computer on a console imagines that 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.990
 soon you buy a console and can 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.600
 use it more or less like pc you 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.270
 enters the internet and can use the 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.510
 mouse keyboard to access internet not 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.800
 xbox morning browser and youtube everything 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.620
 through xbox ban 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.750
 imagine here fuck it would be which is old 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 honestly i think it would be cool 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.650
 but as I said nothing has to do with the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.290
 What would this business be in the games part? 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.390
 it's phil spencer did not say much 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.230
 still spoke only that he has the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.210
 possibility of arriving in the case the mouse 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.070
 is the compatibility with the mouse 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.530
 we'll see in the future but good to see is this 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.380
 right there is not much else to say 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.900
 as long as you liked it, you would like 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.720
 to use mouse keyboard on console sérgio 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.270
 What do I need, honestly? I think. 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.430
 which is not necessary because a video game 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.290
 It was not meant for you to use a mouse. 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.180
 keyboard on it if you want to mouse 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.030
 keyboards and you are going to propose that you are connected 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.160
 but it would be a good innovation 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.380
 at the time that would give more prominence 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.450
 for microsoft in the case of xbox the year 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.920
 Let's see if in the future we get it right. 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.380
 Good, thank you, everybody. 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.000
 who attended the exchange team liked it and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.010
 do not forget to sign up for the 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.380
 channel not to lose the level of future 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.120
 are several videos of the days of beauty and only 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.070
 I'm going to stay here a lot thanks to 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.070
 everyone was worth that hug again
