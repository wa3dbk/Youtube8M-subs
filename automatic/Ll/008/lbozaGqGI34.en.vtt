00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
cuttlefish and the monster bellies would

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.980 
cuttlefish and the monster bellies would
sell<00:03:02.890> for<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.160> four<00:03:03.520> gold<00:03:03.850> each<00:03:04.210> it's

for one gold each and then you just do

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.050 
for one gold each and then you just do
the<00:03:20.170> math<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.560> how<00:03:20.860> quickly<00:03:21.520> you<00:03:21.730> can<00:03:21.850> catch

the math on how quickly you can catch

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.380 
the math on how quickly you can catch
some<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.840> know<00:03:22.870> if<00:03:23.020> each<00:03:23.200> cast<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:24.390> they've

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
some you know if each cast is they've

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.000 
some you know if each cast is they've
reduced<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:25.870> now<00:03:25.959> i<00:03:25.990> think<00:03:26.080> it's<00:03:26.320> each<00:03:26.560> cast<00:03:26.830> is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
reduced it now i think it's each cast is

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.730 
reduced it now i think it's each cast is
what<00:03:27.160> 18<00:03:27.550> seconds<00:03:27.940> 16<00:03:28.630> seconds<00:03:28.990> here<00:03:29.200> let's

i'm<00:03:55.120> sure<00:03:55.450> if<00:03:55.570> i<00:03:55.630> did<00:03:55.780> some<00:03:55.930> research<00:03:55.959> i<00:03:56.320> could

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
i'm sure if i did some research i could

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.400 
i'm sure if i did some research i could
find<00:03:56.560> out<00:03:56.770> you<00:03:56.920> know<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.220> could<00:03:57.670> probably<00:03:58.410> get

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
find out you know you could probably get

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.000 
find out you know you could probably get
some<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.650> those<00:04:01.260> treats<00:04:02.260> you<00:04:02.560> know<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.770> pet

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
some of those treats you know the pet

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.410 
some of those treats you know the pet
treats<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.520> you<00:04:03.610> could<00:04:03.760> probably<00:04:03.970> make<00:04:04.209> those

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
treats and you could probably make those

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.810 
treats and you could probably make those
penguins<00:04:05.410> become<00:04:05.680> friendly<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.550> one<00:04:06.670> for

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.729 
that was funny got all these little
penguins<00:04:09.790> standing<00:04:10.060> around<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:11.260> here<00:04:11.440> there's

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
penguins standing around so here there's

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.120 
penguins standing around so here there's
another<00:04:12.010> deep<00:04:12.400> sea<00:04:12.580> monster<00:04:12.940> belly<00:04:13.090> school

like<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.220> say<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.550> again<00:04:15.730> if<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.810> fish<00:04:17.049> have

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
like I say that again if a fish have

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.930 
like I say that again if a fish have
really<00:04:17.500> dropped<00:04:17.680> on<00:04:17.859> your<00:04:17.950> market<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.489> it's
