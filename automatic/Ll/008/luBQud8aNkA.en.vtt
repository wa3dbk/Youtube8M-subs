use<00:01:30.210> pork<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.140> could<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> boneless

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
use pork but you could use a boneless

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.580 
use pork but you could use a boneless
this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.670> bone-in<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this is bone-in and I like it like that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.460 
this is bone-in and I like it like that
and<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.009> also<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> fat<00:01:36.030> cap<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.960> top<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and I also like the fat cap on the top I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.319 
and I also like the fat cap on the top I
think<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.189> adds<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.549> flavor<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.180> works

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
think it adds more flavor and it works

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.969 
think it adds more flavor and it works
