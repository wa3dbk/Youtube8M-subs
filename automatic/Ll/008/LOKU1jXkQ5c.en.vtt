correcting<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:31.979> editing<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> video<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
correcting we're editing the video and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
correcting we're editing the video and
we<00:01:33.270> brought<00:01:33.509> Dan<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.200> help<00:01:34.439> us<00:01:34.619> make<00:01:35.130> this

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
we brought Dan in to help us make this

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
we brought Dan in to help us make this
shot<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.270> better<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> bad

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
shot look a little better not a bad

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.200 
shot look a little better not a bad
looking<00:01:37.259> shot<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.549> interesting

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
looking shot is not all that interesting

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.700 
looking shot is not all that interesting
yeah<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> perfect<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.229> starting<00:01:40.530> point

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
yeah it's a perfect like starting point

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
yeah it's a perfect like starting point
for<00:01:40.890> pretty<00:01:41.369> much<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> jobs<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.299> cool

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
for pretty much all the jobs I do cool

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
for pretty much all the jobs I do cool
so<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.560> make<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> little<00:01:43.890> bit<00:01:43.979> bigger<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.369> we

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
so if I make a little bit bigger and we

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.300 
so if I make a little bit bigger and we
kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.320> I<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.220> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
kind of think about it I can see that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.350 
kind of think about it I can see that
there's<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> huge<00:01:47.909> amount<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.149> shadow

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
there's not a huge amount of shadow

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.660 
there's not a huge amount of shadow
detail<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.530> his<00:01:49.649> guitar<00:01:49.950> case<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
detail so like in his guitar case so I

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
detail so like in his guitar case so I
wouldn't<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> super<00:01:52.020> low

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
wouldn't want to go for a super low

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
wouldn't want to go for a super low
contrast<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:53.909> not

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
contrast look on this so if you're not

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.249 
contrast look on this so if you're not
going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> low<00:01:54.479> contrast<00:01:54.869> why<00:01:55.110> not

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
going to go to low contrast why not

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.080 
going to go to low contrast why not
embrace<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.040> there's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> couple<00:01:56.939> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
embrace it so there's a couple of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.160 
embrace it so there's a couple of
different<00:01:57.329> ways<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
different ways of doing it I'm going to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
different ways of doing it I'm going to
show<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.770> easy<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.189> first<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
show you the easy way first and then I

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810 
show you the easy way first and then I
like<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.170> easy<00:02:01.409> that's<00:02:01.740> my<00:02:01.890> life<00:02:02.070> so

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
like you I like easy that's my life so

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.670 
like you I like easy that's my life so
and<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.509> reason<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.810> go<00:02:03.930> easy<00:02:04.140> first<00:02:04.439> is

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and the reason I go easy first is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.959 
and the reason I go easy first is
because<00:02:04.829> if<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.310> grading<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> want

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
because if you're grading it you want

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.160 
because if you're grading it you want
maybe<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> want<00:02:07.110> to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
maybe you don't like it so you want to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.229 
maybe you don't like it so you want to
go<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.469> get<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> same<00:02:07.950> kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.910> film

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
go and get the same kind of film

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
go and get the same kind of film
emulation<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.840> quick<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.140> possible<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.920> then

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
emulation as quick as possible and then

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.790 
emulation as quick as possible and then
we<00:02:11.129> can<00:02:11.420> redefine<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.660> ourselves<00:02:12.750> okay

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
we can redefine it ourselves okay

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.430 
we can redefine it ourselves okay
I'm<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.550> add<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> note<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:16.350> you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
I'm just going to add a note so if you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.110 
I'm just going to add a note so if you
know<00:02:16.560> resolve<00:02:16.890> adding<00:02:17.460> nodes<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> where<00:02:17.970> all

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
know resolve adding nodes is where all

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.640 
know resolve adding nodes is where all
your<00:02:18.150> layers<00:02:18.450> take<00:02:18.750> place<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.230> notice

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
your layers take place and notice

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.070 
your layers take place and notice
another<00:02:19.860> not<00:02:20.850> exactly<00:02:21.360> synonymous<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.020> it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
another not exactly synonymous but it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.570 
another not exactly synonymous but it
would<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.500> adding<00:02:22.860> an<00:02:22.950> additional<00:02:23.340> layer

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
would be like adding an additional layer

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.580 
would be like adding an additional layer
or<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> sort<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.660> another<00:02:24.870> container<00:02:25.230> where<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
or a sort of another container where you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.590 
or a sort of another container where you
can<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:25.860> effects<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.490> node<00:02:27.000> base<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.480> know

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
can have effects and node base you know

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.940 
can have effects and node base you know
sort<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> grading<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.620> pretty<00:02:28.800> powerful

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
sort of grading it's pretty powerful

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
sort of grading it's pretty powerful
yeah<00:02:29.370> exactly<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.420> jump<00:02:30.990> back<00:02:31.140> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
yeah exactly so you can jump back and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.780 
yeah exactly so you can jump back and
forward<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.710> I'm<00:02:31.770> not<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> very<00:02:32.160> linear<00:02:32.490> kind

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
forward and I'm not a very linear kind

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.370 
forward and I'm not a very linear kind
of<00:02:32.910> guy<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.210> remembered<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.900> halfway<00:02:34.170> through

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
of guy I remembered like halfway through

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.230 
of guy I remembered like halfway through
we<00:02:34.890> want<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.130> give<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.340> guy<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> greater<00:02:36.030> rate

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
we want to give this guy a greater rate

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.640 
we want to give this guy a greater rate
right<00:02:36.420> right<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.170> back<00:02:37.350> okay

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
right right so we can just go back okay

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.220 
right right so we can just go back okay
so<00:02:37.710> get<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.250> yeah<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.880> what<00:02:39.810> magic<00:02:40.080> have

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
so get in it yeah so what magic have

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.320 
so get in it yeah so what magic have
included<00:02:40.560> these<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> recent<00:02:41.400> update<00:02:41.550> which

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
included these in a recent update which

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.990 
included these in a recent update which
is<00:02:42.740> our<00:02:43.740> film<00:02:43.950> looks<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.550> you're<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:44.820> click

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
is our film looks so you're right click

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000 
is our film looks so you're right click
to<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> clip<00:02:45.390> went<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> where<00:02:45.840> 3d<00:02:46.140> lut<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.590> 3d

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to the clip went to where 3d lut a 3d

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.430 
to the clip went to where 3d lut a 3d
lut<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.370> then<00:02:47.550> film<00:02:47.880> work<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:49.080> this

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
lut and then film work on this now this

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.750 
lut and then film work on this now this
is<00:02:49.590> probably<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.040> spark<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.340> debate<00:02:50.460> but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is probably going to spark a debate but

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.880 
is probably going to spark a debate but
I<00:02:50.820> prefer<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.330> Kodak<00:02:51.720> style<00:02:52.080> looks<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:52.560> right

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I prefer the Kodak style looks all right

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.340 
I prefer the Kodak style looks all right
it's<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.520> Coke<00:02:53.850> or<00:02:54.150> Pepsi<00:02:54.180> which<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:54.960> deal<00:02:55.140> I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
it's like Coke or Pepsi which one deal I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.950 
it's like Coke or Pepsi which one deal I
exactly<00:02:55.950> one<00:02:56.850> thing<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.120> note<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.450> these<00:02:57.690> are

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
exactly one thing to note is these are

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.350 
exactly one thing to note is these are
normally<00:02:58.800> made<00:02:58.980> for<00:02:59.220> log<00:02:59.400> source<00:02:59.880> material

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
normally made for log source material

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.580 
normally made for log source material
but<00:03:00.540> I'll<00:03:00.780> show<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:00.990> how<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.260> around<00:03:01.380> them

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
but I'll show you how to get around them

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.870 
but I'll show you how to get around them
a<00:03:01.680> lot<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.950> source<00:03:02.160> material<00:03:02.190> being<00:03:02.700> like

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
a lot of source material being like

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.150 
a lot of source material being like
really<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.630> some<00:03:04.350> footage<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.830> we<00:03:05.130> shot

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
really like some footage that we shot

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.060 
really like some footage that we shot
maybe<00:03:05.460> like<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.880> lexer<00:03:06.360> okay<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:08.040> I

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
maybe like on a lexer okay so when I

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.230 
maybe like on a lexer okay so when I
click<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.340> button<00:03:08.520> it's<00:03:08.760> gonna<00:03:08.850> look<00:03:09.030> crazy

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
click this button it's gonna look crazy

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.750 
click this button it's gonna look crazy
but<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:10.110> know<00:03:10.140> spare<00:03:10.980> with<00:03:11.130> me<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.460> second

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
but you know spare with me for a second

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.970 
but you know spare with me for a second
so<00:03:12.240> that's<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> look<00:03:13.080> applied<00:03:13.410> now<00:03:13.770> we<00:03:13.830> might

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
so that's the look applied now we might

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.170 
so that's the look applied now we might
as<00:03:14.070> well<00:03:14.130> have<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> look<00:03:14.430> at<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.730> can<00:03:14.880> see<00:03:15.030> my

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
as well have a look at it you can see my

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.660 
as well have a look at it you can see my
shadows<00:03:15.570> have<00:03:15.750> gone<00:03:16.130> insane<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.460> have<00:03:17.640> a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
shadows have gone insane you have a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.370 
shadows have gone insane you have a
little<00:03:17.940> crunchy<00:03:18.360> little<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.720> little<00:03:18.990> hard<00:03:19.290> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
little crunchy little a little hard to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.140 
little crunchy little a little hard to
make<00:03:19.500> anything<00:03:19.740> out<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.250> black<00:03:20.580> very<00:03:20.940> exact

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
make anything out but black very exact

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.600 
make anything out but black very exact
contrast<00:03:21.660> contrast<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.950> straightaway<00:03:23.550> you

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
contrast contrast and straightaway you

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.880 
contrast contrast and straightaway you
can<00:03:23.820> look<00:03:23.940> at<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.120> client<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.510> say<00:03:24.890> yeah

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
can look at your client and say yeah

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.010 
can look at your client and say yeah
well<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.280> think<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.270> looks<00:03:27.600> like<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.900> and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
well I think that looks like this and

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.810 
well I think that looks like this and
I'm<00:03:28.140> thinking<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.560> like<00:03:28.740> Guy<00:03:29.040> Ritchie<00:03:29.400> Phil

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
I'm thinking of like Guy Ritchie Phil

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.180 
I'm thinking of like Guy Ritchie Phil
and<00:03:30.210> lightly<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:31.050> know<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.320> very<00:03:31.560> organic

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
and lightly you know that very organic

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.760 
and lightly you know that very organic
16<00:03:32.640> millimeter<00:03:33.120> type<00:03:33.420> look<00:03:33.690> right<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.500> quite

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
16 millimeter type look right that quite

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.530 
16 millimeter type look right that quite
bleeps<00:03:35.040> bypass<00:03:35.550> but<00:03:35.940> kind<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.240> that<00:03:36.360> same

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
bleeps bypass but kind of that same

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.660 
bleeps bypass but kind of that same
thing<00:03:36.780> exactly<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.890> let's<00:03:38.190> say<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.340> want<00:03:38.550> some

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
thing exactly so let's say you want some

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.860 
thing exactly so let's say you want some
of<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.790> characteristics<00:03:39.420> but<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.630> don't

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
of the characteristics but you don't

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.110 
of the characteristics but you don't
want<00:03:40.080> to<00:03:40.320> crush<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.130> heavily<00:03:41.550> okay<00:03:41.820> we'll

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
want to crush it so heavily okay we'll

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.640 
want to crush it so heavily okay we'll
just<00:03:42.300> go<00:03:42.390> back<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.570> node<00:03:42.870> number<00:03:42.990> 1<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.560> I've

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
just go back to node number 1 so I've

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.740 
just go back to node number 1 so I've
double<00:03:44.040> clicked<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.730> we<00:03:45.450> want<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.690> go

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
double clicked on that and we want to go

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.050 
double clicked on that and we want to go
to<00:03:45.810> our<00:03:46.020> contrasts<00:03:46.740> and<00:03:46.920> if<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:47.610> just<00:03:47.850> use<00:03:48.030> my

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
to our contrasts and if I just use my

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.730 
to our contrasts and if I just use my
highlight<00:03:48.660> mode<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.290> showing<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
highlight mode so this is showing you

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.950 
highlight mode so this is showing you
what<00:03:49.770> I'm<00:03:50.010> doing<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.310> node<00:03:50.460> 1<00:03:50.670> yeah<00:03:51.210> you'll<00:03:51.870> see

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
what I'm doing to node 1 yeah you'll see

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.420 
what I'm doing to node 1 yeah you'll see
that<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.380> going<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.530> bring<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:52.980> back<00:03:53.130> so

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
that I'm just going to bring it back so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.700 
that I'm just going to bring it back so
it's<00:03:53.580> super<00:03:54.030> soft<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:54.870> there's<00:03:55.050> no<00:03:55.170> like<00:03:55.440> mega

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
it's super soft so there's no like mega

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.110 
it's super soft so there's no like mega
contrast<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.580> you're<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.820> basically

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
contrast so you're just basically

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.240 
contrast so you're just basically
lifting<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.750> blacks<00:03:57.990> on<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.350> region<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.040> I'm

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
lifting the blacks on this region so I'm

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.680 
lifting the blacks on this region so I'm
not<00:03:59.370> cushioning<00:03:59.820> it<00:03:59.940> before<00:04:00.210> it<00:04:00.330> gets<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.660> the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
not cushioning it before it gets to the

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.510 
not cushioning it before it gets to the
lookup<00:04:01.200> table<00:04:01.320> ok<00:04:01.740> then<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.190> turn<00:04:02.400> off<00:04:02.490> my

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
lookup table ok then I turn off my

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.610 
lookup table ok then I turn off my
highlight<00:04:02.940> modes<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.360> you'll<00:04:03.600> see<00:04:03.960> that

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
highlight modes and you'll see that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.470 
highlight modes and you'll see that
we've<00:04:04.710> got<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.890> pretty<00:04:05.070> pretty<00:04:05.850> pleasing<00:04:06.120> image

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
we've got a pretty pretty pleasing image

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.460 
we've got a pretty pretty pleasing image
this<00:04:06.600> guy's<00:04:06.810> probably<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.200> little<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.440> too

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
this guy's probably a little bit too

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.650 
this guy's probably a little bit too
blown<00:04:07.860> out<00:04:08.040> but<00:04:08.190> that's<00:04:08.310> our<00:04:08.700> ok<00:04:09.360> film

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
blown out but that's our ok film

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.940 
blown out but that's our ok film
character<00:04:09.990> is<00:04:10.050> you've<00:04:10.290> got<00:04:10.440> those<00:04:10.530> nice<00:04:10.770> kind

character is you've got those nice kind
of<00:04:10.980> inky<00:04:11.250> blacks<00:04:11.490> cool<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:12.510> kind<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.230> and

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
of inky blacks cool so you kind of and

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
of inky blacks cool so you kind of and
just<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.130> recap<00:04:14.280> on<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.700> basically<00:04:15.209> you

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
just to recap on this basically you

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.690 
just to recap on this basically you
added<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.170> lot<00:04:16.380> on<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:16.770> of<00:04:16.859> these<00:04:16.980> nodes<00:04:17.190> yes<00:04:17.459> it

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
added a lot on one of these nodes yes it

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.130 
added a lot on one of these nodes yes it
was<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> little<00:04:18.000> too<00:04:18.209> contrast<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.020> just
