00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.659 

this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.199> my<00:00:01.410> little<00:00:01.589> Harrison<00:00:02.070> Miller<00:00:02.250> which

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
this is my little Harrison Miller which

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:03.619 
this is my little Harrison Miller which
I've<00:00:02.850> set<00:00:03.000> up<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.179> hobby

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
I've set up a hobby

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.530 
I've set up a hobby
today<00:00:04.380> I'm<00:00:04.650> making<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.400> pulley<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> x-axis

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
today I'm making a pulley for the x-axis

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.570 
today I'm making a pulley for the x-axis
I'm<00:00:07.200> in<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.379> middle<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.589> converting<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.160> CNC

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
I'm in the middle of converting to CNC

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.730 
I'm in the middle of converting to CNC
and<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.719> far<00:00:09.960> I've<00:00:10.019> done<00:00:10.139> as<00:00:10.290> eight<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> Y

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
and so far I've done as eight on the Y

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.490 
and so far I've done as eight on the Y
but<00:00:10.950> not<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.219> X<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.870> need<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> special<00:00:13.259> kind<00:00:13.380> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
but not the X I need a special kind of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.780 
but not the X I need a special kind of
pulley<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.219> I'm<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.519> make<00:00:14.700> you

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
pulley for this so I'm going to make you

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.960 
pulley for this so I'm going to make you
myself<00:00:15.030> rather<00:00:15.299> than<00:00:15.389> buy<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:16.760> you<00:00:17.760> might

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
myself rather than buy one you might

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.880 
myself rather than buy one you might
have<00:00:18.090> seen<00:00:18.300> my<00:00:18.449> other<00:00:18.600> hobby<00:00:18.960> video<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
have seen my other hobby video with the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.750 
have seen my other hobby video with the
mini<00:00:20.039> mill<00:00:20.250> which<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.789> over<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.630> ear

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
mini mill which is over the right ear

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
mini mill which is over the right ear
this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.439> much<00:00:25.439> better<00:00:25.619> meal<00:00:25.890> made<00:00:26.130> by

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
this is a much better meal made by

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.890 
this is a much better meal made by
people<00:00:26.400> ten<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.789> two<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.750> we're

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
people ten one two I can do what we're

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
people ten one two I can do what we're
doing<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> underlying<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:30.179> principles

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
doing but the underlying with principles

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.290 
doing but the underlying with principles
you<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.199> same<00:00:31.610> basically<00:00:32.610> at<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you get to the same basically at the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.510 
you get to the same basically at the
back<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> spindle<00:00:35.030> there's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.300> resolver

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
back of the spindle there's a resolver

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
back of the spindle there's a resolver
that<00:00:38.520> measures<00:00:38.820> things<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.149> revolutions<00:00:42.170> then

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that measures things or revolutions then

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.330 
that measures things or revolutions then
linuxcnc<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:45.239> used<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.840> cover<00:00:46.469> control<00:00:47.010> and

electrons<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.239> gear<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:48.989> spindles

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
electrons they gear the two spindles

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
electrons they gear the two spindles
together<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.160> software<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.480> number

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
together in software and this number

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.319 
together in software and this number
here<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.460> in<00:00:53.460> row<00:00:53.640> number<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.000> teeth<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
here is in row number of teeth and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.900 
here is in row number of teeth and
command<00:00:54.629> currently<00:00:54.960> programmed<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.410> produce

so<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.989> rotate<00:00:59.090> then<00:01:00.090> I'll<00:01:00.180> turn<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so as I rotate then I'll turn this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
so as I rotate then I'll turn this
spindle<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.250> I'll<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.460> other<00:01:02.640> spindle

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
spindle here I'll see the other spindle

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.200 
spindle here I'll see the other spindle
goes<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:04.350> say<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.920> 1/5<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
goes let's say right at 1/5 this for you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.399 
goes let's say right at 1/5 this for you
and<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.049> make<00:01:07.229> me<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.560> 5-2<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:09.409> I'm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and that would make me a 5-2 here I'm

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.750 
and that would make me a 5-2 here I'm
not<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> make<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> fire<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.310> gig<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.640> make

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
not going to make a fire to a gig I make

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.330 
not going to make a fire to a gig I make
a<00:01:11.790> 49<00:01:12.270> tooth<00:01:12.479> gear<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> force<00:01:13.650> 19<00:01:14.040> he<00:01:14.189> can

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
a 49 tooth gear and a force 19 he can

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.289 
a 49 tooth gear and a force 19 he can
barely<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> there

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
barely see you there

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
barely see you there
the<00:01:16.020> workpiece<00:01:17.009> moving<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> say

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the workpiece moving so if just to say

00:01:20.729 --> 00:02:41.559 
the workpiece moving so if just to say
it<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:20.880> either<00:01:21.000> one<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.750> lot<00:01:22.619> stronger
