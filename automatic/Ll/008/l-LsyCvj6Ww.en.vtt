hi everyone Greg asked you again with

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.039 
hi everyone Greg asked you again with
Jackson<00:00:11.740> clinics<00:00:12.100> we're<00:00:13.030> here<00:00:13.240> in<00:00:13.330> April<00:00:13.540> to

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
Jackson clinics we're here in April to

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.999 
Jackson clinics we're here in April to
talk<00:00:14.530> about<00:00:14.820> science<00:00:16.349> specifically<00:00:17.349> the

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.009 
talk about science specifically the

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.600 
talk about science specifically the
stretch<00:00:18.460> shortening<00:00:19.210> cycle<00:00:19.770> okay<00:00:20.800> the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
stretch shortening cycle okay the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.429 
stretch shortening cycle okay the
stretch<00:00:21.849> shortening<00:00:22.270> cycle<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.990> a<00:00:23.050> term<00:00:23.410> that

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
stretch shortening cycle is a term that

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.760 
stretch shortening cycle is a term that
describes<00:00:24.779> basically<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:26.140> reflexive

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
describes basically the reflexive

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.799 
describes basically the reflexive
activity<00:00:27.399> that<00:00:27.610> takes<00:00:27.849> place<00:00:28.390> in<00:00:28.689> a

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:28.809 
activity that takes place in a

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:30.720 
activity that takes place in a
neuromuscular<00:00:29.500> Junction<00:00:29.950> when<00:00:30.160> a<00:00:30.189> muscle<00:00:30.640> is

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
neuromuscular Junction when a muscle is

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.729 
neuromuscular Junction when a muscle is
quickly<00:00:31.029> stretched<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.869> how<00:00:32.410> that's<00:00:32.559> going

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
quickly stretched and how that's going

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.360 
quickly stretched and how that's going
to<00:00:32.829> reflexively<00:00:33.489> make<00:00:33.790> it<00:00:33.940> fire<00:00:34.120> powerfully

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
to reflexively make it fire powerfully

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.950 
to reflexively make it fire powerfully
what<00:00:36.370> we're<00:00:36.460> going<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.610> do<00:00:36.820> is<00:00:36.940> show<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.660> how

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
what we're going to do is show you how

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.579 
what we're going to do is show you how
this<00:00:38.829> works<00:00:39.130> in<00:00:39.880> muscle<00:00:40.390> reflexes<00:00:40.929> and<00:00:41.170> show

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
this works in muscle reflexes and show

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.290 
this works in muscle reflexes and show
you<00:00:41.679> how<00:00:41.859> that<00:00:41.920> can<00:00:42.129> directly<00:00:42.670> improve<00:00:43.120> your

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
you how that can directly improve your

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.110 
you how that can directly improve your
split<00:00:43.600> jerk<00:00:43.780> if<00:00:43.989> done<00:00:44.199> properly<00:00:44.760> okay<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:45.820> one

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
split jerk if done properly okay so one

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.520 
split jerk if done properly okay so one
thing<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.420> understand<00:00:46.960> about<00:00:47.079> the<00:00:47.289> stretch

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
thing to understand about the stretch

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.009 
thing to understand about the stretch
shortening<00:00:47.949> cycle<00:00:48.160> is<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:49.120> all<00:00:49.329> muscle

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
shortening cycle is that all muscle

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.380 
shortening cycle is that all muscle
fibers<00:00:50.469> have<00:00:50.949> embedded<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.820> them<00:00:51.999> something

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
fibers have embedded in them something

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.560 
fibers have embedded in them something
called<00:00:53.489> muscle<00:00:54.489> spindles<00:00:54.879> okay<00:00:55.300> muscle

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
called muscle spindles okay muscle

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.380 
called muscle spindles okay muscle
spindles<00:00:56.109> are<00:00:56.530> little<00:00:57.039> Springs<00:00:57.429> that<00:00:58.179> wrap

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
spindles are little Springs that wrap

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.910 
spindles are little Springs that wrap
around<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.839> muscle<00:00:59.140> fibers<00:00:59.499> and<00:00:59.679> they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
around the muscle fibers and they

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.430 
around the muscle fibers and they
respond<00:01:00.339> one<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:01.030> changes<00:01:01.780> in<00:01:01.870> muscle<00:01:01.989> length

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
respond one to changes in muscle length

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.090 
respond one to changes in muscle length
and<00:01:02.739> also<00:01:03.239> velocity<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> if<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.620> muscle<00:01:05.980> is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
and also velocity so if a muscle is

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.330 
and also velocity so if a muscle is
stretched<00:01:06.870> quickly<00:01:07.870> then<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.920> muscle

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
stretched quickly then the muscle

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.430 
stretched quickly then the muscle
spindle<00:01:09.729> is<00:01:09.880> going<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.090> activate<00:01:10.479> your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
spindle is going to activate your

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.470 
spindle is going to activate your
sensory<00:01:11.950> nerves<00:01:12.159> to<00:01:12.430> travel<00:01:13.150> up<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
sensory nerves to travel up to the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.090 
sensory nerves to travel up to the
spinal<00:01:13.750> cord<00:01:13.900> spinal<00:01:14.560> cord<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:14.890> going<00:01:14.920> to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
spinal cord spinal cord is going to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.130 
spinal cord spinal cord is going to
reflexively<00:01:15.670> send<00:01:16.000> back<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.390> signal<00:01:16.930> to<00:01:17.050> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
reflexively send back a signal to the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.770 
reflexively send back a signal to the
muscle<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.560> fire<00:01:17.890> okay<00:01:18.490> one<00:01:19.060> way<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.300> show<00:01:19.570> this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
muscle to fire okay one way to show this

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.680 
muscle to fire okay one way to show this

make<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.230> lot<00:02:05.410> more<00:02:05.470> powerful<00:02:05.980> at<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
make you a lot more powerful at the

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.639 
make you a lot more powerful at the
bottom<00:02:06.760> part<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.390> wall<00:02:07.720> ball<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.440> bottom

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
bottom part of the wall ball the bottom

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.779 
bottom part of the wall ball the bottom
part<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> squat<00:02:09.190> for<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.429> wall<00:02:09.580> ball

part of the squat for the wall ball

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.759 
part of the squat for the wall ball
that's<00:02:10.360> what<00:02:10.569> makes<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.869> hand<00:02:11.110> release<00:02:11.349> push<00:02:11.620> up

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
that's what makes a hand release push up

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.259 
that's what makes a hand release push up
significantly<00:02:12.400> harder<00:02:12.760> than<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
significantly harder than it just a

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.360 
significantly harder than it just a
normally<00:02:13.720> push<00:02:14.349> up<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.920> because<00:02:15.129> you're

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
normally push up is because you're

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.890 
normally push up is because you're
loosening<00:02:15.790> you're<00:02:16.269> losing<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:16.689> quick

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
loosening you're losing that quick

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500 
loosening you're losing that quick
stretch<00:02:17.170> at<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.469> bottom<00:02:17.499> of<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:17.890> push-up

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
stretch at the bottom of the push-up

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.119 
stretch at the bottom of the push-up
since<00:02:19.510> we're<00:02:19.749> doing<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.379> split<00:02:20.739> jerk<00:02:20.920> this

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
since we're doing the split jerk this

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.170 
since we're doing the split jerk this
month<00:02:21.400> we<00:02:21.609> wanted<00:02:21.909> to<00:02:21.969> go

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
month we wanted to go

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.819 
month we wanted to go
how<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.390> stretch<00:02:22.629> shortening<00:02:23.200> cycle<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.680> make

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
how the stretch shortening cycle to make

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.380 
how the stretch shortening cycle to make
you<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:23.980> heck<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.430> lot<00:02:24.489> more<00:02:24.549> powerful<00:02:25.030> for

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
you a heck of a lot more powerful for

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.610 
you a heck of a lot more powerful for
the<00:02:25.480> split<00:02:25.810> jerk<00:02:26.019> so<00:02:26.879> Dan<00:02:27.879> pick<00:02:28.209> up<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.480> bar<00:02:28.719> so

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the split jerk so Dan pick up the bar so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
the split jerk so Dan pick up the bar so
Dan<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.159> front<00:02:30.459> rack<00:02:30.640> position<00:02:30.849> we're

Dan in the front rack position we're

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.630 
Dan in the front rack position we're
going<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.599> show<00:02:31.840> how<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.349> stretch<00:02:33.189> shortening

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
going to show how the stretch shortening

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.240 
going to show how the stretch shortening
cycle<00:02:33.879> can<00:02:34.420> significantly<00:02:35.019> improve<00:02:35.560> your

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
cycle can significantly improve your

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.759 
cycle can significantly improve your
ability<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.790> drive<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.359> bar<00:02:37.540> upward<00:02:38.079> you

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
ability to drive the bar upward you

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.640 
ability to drive the bar upward you
might<00:02:38.920> hear<00:02:39.099> your<00:02:39.250> coaches<00:02:39.700> say<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> dip

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
might hear your coaches say do a dip

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.280 
might hear your coaches say do a dip
Drive<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.459> dip<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.480> press<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.109> bar

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
Drive so dip down to press the bar

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.069 
Drive so dip down to press the bar
upward<00:02:44.769> when<00:02:44.980> you're<00:02:45.099> doing<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.840> split<00:02:46.840> jerk

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
upward when you're doing the split jerk

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.500 
upward when you're doing the split jerk
and<00:02:47.349> now<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.730> order<00:02:48.939> to<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.269> stretch

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
and now in order to get that stretch

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.539 
and now in order to get that stretch
shortening<00:02:49.930> cycle<00:02:50.139> to<00:02:50.469> engage<00:02:50.889> those<00:02:51.189> muscle

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549

a quick dip Drive in awesome just like

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.899 
a quick dip Drive in awesome just like
Rick<00:03:00.489> taught<00:03:00.730> him<00:03:00.879> okay<00:03:01.299> come<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.629> back<00:03:01.840> down

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
Rick taught him okay come on back down

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.610 
Rick taught him okay come on back down
now<00:03:03.909> when<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.209> week<00:03:04.359> it's<00:03:04.599> really<00:03:04.659> heavy<00:03:05.200> what

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
now when the week it's really heavy what

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.770 
now when the week it's really heavy what
we<00:03:05.709> tend<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.069> see<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.519> people<00:03:06.849> wanting<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.150> slow

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
we tend to see is people wanting to slow

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.110 
we tend to see is people wanting to slow
down<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.680> dip<00:03:09.010> because<00:03:09.219> it's<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:09.700> heavy

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
down that dip because it's so heavy

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.509 
down that dip because it's so heavy
however<00:03:10.719> that's<00:03:10.989> going<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> make<00:03:11.519> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
however that's going to make that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.490 
however that's going to make that
movement<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:12.969> lot<00:03:13.150> less<00:03:13.450> efficient<00:03:14.109> it's<00:03:14.319> going

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
movement a lot less efficient it's going

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.110 
movement a lot less efficient it's going
to<00:03:14.560> you're<00:03:14.889> not<00:03:15.040> engaging<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.760> stretch

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
to you're not engaging that stretch

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.670 
to you're not engaging that stretch
shortening<00:03:16.540> cycle<00:03:16.959> thus<00:03:17.139> it's<00:03:17.349> not<00:03:17.469> going<00:03:17.620> to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
shortening cycle thus it's not going to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.080 
shortening cycle thus it's not going to
be<00:03:17.739> as<00:03:17.859> powerful<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.370> movements<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:18.879> go<00:03:18.969> ahead

and<00:03:19.180> show<00:03:19.299> us<00:03:19.419> that<00:03:19.569> one<00:03:19.780> day<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.079> shows<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.500> or

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
and show us that one day and shows it or

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.659 
and show us that one day and shows it or
did<00:03:21.700> drive<00:03:22.469> it<00:03:23.469> was<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.620> lot<00:03:23.859> less<00:03:24.040> powerful

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
did drive it was a lot less powerful

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.719 
did drive it was a lot less powerful
because<00:03:25.389> that<00:03:26.379> dip<00:03:26.620> wasn't<00:03:27.099> didn't<00:03:27.489> give<00:03:27.609> them

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:27.729 
because that dip wasn't didn't give them

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:29.879

that<00:03:27.879> quick<00:03:28.120> velocity<00:03:28.659> stretch<00:03:28.930> okay<00:03:29.139> so<00:03:29.739> just

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
that quick velocity stretch okay so just

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.750 
that quick velocity stretch okay so just
one<00:03:30.040> more<00:03:30.069> time<00:03:30.250> quick<00:03:30.849> dip<00:03:31.060> drive<00:03:31.359> will<00:03:31.750> show

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
one more time quick dip drive will show

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
one more time quick dip drive will show
just<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.090> engage<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.540> stretch

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
just like to engage that stretch

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.699 
just like to engage that stretch
torquing<00:03:35.199> cycle<00:03:36.150> perfect<00:03:37.209> so<00:03:37.900> bottom<00:03:38.139> line<00:03:38.290> a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
quick stretch to a muscle makes it fire

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.679 
quick stretch to a muscle makes it fire
more<00:03:41.199> powerfully<00:03:41.859> so<00:03:42.489> apply<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.659> your

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
more powerfully so apply that to your

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.050 
more powerfully so apply that to your
split<00:03:44.049> jerk<00:03:44.290> this<00:03:44.500> month<00:03:44.829> give<00:03:45.669> it<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.819> quick

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
split jerk this month give it a quick

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.699 
split jerk this month give it a quick
dip<00:03:46.329> rather<00:03:46.659> than<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.019> slow<00:03:47.319> dip<00:03:47.530> and

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
dip rather than that slow dip and
