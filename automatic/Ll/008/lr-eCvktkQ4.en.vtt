 what is not on the side of the level 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.869
 Russian government 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.890
 such problems are difficult to solve either 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.689
 generally can not be solved according 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.279
 with current legislation because 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.790
 of the year 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.090
 these powers are transferred to the street and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 set it on firek killed but on line 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.969
 steam and not on russia which has 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.129
 controlling stake 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.770
 in almost all regions and municipalities 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.450
 this can and should be done by the chairman 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.070
 Supreme Council of United Russia Boris 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.410
 Gryzlov told how to solve 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 problems of lack of kindergarten places on 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.579
 modernization of preschool institutions 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.780
 funds are allocated while small around 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.879
 500 million rubles 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.000
 new types of equipment appeared 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.770
 for example in the bed transformers and the same 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.309
 the rooms that were previously 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.310
 used for bedrooms and others for 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.350
 rooms where children can relax 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.540
 merge into one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 small 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.830
 the task we solved but she 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.620
 allowed by several tens of thousands 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.270
 increase the number of seats there is x she is 59 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.760
 ends now and now children 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.830
 sleep here on such iron bunk 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.170
 beds honestly they don't look 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.990
 very convenient whether the girl well show how 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.670
 you get out of bed 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 how do you do it i tried 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.780
 fold one such bed to understand 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.479
 how do they make a teacher and honestly 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.460
 saying the load is obtained as in 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.400
 the gym on this good 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.890
 simulator and here's another version of the old 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.259
 type such here three-tier not that here 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 here one child sleeps here 2 here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.580
 here 3 how much space does it take 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.170
 every bed like this is fine 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.420
 new furniture that appeared here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 just recently but on a contract and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.869
 going to flick times and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 all this helps me 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.040
 Nadezhda Grigorievna, garden manager 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.050
 beznosyuk put on gregoria and in 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.230
 the rest is better than this furniture old 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.239
 This furniture is certainly different 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.209
 from the old due to these beds 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.440
 we were able to increase the number of children 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.980
 places in groups 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.370
 well for 10 people in each group if 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.739
 Norm 20 then we now have id 30v each 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.500
 each house is 50 percent 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.870
 garden can accommodate more well 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.090
 practically until although it is additional 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.860
 load on what is already quite serious 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.180
 They say that such furniture can be found 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.130
 new places in kindergartens 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.110
 just build new pretty gardens 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.720
 expensive to provide a place for one 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.820
 child needs one million rubles here in 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.739
 this group of 30 children is already 30 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.750
 million and to completely turn 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.100
 disappeared need not much not enough annual 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.100
 the budget of the Stavropol Krai 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.540
 Well
