00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
general nazgrim some reason I don't know

why but general nazgrim on flexi level

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
why but general nazgrim on flexi level
of<00:00:45.149> difficulty<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.140> ridiculously<00:00:46.860> easy

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
of difficulty is just ridiculously easy

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.270 
of difficulty is just ridiculously easy
but<00:00:47.670> maybe<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:49.410> due<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.950> fact<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
but maybe that's due to the fact that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.910 
but maybe that's due to the fact that
when<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> cooperate<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.110> other<00:00:52.320> people<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
when you cooperate with other people and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
when you cooperate with other people and
you<00:00:53.370> understand<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.539> role<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.809> within

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.690 
way that I could do this now would be
through<00:01:54.450> raid<00:01:54.960> finder<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
through raid finder that would be it and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.389 
through raid finder that would be it and
then<00:01:56.969> getting<00:01:57.719> gear<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.409> valor<00:01:58.740> points<00:01:59.009> on

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
then getting gear with valor points on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.330 
then getting gear with valor points on
top<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.909> from<00:02:00.240> vendors<00:02:00.689> etc<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:02.189> there

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
top of that from vendors etc but there

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.200 
top of that from vendors etc but there
are<00:02:02.460> no<00:02:02.670> valla<00:02:03.630> vendors<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.380> patch<00:02:04.649> 5.4<00:02:05.369> yeah

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
are no valla vendors in patch 5.4 yeah

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.940 
are no valla vendors in patch 5.4 yeah
you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> only<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:06.990> your<00:02:07.140> gear<00:02:07.350> through<00:02:07.680> time

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you can only get your gear through time

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.580 
you can only get your gear through time
with<00:02:08.129> silent<00:02:08.520> burdens<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.910> eternity<00:02:09.590> butthole

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.699 
flexi level of difficulty really tree
to<00:02:13.859> me<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.689> tested<00:02:15.689> it<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.200> first<00:02:16.409> week

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
to me I tested it out on the first week

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.490 
to me I tested it out on the first week
of<00:02:16.859> release<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.030> loved<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.930> love<00:02:19.349> to

eat suited me absolutely perfectly I got

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.369 
eat suited me absolutely perfectly I got
a<00:02:24.329> level<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.319> difficulty<00:02:25.879> which<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.299> could<00:02:28.109> do

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
a level of difficulty which I could do

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.610 
a level of difficulty which I could do
without<00:02:29.060> been<00:02:30.060> perfectly<00:02:30.659> not<00:02:31.109> too<00:02:31.319> much

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
without been perfectly not too much

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.709 
without been perfectly not too much
difficulty<00:02:32.129> at<00:02:32.400> all<00:02:32.579> you<00:02:32.790> know<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:32.939> can<00:02:33.389> play<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
difficulty at all you know I can play to

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.039 
difficulty at all you know I can play to
much<00:02:34.079> higher<00:02:34.769> standard<00:02:35.370> than<00:02:35.400> then<00:02:36.269> flexi<00:02:36.840> but

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
much higher standard than then flexi but

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.589 
much higher standard than then flexi but
at<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> same<00:02:37.469> time<00:02:37.829> what<00:02:38.639> made<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.090> really

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
at the same time what made it really

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.479 
at the same time what made it really
interesting<00:02:40.260> was<00:02:40.379> you<00:02:40.560> still<00:02:40.859> had<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.159> be<00:02:41.250> part

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
interesting was you still had to be part

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.030 
interesting was you still had to be part
of<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.939> group<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.359> people<00:02:42.540> who<00:02:43.200> although<00:02:43.500> they

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
of a group of people who although they

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.379 
of a group of people who although they
may<00:02:44.189> not<00:02:44.400> know<00:02:44.609> each<00:02:44.760> other<00:02:44.969> because<00:02:45.239> they're

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
may not know each other because they're

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.080 
may not know each other because they're
a<00:02:45.420> pug<00:02:45.720> group<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.889> be<00:02:47.040> coordinated<00:02:47.489> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
a pug group have to be coordinated and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.229 
a pug group have to be coordinated and
have<00:02:48.389> to<00:02:48.629> work<00:02:48.780> as<00:02:49.049> a<00:02:49.079> unit<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:50.430> succeed<00:02:50.939> if<00:02:51.120> you

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
have to work as a unit to succeed if you

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.960 
have to work as a unit to succeed if you
don't<00:02:51.569> work<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.019> unit<00:02:52.109> in<00:02:52.530> flexi<00:02:53.040> rating<00:02:53.400> you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
don't work as a unit in flexi rating you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.360 
don't work as a unit in flexi rating you
will<00:02:54.180> fail<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.810> was<00:02:55.590> really<00:02:56.099> really

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
will fail and that was really really

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.179 
will fail and that was really really
attractive<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.269> me<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.629> although<00:02:57.930> i<00:02:58.049> know<00:02:58.590> that

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
attractive to me so although i know that

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.440 
attractive to me so although i know that
i<00:02:59.219> could<00:02:59.549> probably<00:02:59.730> play<00:02:59.939> to<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.209> higher

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
i could probably play to a higher

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030 
i could probably play to a higher
standard<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.319> lot<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.709> people

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
standard and a lot of the people

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.309 
standard and a lot of the people
probably<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.489> here<00:03:02.730> could<00:03:03.389> play<00:03:03.689> to<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.079> higher

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
probably in here could play to a higher

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.920 
probably in here could play to a higher
standard<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:05.129> was<00:03:05.579> great<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.269> we<00:03:06.419> still<00:03:06.689> had

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
standard it was great that we still had

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.750 
standard it was great that we still had
