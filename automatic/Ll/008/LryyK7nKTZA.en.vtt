pretty<00:02:53.660> soon<00:02:53.690> they're<00:02:53.990> wanting<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.320> turn

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
pretty soon they're wanting to turn

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.990 
pretty soon they're wanting to turn
their<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.100> little<00:02:55.310> bit<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.520> faster

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
their up a little bit a faster

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.660 
their up a little bit a faster
acceleration<00:02:56.300> speed<00:02:57.040> faster<00:02:58.040> turning<00:02:58.430> speed

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
acceleration speed faster turning speed

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.660 
acceleration speed faster turning speed
backward<00:02:59.600> speed<00:02:59.930> is<00:03:00.170> all<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.440> way<00:03:00.530> up<00:03:00.740> and<00:03:00.980> my

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
backward speed is all the way up and my

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.900 
backward speed is all the way up and my
acceleration<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.570> 21<00:03:03.500> french<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.520> i<00:03:04.550> started

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
acceleration is 21 french so i started

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.880 
acceleration is 21 french so i started
in<00:03:04.970> France<00:03:05.920> almost<00:03:06.920> 20<00:03:07.160> years<00:03:07.250> ago<00:03:07.400> when<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.360> was

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
been playing for about seven or eight

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.250 
been playing for about seven or eight
years<00:03:16.430> when<00:03:17.180> they<00:03:17.750> first<00:03:17.990> told<00:03:18.080> me<00:03:18.200> about

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
years when they first told me about

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.990 
years when they first told me about
power<00:03:18.620> soccer<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.040> was<00:03:19.160> just<00:03:19.280> like<00:03:19.460> I<00:03:19.730> was

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
power soccer I was just like I was

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.250 
power soccer I was just like I was
probably<00:03:20.360> just<00:03:20.480> one<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.660> those<00:03:20.780> sports<00:03:21.080> that

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
probably just one of those sports that

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.070 
probably just one of those sports that
everybody<00:03:21.860> wins<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.580> once<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.210> played<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.900> was

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
everybody wins and once I played it was

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.570 
everybody wins and once I played it was
it<00:03:24.380> was<00:03:24.530> different<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.070> didn't<00:03:25.310> think<00:03:25.400> you

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
it was different I didn't think you

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.710 
it was different I didn't think you
would<00:03:25.640> actually<00:03:26.000> get<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.210> adrenaline<00:03:26.480> rush

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
would actually get the adrenaline rush

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.210 
would actually get the adrenaline rush
and<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.020> competitive<00:03:27.500> nature<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.950> he<00:03:28.040> did

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
and the competitive nature that he did

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.030 
and the competitive nature that he did
just<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.880> competitive<00:03:29.600> edge<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.260> fact<00:03:30.920> that

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
just the competitive edge the fact that

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.110 
just the competitive edge the fact that
you<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.370> get<00:03:31.490> out<00:03:31.640> there<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:31.940> compete

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
you can get out there and compete

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.810 
you can get out there and compete
against<00:03:32.870> other<00:03:33.080> players<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.890> said<00:03:34.220> I<00:03:34.250> want<00:03:34.670> you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
against other players I said I want you

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.430 
against other players I said I want you
really<00:03:34.970> really<00:03:35.210> pretty<00:03:35.480> bad<00:03:35.720> for<00:03:35.960> that<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.230> want

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
really really pretty bad for that I want

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.010 
really really pretty bad for that I want
to<00:03:37.100> do<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.730> best<00:03:37.880> that<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.150> can<00:03:38.210> it's<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.840> lot

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
to do the best that I can it's a lot

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.900 
to do the best that I can it's a lot
different<00:03:39.230> than<00:03:39.650> how<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:39.980> normally<00:03:40.130> use<00:03:40.550> my

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
different than how I normally use my

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.970 
different than how I normally use my
chair<00:03:41.180> for<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.600> first<00:03:41.930> time<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.380> just<00:03:42.650> do

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
chair for the first time you just do

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.550 
chair for the first time you just do
something<00:03:43.400> different<00:03:44.300> when<00:03:44.930> your<00:03:45.080> power<00:03:45.230> chip

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
something different when your power chip

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.220 
something different when your power chip
