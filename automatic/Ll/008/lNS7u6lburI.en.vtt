00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.320
 the easiest to change icons is not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.140
 items we need these flash 3 to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.060
 activity and items own laws 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.160
 its subject here with us is not all 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.110
 items and let's say 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.520
 we all move forward honestly 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.570
 already changed race 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.879
 see what we say dislike for 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.340
 this we go let's say we press 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.120
 change and 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 I have it somehow 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.770
 mercedes 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.860
 so you hug me at all without a difference 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 when something of paint on road accidents 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:05.309
 involving furniture as i leave as is 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.210
 how to change the cursor and change cursors 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.210
 i find 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 also pretty just go to 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.130
 the cursor and I have already changed here for this 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.780
 go your at birth record in the lock 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.080
 let's say we like such a cursor and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 so we throw him they taught me 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.880
 throw here and all 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.170
 stew all demonstrate backlog 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 dota 2 copy 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 go here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.860
 do not put all the files should actually 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.790
 and because 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:54.900
 everything is changing well, let's say now 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:58.210
 let's see and now more interesting 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.869
 we go actually. 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.909
 then you need all seven by the way if 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.700
 losing an ordinary piece suggest you 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.090
 create a folder and something there 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.650
 create throw off ordinary 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.830
 ordinary cursors for this law 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.069
 press the library does not immediately play 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.360
 push based startup option 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:27.099
 we enter this into the console which command 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.060
 which allows us to power block so 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.300
 here after dota 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.300
 now 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.590
 download now 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 perhaps wind barrels and a little bit to the right 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.100
 later boot yes wait there so 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.850
 right here 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.850
 booted up 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 multi loud so 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.440
 I 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:12.820
 shots in the window and let's go in 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.220
 lobby create a lope then the difference here 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.790
 much 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.830
 tactics oncoming which is over and all on 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.830
 place and personally 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.160
 getting started 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.720
 actually play 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.470
 yes now we will begin 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.470
 we had a family 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
 and see change or cursor I'm 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.210
 I hope that I will change 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.210
 but 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.880
 we have to recreate again but 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.770
 because I have already used such 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.160
 cursor move cursor but this cursor is not 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.160
 that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.000
 as 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.840
 they press 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.510
 as 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.000
 okay 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.000
 for this we remove the cursor 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.050
 let's see yes see that all this is me 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.940
 changed 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.110
 before creating you need a or under 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.110
 just reconnect 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.430
 and actually should change 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:33.560
 icons should not change to normal 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:40.280

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:45.700
 changed everything has changed now with us 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.290
