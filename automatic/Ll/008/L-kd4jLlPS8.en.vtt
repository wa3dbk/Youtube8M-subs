 ok let's give this what can 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.240
 leave so ok I know the route where it's going to 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.460
 install the game myself in my case is 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.310
 optional or that I'm going to change it 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.890
 because I do not want to fill that hard drive 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.110
 but I will put here on the local disk 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.260
 of 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.240
 let's give it in next let's give 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.240
 the next six and install 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.639
 well one thing that I did not see them he did not 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:20.389
 had said is that the game weighs 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.780
 around 7 and if we are going to see 7 gigas 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.319
 with 35 megs ok the game is a bit heavy 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.139
 but it's worth it because it 's a very game 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.090
 good ok very good I recommend them to 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.219
 everyone who sees here I'm going to put a 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.680
 small pause since I do not want to do 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.650
 this very long video tutorial we're going 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.110
 to put a good pause since it's 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.830
 finishing the installation well you have already 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.160
 finished 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.230
 complete the installation if we do not have 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.930
 installed none of this on our pc 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.880
 let's check all these boxes and the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.700
 based on finish to install 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.560
 that this is if you do not have it even though I 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.800
 my case I already have it so I'm not going to 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.540
 do but remember if you do not have it 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 do it because if not the game is not going 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.370
 to work well let's give it in finish 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.740
 and now what we are going to do is go to 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.690
 next step that is to create the game 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.820
 well for this we are going to enter here this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.860
 folder that crack and we're going to copy 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.050
 these two files we are going to give in copy 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.480
 we can close that without any 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.730
 problem like this and we go here to 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.390
 game icon will right click 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:30.600
 and open the file location and well 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.780
 here we are going to give you the blank 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.480
 here we will give Paste let 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.249
 check this box and we will give it in 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.439
 copy and replace 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:43.529
 Now what we are going to do is open this 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:46.399
 file that says stand up and 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:50.519
 and let's go down to the bottom and go to 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:54.239
 here where it says language says English 

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:57.119
 let's put spanish and let's lock 

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:59.039
 to keep and keep well those who do not 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.960
 you want to keep them that always happens 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.789
 the case 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.460
 you just have to save here in the 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.699
 desk and then move it here 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.729
 ok they give him to move and review already with this 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.849
 let's have our full game let's 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.370
