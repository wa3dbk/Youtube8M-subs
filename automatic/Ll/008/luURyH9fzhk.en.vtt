00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hey guys welcome to a feedback lesson I

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey guys welcome to a feedback lesson I
want<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.179> show<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.389> real<00:00:03.629> quick<00:00:03.899> how<00:00:04.110> to

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
want to show you real quick how to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.950 
want to show you real quick how to
create<00:00:04.620> control<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.700> manipulate<00:00:06.420> feedback

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
create control and manipulate feedback

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.280 
create control and manipulate feedback
at<00:00:07.230> will<00:00:08.120> let<00:00:09.120> me<00:00:09.210> first<00:00:09.420> define<00:00:09.660> feedback

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
at will let me first define feedback

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.799 
at will let me first define feedback
though<00:00:10.500> what<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> feedback<00:00:11.509> feedback<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.780> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
though what is feedback feedback is a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.350 
though what is feedback feedback is a
simple<00:00:13.230> situation<00:00:13.440> where<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.759> volume<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
simple situation where the volume of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.480 
simple situation where the volume of
your<00:00:15.389> amplifier<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> cranked<00:00:17.100> up<00:00:17.220> loud<00:00:17.460> enough

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
your amplifier is cranked up loud enough

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640 
your amplifier is cranked up loud enough
that<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.480> sound<00:00:18.779> coming<00:00:19.199> out<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
that the sound coming out of the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.310 
that the sound coming out of the
speaker's<00:00:20.119> resonates<00:00:21.119> through<00:00:21.810> your<00:00:21.990> guitar

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
speaker's resonates through your guitar

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.859 
speaker's resonates through your guitar
and<00:00:22.560> vibrates<00:00:23.369> your<00:00:23.609> strings<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> were

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and vibrates your strings as if you were

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.980 
and vibrates your strings as if you were
picking<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.619> playing<00:00:26.010> them<00:00:26.220> yourself

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
picking them or playing them yourself

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.230 
picking them or playing them yourself
thus<00:00:27.990> creating<00:00:28.619> kind<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> cycle<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.880> sound

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
thus creating kind of a cycle of sound

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
thus creating kind of a cycle of sound
or<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> circle<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> sound<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:32.160> would<00:00:32.550> never

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
or a circle of sound that would never

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.990 
or a circle of sound that would never
end<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:34.050> never<00:00:34.380> muted<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> strings<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:35.880> if

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
end if you never muted the strings or if

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240 
end if you never muted the strings or if
you<00:00:36.180> never<00:00:37.050> turn<00:00:37.350> down<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.800> volume<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.219> your

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
you never turn down the volume of your

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
you never turn down the volume of your
guitar<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:38.940> turn<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> volume<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.170> your

guitar or turn down the volume of your

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.610 
guitar or turn down the volume of your
amp<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:41.100> basically<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.960> how

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
amp that's basically what it is now how

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860 
amp that's basically what it is now how
can<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.980> create<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.670> how<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> control<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
can you create it how can you control it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
can you create it how can you control it
and<00:00:45.989> wield<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.789> three<00:00:47.789> easy<00:00:48.030> steps<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and wield it three easy steps to that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.619 
and wield it three easy steps to that
number<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> volume<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> have

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
number one is volume you got to have

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
number one is volume you got to have
your<00:00:51.809> amp<00:00:52.140> cranked<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.280> app<00:00:53.460> the

volume of your amplifier is not turned
up<00:00:55.710> loud<00:00:55.890> enough<00:00:55.949> you're<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
up loud enough you're not going to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.170 
up loud enough you're not going to
achieve<00:00:57.270> feedback<00:00:58.230> number<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.940> one's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
achieve feedback number two this one's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
achieve feedback number two this one's
kind<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.719> rule<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> thumb<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> law

kind of a rule of thumb but not a law

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.960 
kind of a rule of thumb but not a law
and<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.090> use<00:01:03.539> Distortion<00:01:04.409> um<00:01:04.909> yeah<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and that is use Distortion um yeah you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.210 
and that is use Distortion um yeah you
can<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.630> clean<00:01:06.960> tone<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.040> may

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
can get it with clean tone but you may

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.789 
can get it with clean tone but you may
be<00:01:08.250> wrestling<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> if
