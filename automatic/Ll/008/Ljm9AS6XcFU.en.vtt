00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.550
 I really enjoyed the many 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.230
 as budget year the various molds of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.960
 those t shirts or chiffon shirts 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.669
 printed with maybe trouser suit is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 then loved the pants 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.440
 the one with a savannah print 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.300
 if so you can 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.540
 define and then there was also a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.730
 other 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.760
 a suit of chanel say with a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 jacket very pretty as the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.130
 matching miniskirt that came out while 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.330
 among the last on the white on the shades 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.310
 of white 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.980
 these data are what I am 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.050
 however in general I liked them 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.030
 fan that the combinations just between the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.860
 various rooms that boats that did it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.860
 stylist was really good 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 where is it 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.940
 the elegant something as innate as it is 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.190
 style is something that everyone 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.950
 but he said he personalizes each of 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.860
 we can choose a head of the 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 collection touches and do it on 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.450
 then 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.950
 elegant 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.740
 but at the same time an accomplice point 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.930
 that elegance not secondary something 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.990
 launch point that each of us now 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 Well 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.770
 it can be refined over time though 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.040
 do not buy because 1 1 is not present 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.530
 therefore he has it 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:57.220
 I fully agree with the new one 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.830
 coca philosophy well in my case they are 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.510
 in close contact because without them 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.400
 there wouldn't be my blog 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.550
 many fashion houses would not have that 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.500
 success in social networks on the internet 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.140
 as instead now lately 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.870
 they therefore have their own brand 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.940
 registered on twitter facebook instagram 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.230
 now it goes into the fundamentals then 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.600
 you have to keep updating yourself 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.390
 because according to me then those years 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.880
 new social networks will be born 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.680
 fundamentals that followers of the more you are 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.810
 powers in quotation marks, however, be careful with 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.850
 don't buy them I don't like things 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 silicone-coated I am not silicone or not 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.140
 I have nothing bought on everyone 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.200
 already me
