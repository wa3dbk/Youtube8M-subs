part that you're balancing the ball line
parallel<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:38.719> balls<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.230> for

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
parallel to balls gonna be good for

00:00:40.379 --> 00:01:27.910 
parallel to balls gonna be good for
health

it there the forehead wrinkles make it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.830 
it there the forehead wrinkles make it
easier<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.700> ball<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:41.209> stay<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.659> your

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
easier for the ball to stay on your

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.250 
easier for the ball to stay on your

parallel

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.970 

for<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.420> temple<00:02:52.720> stall<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.290> feel<00:02:53.500> this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
for the temple stall you can feel this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.710 
for the temple stall you can feel this
kind<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.250> indentation<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.270> side<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.480> your

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
kind of indentation on the side of your

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.890 
kind of indentation on the side of your
face<00:02:55.840> above<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.890> cheekbone<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.900> right

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
face above the cheekbone and right

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.980 
face above the cheekbone and right
behind<00:02:59.200> your<00:03:00.010> eyebrow<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.820> that's<00:03:01.720> where<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
behind your eyebrow and that's where the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.870 
behind your eyebrow and that's where the
ball<00:03:02.140> goes<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.860> set<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.130> right<00:03:03.160> there<00:03:03.490> and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
ball goes just set it right there and

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.420 
ball goes just set it right there and
lean<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> side<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.620> don't<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.160> leave

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
lean to the side and don't just leave

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.540 
lean to the side and don't just leave
your<00:03:06.460> head<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:06.910> lean<00:03:07.060> your<00:03:07.180> whole<00:03:07.420> body<00:03:08.550> maybe

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
your head and lean your whole body maybe

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:24.339 
your head and lean your whole body maybe
once<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> feels<00:03:10.180> now

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.660 

so<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.590> top<00:03:25.769> of<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.950> head<00:03:26.099> has<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.340> kind<00:03:26.579> of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
so the top of the head has a kind of

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.899 
so the top of the head has a kind of
line<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:28.019> goes<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.530> front<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.700> then

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
line it goes to the front of it and then

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.130 
line it goes to the front of it and then
a<00:03:30.060> slight<00:03:30.510> slant<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:32.129> slightly<00:03:32.930> from<00:03:33.930> each

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
a slight slant down slightly from each

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.319 
a slight slant down slightly from each
side<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.099> is<00:03:35.489> where<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.849> can<00:03:36.000> dump<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
side and that is where you can dump the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.349 
side and that is where you can dump the
ball<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.140> tilt<00:03:37.379> your<00:03:37.439> head<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
ball so you tilt your head and it

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.270 
ball so you tilt your head and it
becomes<00:03:39.659> a<00:03:39.780> flatter<00:03:40.049> point<00:03:40.349> then<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.129> can

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
becomes a flatter point then you can

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.920 
becomes a flatter point then you can
balance<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.670> on<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.569> do<00:03:42.659> it<00:03:42.689> on<00:03:42.810> either

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
balance it on you can do it on either

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.210 
balance it on you can do it on either
side<00:03:43.290> working<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.890> middle

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
side working the middle

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.339 
side working the middle
it's<00:03:44.819> useful<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.359> trick<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:46.200> look

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
it's useful in this trick to just look

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.479 
it's useful in this trick to just look
in<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.530> mirror<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:48.060> set<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.659> ball<00:03:48.810> there<00:03:49.489> so

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
in a mirror and set the ball there so

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.679 
in a mirror and set the ball there so
find<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.819> spot<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.389> you're<00:03:51.450> going<00:03:51.659> to

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
find that spot that you're going to

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.820 
find that spot that you're going to
balance<00:03:51.989> it

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
balance it

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.170 
balance it
set<00:03:54.830> ball

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.089 

and<00:03:57.629> check<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:57.959> pulse<00:03:58.260> from<00:03:58.769> either<00:03:58.950> side
