you<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.430> prediction<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.180> sits<00:00:54.510> out

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
you have your prediction that sits out

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
you have your prediction that sits out
the<00:00:54.870> entire<00:00:55.350> time<00:00:55.880> so<00:00:56.880> here<00:00:57.060> we<00:00:57.150> go<00:00:57.300> see<00:00:58.200> oh

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
the entire time so here we go see oh

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.469 
the entire time so here we go see oh
f<00:01:00.740> f/a<00:01:01.740> e<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> tell<00:01:05.549> them<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.880> remove<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.499 
f f/a e so you tell them to remove the
water<00:01:06.719> and<00:01:08.299> you're<00:01:09.299> sensing<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.070> their

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
water and you're sensing that their

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.950 
water and you're sensing that their
selection<00:01:12.509> is<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.880> rum<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.450> remove<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
selection is not on rum so remove the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.480 
selection is not on rum so remove the
rum<00:01:16.140> card<00:01:17.539> next<00:01:18.539> have<00:01:19.350> them<00:01:19.590> move<00:01:19.859> up<00:01:20.219> or<00:01:20.429> down

you'll also need a prediction for your

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.000 
you'll also need a prediction for your
first<00:02:38.000> effect<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:40.100> says<00:02:40.430> sprite<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.770> you'll

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010
