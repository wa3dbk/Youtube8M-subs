00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.550 
start with basic version try to progress
the<00:03:48.280> most<00:03:48.460> advanced<00:03:48.850> version<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.240> well<00:03:49.530> let<00:03:50.530> me

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
the most advanced version as well let me

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.390 
the most advanced version as well let me
just<00:03:50.800> show<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.130> few<00:03:51.810> back-to-back<00:03:52.810> your

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
just show you a few back-to-back your

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:20.880 
just show you a few back-to-back your
intensity<00:03:54.400> level<00:04:17.820> that's<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.000> Burpee<00:04:19.890> you

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
intensity level that's the Burpee you

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.340 
intensity level that's the Burpee you
also<00:04:21.040> seen<00:04:21.570> sometimes<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:26.050> real<00:04:26.200> need<00:04:26.320> to

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
also seen sometimes just a real need to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.810 
also seen sometimes just a real need to
finish<00:04:26.560> off<00:04:26.830> strong

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.390 

but<00:04:31.440> loading<00:04:32.440> this<00:04:32.620> move<00:04:32.920> you're<00:04:33.070> gonna<00:04:33.160> see<00:04:33.370> a

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
but loading this move you're gonna see a

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.940 
but loading this move you're gonna see a
lot<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.410> it's<00:04:35.410> probably<00:04:35.590> one<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.830> the

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
lot of it and it's probably one of the

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.640 
lot of it and it's probably one of the
worst<00:04:36.150> exercises<00:04:37.150> you'll<00:04:37.450> do<00:04:37.630> but<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
worst exercises you'll do but the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.580 
worst exercises you'll do but the
general<00:04:39.130> rule<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.340> thumb<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:41.169> harder<00:04:41.500> an

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
general rule of thumb the harder an

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.940 
general rule of thumb the harder an
exercise<00:04:42.070> is<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.810> morning<00:04:44.169> who<00:04:44.320> want<00:04:44.890> to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
exercise is in the morning who want to

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.770 
exercise is in the morning who want to
avoid<00:04:45.130> probably<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.820> more<00:04:46.030> it's<00:04:46.630> going<00:04:46.720> to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
avoid probably the more it's going to

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.950 
avoid probably the more it's going to
give<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:48.040> keep<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.490> mind<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
give you so keep that in mind the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.420 
give you so keep that in mind the
workout<00:04:50.350> should<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:50.620> just<00:04:50.800> that<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:51.190> should<00:04:51.310> be

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
workout should be just that it should be

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.390 
workout should be just that it should be
work<00:04:51.640> and<00:04:52.650> if<00:04:53.650> you're<00:04:53.830> doing<00:04:53.919> stuff<00:04:54.220> that<00:04:54.250> you
