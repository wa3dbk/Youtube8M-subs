we're<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> hear<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> vox<00:00:39.239> ac30<00:00:39.780> model

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we're going to hear is a vox ac30 model

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:58.660 
we're going to hear is a vox ac30 model
with<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.010> compression<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.640> reverb

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.310

and<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:20.570> gets<00:01:20.750> us<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.110> mesa/boogie<00:01:21.290> model

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
and that gets us to a mesa/boogie model

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:44.590 
and that gets us to a mesa/boogie model
with<00:01:22.550> a<00:01:22.580> little<00:01:22.850> bit<00:01:22.940> of<00:01:23.000> reverb
