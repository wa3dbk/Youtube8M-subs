00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 i 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.850
 hello everyone welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.680
 parties my name stanley and the day of 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.810
 today first do together and controls of 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.030
 cinnamon are super easy to make and 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.980
 the preparation is also very rich 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.740
 is approximately two hours and the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.030
 cooking time is 35 to 40 minutes 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.030
 I hope this recipe 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.220
 The ingredients for this recipe are 3 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.100
 cups flour 1 and 14 cups 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.380
 chopped walnuts 2/3 cup honey 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.830
 Maple a quarter cup of sugar 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.550
 granulated half a cup of brown sugar a 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.070
 11 gram fast yeast package 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.500
 a teaspoon of salt 8 tablespoons of 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.580
 butter at room temperature 1 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.280
 egg 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.739
 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon and one 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.260
 cup of warm water the water should be 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.510
 from 50 to 55 degrees centigrade let's start 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.700
 We are going to grease a mold or tray 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.850
 rectangular with 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.540
 butter the mold should measure between 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.730
 33 x 22 centimeters on the butter 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.260
 let's add the chopped walnut and honey 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.810
 of maple 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.120
 make sure this mixture covers very 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.360
 well the bottom of the mold and reserve the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.040
 mold until you're ready to use it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.500
 now in a large bowl combines two 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.960
 cups of flour with a quarter cup of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.630
 granulated sugar a teaspoon of salt 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.650
 and a pack of 11 grams of yeast 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.630
 fast 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.040
 mix everything well so that everything is 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.170
 Incorporate and then add warm water 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.690
 Continue mixing and add 2 tablespoons 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.760
 of butter is very important that the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.710
 butter is at room temperature 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.750
 to give the dough the texture 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.300
 perfect because if the butter is 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 cold the dough will be very hard mix 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.659
 well for everything to be incorporated and adds 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.700
 egg 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.250
 you can continue mixing with a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.110
 fork 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.090
 but at this point I recommend that 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 start mixing everything with your hands 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.900
 I'm going to put on some gloves and I'm going to 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.940
 mix everything very well until all 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.720
 the ingredients are incorporated in 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.670
 a dough that will be somewhat sticky since 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.459
 the ingredients are incorporated in 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.340
 a sticky mass now let's add 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.959
 one more cup of flour and we're going to 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.640
 continue working the dough with 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.850
 our hands until everything is 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.740
 incorporated in a smooth and elastic dough 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.530
 this point the mass should no longer be 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.900
 not sticky at all since the dough has 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.850
 the correct texture now covers the with 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.450
 a clean towel or a bag of 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.520
 plastic and let it stand for 30 to 40 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.530
 minutes for the yeast to start 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.840
 do his job 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.930
 in a small bowl combine the sugar 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.060
 brunette with ground cinnamon mixes well 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.870
 and book until you're ready to 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.870
 use this mixture 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.650
 after 30 or 40 minutes the mass is 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.540
 must have risen to double now in 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.549
 a floured surface we are going to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.349
 extend the mass giving it shape 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.110
 rectangular with a thickness of one 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.129
 centimeter since you have the rectangle 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.690
 ready 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.970
 Now we are going to varnish all the 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.950
 surface of the rectangle with the 4 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.140
 spoonfuls of butter that we have 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.329
 left over as long as you covered the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.459
 surface with butter now 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.069
 sprinkle the brown sugar mixture and 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.709
 the cinnamon on the butter on the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.109
 rectangle starting with the most 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.720
 long rectangle let's roll it up 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.420
 slowly so that it is tight 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.790
 since the roll is completely 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.580
 rolled now we 're going to cut it in 16 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.800
 pieces and we will place them in the mold or 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.010
 in the rectangular tray that is already 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.420
 prepared with maple nut and honey 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.610
 we are going to place a towel on the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.600
 rolls and we'll let them rest by 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.600
 30 more minutes 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.960
 Now preheat the oven to 190 degrees 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.720
 centigrade 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.760
 after 30 to 40 minutes now yes of 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.490
 be in the rolls and they will realize 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.860
 that have been inflated a little now it is 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.560
 time to bake we're going to bake them 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.780
 at 190 degrees centigrade for 30 minutes 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.600
 or until they are somewhat golden and well 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.370
 cooked and that's it after the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.680
 rolls come out of the oven we're going to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.690
 let stand for a minute and then 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.200
 we are going to transfer them to a surface 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.200
 cool 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.940
