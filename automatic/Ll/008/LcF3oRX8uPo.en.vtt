and the way and when they get there

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.740 
and the way and when they get there
they're<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.880> websites<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> data

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
they're the websites into the data

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
they're the websites into the data
center<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.170> begin<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.439> categorize<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> data

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
center they begin to categorize the data

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
center they begin to categorize the data
assess<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.450> ranking<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
assess it for ranking and then the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
assess it for ranking and then the
update<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> data<00:01:46.920> centers<00:01:47.220> with<00:01:47.460> there

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
update all the data centers with there

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.340 
update all the data centers with there
with<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> different<00:01:49.200> ways<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
with all of the different ways that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
with all of the different ways that
they've<00:01:49.649> categorized<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> data<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.240> let<00:01:51.360> me

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they've categorized the data so let me

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.870 
they've categorized the data so let me
just<00:01:51.600> talk<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> here's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> chart<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just talk this is a here's a chart of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.420 
just talk this is a here's a chart of
how<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.180> exactly<00:01:54.990> how<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.200> works<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
how this exactly how this works so the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.069 
how this exactly how this works so the
way<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.850> its<00:01:57.060> index<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.630> starts<00:01:57.899> with

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
way it's like its index it starts with

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.170 
way it's like its index it starts with
Google<00:01:58.530> Google<00:01:59.100> sends<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.909> search

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
Google Google sends out the search

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.200 
Google Google sends out the search
engine<00:02:00.540> spiders<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.729> come

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
engine spiders and and then they come

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.289 
engine spiders and and then they come
across<00:02:03.420> some<00:02:04.020> web<00:02:04.200> site<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:05.180> let's<00:02:06.180> say

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
across some web site so let's say

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.429 
across some web site so let's say
there's<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.600> website<00:02:06.780> out<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.290> has<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
there's a website out there that has a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.199 
there's a website out there that has a
link<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.399> they'll<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.119> they'll

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
link to you on it they'll go and they'll

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.760 
link to you on it they'll go and they'll
find<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.629> website<00:02:09.899> they'll<00:02:10.289> click<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
find that website they'll click on that

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.020 
find that website they'll click on that
link<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.250> then<00:02:11.400> they'll<00:02:11.550> appear<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.000> your

times<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> first<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> spider<00:02:23.290> will<00:02:23.470> come

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
times the first time a spider will come

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.199 
times the first time a spider will come
across<00:02:23.709> your<00:02:24.040> website<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.550> will<00:02:24.610> only<00:02:24.760> index

across your website it will only index
your<00:02:25.390> home<00:02:25.540> page<00:02:25.780> we'll<00:02:26.349> talk<00:02:26.500> about<00:02:26.709> how<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
your home page we'll talk about how to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.920 
your home page we'll talk about how to
make<00:02:27.160> sure<00:02:27.310> spiders<00:02:27.700> index<00:02:28.060> deeper<00:02:28.390> pages<00:02:28.750> in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
make sure spiders index deeper pages in

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.080 
make sure spiders index deeper pages in
another<00:02:29.470> segment<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.069> then<00:02:30.550> once<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.819> finds

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
another segment and then once it finds

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.080 
another segment and then once it finds
those<00:02:31.300> pages<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.800> forwards<00:02:33.250> them<00:02:33.400> into<00:02:33.790> and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
those pages it forwards them into and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.460 
those pages it forwards them into and
that's<00:02:34.150> an<00:02:34.300> actual<00:02:34.420> picture<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.200> google

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
that's an actual picture of a google

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.860 
that's an actual picture of a google
data<00:02:35.590> center<00:02:35.950> it'll<00:02:36.580> put<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.150> data<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.569> finds

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
data center it'll put the data it finds

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.140 
data center it'll put the data it finds
into<00:02:38.739> those<00:02:38.860> hard<00:02:39.130> drives<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.880> that's<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
into those hard drives and so that's the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.640 
into those hard drives and so that's the
way<00:02:40.239> Google<00:02:40.540> finds<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.900> site<00:02:41.080> index<00:02:41.470> as<00:02:41.620> a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
way Google finds the site index as a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.890 
way Google finds the site index as a
site<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.130> now<00:02:42.580> you're<00:02:42.910> at<00:02:43.030> least<00:02:43.180> able<00:02:43.510> to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
site and now you're at least able to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.800 
site and now you're at least able to
rank<00:02:44.140> for<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:45.160> search<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.970> Google<00:02:46.330> or<00:02:46.450> Yahoo<00:02:46.599> or

rank for a search on Google or Yahoo or
