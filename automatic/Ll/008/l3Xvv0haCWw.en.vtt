I actually knew that this was on the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.620 
I actually knew that this was on the
website<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:26.820> I'm<00:00:27.210> using<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
website but I actually I'm using this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.250 
website but I actually I'm using this
for<00:00:27.840> my<00:00:27.930> new<00:00:28.050> airport<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.590> Auckland<00:00:29.240> so<00:00:30.260> even

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
for my new airport in Auckland so even

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.139 
for my new airport in Auckland so even
though<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.710> a380<00:00:32.160> usually<00:00:32.550> goes<00:00:32.730> there<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
though the a380 usually goes there I

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
though the a380 usually goes there I
just<00:00:33.360> kind<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.660> got<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.110> smaller<00:00:34.380> aircraft

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
just kind of got a smaller aircraft

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
just kind of got a smaller aircraft
because<00:00:35.719> you<00:00:36.719> know<00:00:36.870> usually<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.340> have

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
because you know usually they do have

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.420 
because you know usually they do have
some<00:00:38.790> smaller<00:00:39.000> aircraft<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:41.719> some<00:00:43.700> places

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
some smaller aircraft in some places

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
some smaller aircraft in some places
including<00:00:47.430> Auckland<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.899> Sydney<00:00:49.430> Australia

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
including Auckland like Sydney Australia

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
you know they have like an a380 and then

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.560 
you know they have like an a380 and then
a<00:00:54.530> 340<00:00:55.530> another<00:00:55.890> aircraft<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.820> let<00:00:57.329> me<00:00:57.420> just

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a 340 another aircraft so let me just

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
a 340 another aircraft so let me just
get<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> business<00:00:58.850> even<00:00:59.850> though<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.359> is

usually you know when you get the
aircraft<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> doesn't<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
aircraft it doesn't really have the

it's usually um blue and actually you

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's usually um blue and actually you

the Emirates official licensed product

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.679 
the Emirates official licensed product
which<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:38.939> weird<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.420> not

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
which is really a bit weird but not

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.350 
which is really a bit weird but not
really<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.670> tiny<00:01:41.939> majestic

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
really so this is a tiny majestic

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.249 
really so this is a tiny majestic
aircraft

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.539 

unboxing<00:01:46.259> now<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.470> actually<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> new

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
unboxing now and this is actually a new

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
unboxing now and this is actually a new
aircraft<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.869> I'm<00:01:51.990> actually<00:01:52.140> using<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.680> for

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
aircraft and I'm actually using this for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.990 
aircraft and I'm actually using this for
my<00:01:53.250> route<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:54.390> Los<00:01:54.630> Angeles<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:58.250> Dubai<00:01:59.250> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
my route from Los Angeles to Dubai so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120 
my route from Los Angeles to Dubai so
it's<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> far<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> think<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.979> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it's not really that far I think this is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.709 
it's not really that far I think this is
a<00:02:02.159> suitable<00:02:02.579> aircraft<00:02:02.909> instead<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> big

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
a suitable aircraft instead of the big

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.679 
a suitable aircraft instead of the big
a380<00:02:04.200> um<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.250> yeah<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> does<00:02:06.390> have

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
a380 um so yeah so this does have

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.410 
a380 um so yeah so this does have
rolling<00:02:07.020> wheels<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:09.000> give<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> better

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
rolling wheels just give you a better

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.609 
rolling wheels just give you a better
angle<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> aircraft

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
angle of the aircraft

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
angle of the aircraft
it<00:02:11.129> does<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.790> rolling<00:02:12.090> wheels

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it does have rolling wheels

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.050 
it does have rolling wheels
which<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:13.440> nice<00:02:13.680> because<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:15.030> know

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
which is pretty nice because you know

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.100 
which is pretty nice because you know
I'll<00:02:15.629> be<00:02:15.750> able<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.989> use<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:17.810> with<00:02:18.810> rolling

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
I'll be able to use this as with rolling

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.100 
I'll be able to use this as with rolling
wheels<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.849> actually<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> pretty<00:02:21.870> big

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
wheels and it is actually a pretty big

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.080 
wheels and it is actually a pretty big
aircraft<00:02:22.379> it's<00:02:22.860> bigger<00:02:23.099> than<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.400> think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
aircraft it's bigger than you think

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.210 
aircraft it's bigger than you think
it's<00:02:24.780> bigger<00:02:24.930> than<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.200> last<00:02:25.379> unboxing<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.099> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it's bigger than my last unboxing of the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.180 
it's bigger than my last unboxing of the
Delta<00:02:26.550> seven<00:02:26.819> four<00:02:26.970> seven<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:28.709> actually<00:02:29.010> just

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
Delta seven four seven it actually just

long

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.199 
long
regarding<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.849> no<00:02:39.140> not<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> width<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:41.209> just

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
regarding the no not the width just just

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.030 
regarding the no not the width just just
how<00:02:42.330> long<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.780> aircraft<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.290> basically<00:02:43.769> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
how long the aircraft is basically the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
how long the aircraft is basically the
width<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.549> longer<00:02:45.090> apparently<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.630> mean<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
width is longer apparently I mean I

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.069 
width is longer apparently I mean I
don't<00:02:46.349> really<00:02:46.590> know<00:02:46.860> why<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.489> because

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
don't really know why that is because

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.729 
don't really know why that is because
usually<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.230> 747<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.130> bigger<00:02:50.430> than<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.420> a3<00:02:51.810> 4500

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
usually a 747 is bigger than the a3 4500

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.830 
usually a 747 is bigger than the a3 4500
by<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.329> bit<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.720> um<00:02:55.549> yeah<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.690> the

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
by just a bit but um yeah so that is the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.710 
by just a bit but um yeah so that is the
aircraft<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.769> think<00:02:59.150> next<00:03:00.150> where<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.540> says

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.339 
aircraft and I think next where it says
