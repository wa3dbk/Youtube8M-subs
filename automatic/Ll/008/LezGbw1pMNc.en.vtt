00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
a ton blocking

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.640 
a ton blocking
if<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.680> take<00:00:11.670> your<00:00:11.780> Seaver<00:00:12.780> Monica<00:00:13.170> which<00:00:13.379> we

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
if you take your Seaver Monica which we

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.960 
if you take your Seaver Monica which we
are<00:00:13.740> using<00:00:13.950> this<00:00:15.170> stop<00:00:16.170> confusion<00:00:19.970> that's

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
are using this stop confusion that's

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.990 
are using this stop confusion that's
what<00:00:21.180> an<00:00:21.270> octo<00:00:21.570> sounds<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.520> so<00:00:23.520> here<00:00:23.880> I'm

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what an octo sounds like so here I'm

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.050 
what an octo sounds like so here I'm
playing<00:00:24.240> hole<00:00:24.509> 1<00:00:24.750> &amp;<00:00:25.050> 0<00:00:25.770> 4<00:00:26.100> i'm<00:00:26.369> blocking<00:00:26.640> whole

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
playing hole 1 &amp; 0 4 i'm blocking whole

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.690 
playing hole 1 &amp; 0 4 i'm blocking whole
two<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.869> three

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.500 

and<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:32.170> that<00:00:32.320> would<00:00:32.500> look<00:00:32.529> like<00:00:33.060> like<00:00:34.060> this

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.390 

if<00:00:38.960> I<00:00:39.109> move

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.270 

see<00:00:45.970> that

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.709 

so<00:00:54.789> what<00:00:54.910> that<00:00:54.940> would<00:00:55.180> sound<00:00:55.210> like<00:00:55.480> what<00:00:55.690> I

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
so what that would sound like what I

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.750 
so what that would sound like what I
just<00:00:55.930> did

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.179 

lalalalalala

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:16.180 

it<00:01:07.189> looks<00:01:07.549> like

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.300 

so

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
so

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.170 
so
I'm<00:01:18.850> doing<00:01:19.210> then

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.630 

I'm<00:01:22.630> always<00:01:22.870> blocking<00:01:23.200> two<00:01:23.500> holes<00:01:23.770> see<00:01:24.430> so

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
I'm always blocking two holes see so

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
I'm always blocking two holes see so
here

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
here

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:36.820 
here
sound<00:01:26.820> gets<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.420> into

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
one in four draw which gives me an

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:44.420 
one in four draw which gives me an
octave<00:02:35.920> but<00:02:36.920> when<00:02:37.909> i<00:02:37.939> play<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.109> whole<00:02:39.349> six

no this is called fluttery fluttering

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.229 
no this is called fluttery fluttering
momentum<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.239> I'm<00:03:13.239> playing<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.569> chord<00:03:15.239> good

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
momentum so I'm playing the chord good

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.199 
momentum so I'm playing the chord good

that would look like little monica some
playing<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.140> chord<00:03:30.720> good<00:03:31.720> i<00:03:31.810> got<00:03:31.840> like

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.090 

clean<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> cord<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.150> I'm<00:03:36.240> blocking<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.100> for

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
clean the cord and I'm blocking it for

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.260 
clean the cord and I'm blocking it for
blocking<00:03:39.060> cord<00:03:39.570> blocking<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.760> cord<00:03:42.060> is

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
blocking cord blocking now the cord is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.950 
blocking cord blocking now the cord is
four<00:03:42.570> times<00:03:42.960> one<00:03:43.200> two<00:03:43.620> three<00:03:44.310> four<00:03:44.930> not<00:03:45.930> five

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
four times one two three four not five

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.470 
four times one two three four not five
not<00:03:46.620> six<00:03:47.010> assists<00:03:47.460> those

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.170 

so<00:03:52.019> then<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.319> I<00:03:52.409> use<00:03:52.560> my<00:03:52.739> thumb<00:03:53.010> here<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.970> block

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
so then if I use my thumb here and block

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.210 
so then if I use my thumb here and block
off<00:03:54.239> two<00:03:54.569> holes

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.060 

you<00:03:58.670> see<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.120> it's<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.660> like<00:03:59.810> that<00:04:00.070> you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
you see that it's just like that you

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.440 
you see that it's just like that you
just<00:04:01.100> go<00:04:01.310> block<00:04:01.550> off<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.910> lowes<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.300> gotta

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
just go block off to lowes you gotta

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.430 
just go block off to lowes you gotta
move<00:04:02.600> up<00:04:02.750> one<00:04:02.990> space<00:04:04.240> up<00:04:05.240> to<00:04:05.390> those<00:04:05.570> looks<00:04:06.290> like

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
move up one space up to those looks like

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.880 
move up one space up to those looks like
that<00:04:06.650> all<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.010> time<00:04:07.250> then

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
that all the time then

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.500 
that all the time then
so<00:04:09.890> that's<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.470> short<00:04:12.940> introduction<00:04:13.940> to

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
so that's so you a short introduction to

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.590 
so that's so you a short introduction to
it<00:04:14.660> I've<00:04:15.020> done<00:04:15.260> another<00:04:15.560> chapter<00:04:16.370> on<00:04:16.820> octave

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
it I've done another chapter on octave
