00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.460
 video people welcome to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.919
 this extra episode here is about the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 the easter egg from minecraft in 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.799
 borderlands 2 and you have to go in 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.949
 the caustic kevins go 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.750
 you already notice I'm here alone, it 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.820
 is really just about this here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.550
 to uncover an easter egg and have a look 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 to show what that looks like 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.400
 I can also do alone because 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.230
 does not have to know about it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.070
 then we can be a bit below us 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.500
 store a bit 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.200
 it's really just here in the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.440
 cost in the last consequence we were 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 Already here that is from Jerry Hall is coming 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.649
 down here and then that 's it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.629
 lowers for the time being before episode 9 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.590
 I'm just talking about shit 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.820
 on everything and I do not do any here now 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
 mission or something I really just want 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 that one thing shows you that works and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 Therefore I let the monster just once 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.369
 lie left and you run 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 her right around when you come in directly 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 right just hold right once 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.390
 by running through this little customer 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.390
 here 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.130
 sounds like this little river 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.509
 I have to go here we have to go here 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:35.250
 in the upper corner so ingo here or 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.630
 There was no need to go there 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.299
 I'll try it on the map 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 mark that namely here 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.040
 as I said monster left live 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.280
 as long as they do not break me 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.280
 it does not matter 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.140
 then you have to go here once 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.359
 By this point , they come out 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.899
 then you have to go through this weird one 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.789
 by the monsters do not follow you either 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.459
 if the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.319
 amazon goes in or baseless 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.230
 little 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.489
 that's the wall street , so to speak 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.109
 I do not know if I can do this here 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 want to accelerate or not 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:29.209
 check it out then we had it here yes 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.480
 these gates opened last time with the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.480
 with this 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.840
 in schmiden because of me tell them when 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.310
 then you can go through this tunnel here 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.310
 through or else the outside is around 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.950
 I'll also be 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.590
 and then comes the shot of this 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.590
 to the outer end of the map 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.510
 then northwestern end of the card 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.629
 just here 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.900
 hold her right up 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.560
 down this block over here 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:16.239
 in here and we can already see that 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:25.450
 very much after minecraft with the 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:29.620
 melee attack that is only earth of 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.680
 Therefore, we are through and 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.680
 then comes back in here 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.400
 So it does not take you when I'm here 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.400
 The coal mining is just such an image 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.500
 what do we have here? 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:58.500
 a flu how cool is that yet 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 a fever 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.820
 another one 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.990
 hh 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.829
 I hate the minecraft is well with you 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.780
 how i hate pia and the gold 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.780
 Brocken give you a babysitter and 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.040
 the cool thing about it is so here 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.080
 things that raise the gold here 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.300
 fall mostly or just winter 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.450
 took ammunition and there are these 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:50.370
 gold blocks over here and we bring 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:53.550
 you can break money and what 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.690
 Also scenery finds here such a clippers 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.610
 layer you talk head customization and one 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.950
 skin adjustment for the command 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.440
 unfortunately I do not have that if one 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.360
 just once everything and you see here 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.260
 there is still something else here 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:17.240
 apart from that 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.240
 Here 's another wall over money 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:28.780
 If you break with grenades, you will break it 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.030
 do I can not believe somewhere 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.850
 must still be iridium can be found here 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:39.340
 namely I've seen anywhere so 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.220
 many blocks then as I give them 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.810

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.270

00:05:52.229 --> 00:06:02.289
 yes in any case with the skin adaptation 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:04.330
 can you if you have a command now 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:11.080
