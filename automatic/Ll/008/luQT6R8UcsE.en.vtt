you

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.000 

in<00:00:10.880> the<00:00:11.510> previous<00:00:11.750> chapter<00:00:11.900> we<00:00:12.410> experimented

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
in the previous chapter we experimented

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.090 
in the previous chapter we experimented
with<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:13.490> merge<00:00:13.970> path<00:00:14.540> shape<00:00:15.170> effect<00:00:15.559> to<00:00:16.010> go

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
with the merge path shape effect to go

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.340 
with the merge path shape effect to go
ahead<00:00:16.160> and<00:00:16.490> create<00:00:16.940> a<00:00:17.090> complex<00:00:17.660> compound

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
ahead and create a complex compound

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.620 
ahead and create a complex compound
shape<00:00:18.619> from<00:00:19.010> multiple<00:00:19.369> paths<00:00:19.610> we<00:00:20.300> use<00:00:20.450> those

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
shape from multiple paths we use those

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.780 
shape from multiple paths we use those
to<00:00:20.810> create<00:00:20.900> variations<00:00:21.560> on<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.340> skier<00:00:22.640> look

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
to create variations on the skier look

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.179 
to create variations on the skier look
however<00:00:23.689> there's<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.290> whole<00:00:24.529> group<00:00:24.890> of

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
however there's a whole group of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.040 
however there's a whole group of
different<00:00:25.550> shape<00:00:26.150> effects<00:00:26.510> that<00:00:26.780> are<00:00:26.840> worth

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
different shape effects that are worth

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.690 
different shape effects that are worth
exploring<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:28.039> that's<00:00:28.190> what<00:00:28.340> we'll<00:00:28.490> do<00:00:28.580> in

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
exploring and that's what we'll do in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.790 
exploring and that's what we'll do in
this<00:00:28.820> chapter<00:00:29.090> now<00:00:29.990> if<00:00:30.050> you<00:00:30.170> like<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:30.590> can<00:00:30.680> go

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
this chapter now if you like you can go

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.500 
this chapter now if you like you can go
back<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.160> your<00:00:31.250> original<00:00:31.310> rounded<00:00:32.000> rectangle

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
back to your original rounded rectangle

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.299 
back to your original rounded rectangle
turn<00:00:33.170> off<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.379> poly<00:00:33.559> star<00:00:33.860> so<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:34.160> have<00:00:34.250> a

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
turn off the poly star so you have a

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.189 
turn off the poly star so you have a
simple<00:00:34.489> shape<00:00:34.790> or<00:00:35.390> if<00:00:35.570> let's<00:00:35.780> get<00:00:35.930> some<00:00:36.080> more

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
simple shape or if let's get some more

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.410 
simple shape or if let's get some more
practice<00:00:36.320> in<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.640> like<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:37.850> cops<00:00:38.030> folder

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
complex of the parametric shapes so this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.490 
complex of the parametric shapes so this

things inside the shape group just for

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.430 
things inside the shape group just for
organization<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.900> I'm<00:01:50.990> gonna<00:01:51.110> make<00:01:51.230> sure<00:01:51.260> I

play around with is trim paths this is a
way<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.470> make<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:01.040> shape<00:02:01.310> layer<00:02:01.550> drawn<00:02:02.510> or

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
way you can make a shape layer drawn or

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.790 
way you can make a shape layer drawn or
draw<00:02:03.020> off<00:02:03.230> by<00:02:03.860> animating<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.460> start<00:02:05.560> or<00:02:06.560> end

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
draw off by animating a start or end

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.259 
draw off by animating a start or end
properties<00:02:09.159> if<00:02:10.159> we<00:02:10.310> turn<00:02:10.519> off<00:02:10.640> our<00:02:10.789> fill<00:02:11.000> for<00:02:11.239> a

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
properties if we turn off our fill for a

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.949 
properties if we turn off our fill for a
second<00:02:11.659> and<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:13.489> trimmed

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
second and it trimmed

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.349 
second and it trimmed
you'll<00:02:14.530> see<00:02:14.739> we'd<00:02:14.890> be<00:02:14.980> trimming<00:02:15.219> just<00:02:16.209> our

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
you'll see we'd be trimming just our

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:21.869 
you'll see we'd be trimming just our
stroke<00:02:18.180> I'll<00:02:19.180> turn<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.510> fill<00:02:19.719> back<00:02:20.439> on<00:02:20.879> if

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
stroke I'll turn that fill back on if

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.410 
stroke I'll turn that fill back on if
you<00:02:22.629> have<00:02:22.840> multiple<00:02:23.680> shapes<00:02:24.069> inside<00:02:25.060> your

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
you have multiple shapes inside your

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.780 
you have multiple shapes inside your
shape<00:02:25.689> group<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.709> go<00:02:26.890> ahead<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.280> draw<00:02:27.609> them

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
shape group you go ahead and draw them

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.809 
shape group you go ahead and draw them
all<00:02:27.939> on<00:02:28.120> simultaneously<00:02:28.930> or<00:02:29.319> one<00:02:30.310> after<00:02:30.549> the

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
all on simultaneously or one after the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.910 
all on simultaneously or one after the
other<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:31.659> is<00:02:31.840> very<00:02:32.049> similar<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.560> what<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
other this is very similar to what the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.080 
other this is very similar to what the
stroke<00:02:33.280> effect<00:02:33.670> could<00:02:33.879> do<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.359> mask<00:02:34.689> shapes

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
stroke effect could do with mask shapes

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.890 
stroke effect could do with mask shapes
one<00:02:37.090> other<00:02:37.239> thing<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.510> kind<00:02:37.719> of<00:02:37.750> interesting

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
one other thing is kind of interesting

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.449 
one other thing is kind of interesting
about<00:02:38.139> trim<00:02:38.439> paths<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.950> if<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.159> want<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.370> have

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
about trim paths is if you want to have

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.599 
about trim paths is if you want to have
a<00:02:39.489> partial<00:02:40.030> path<00:02:40.209> like<00:02:41.019> say<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.560> much<00:02:41.799> you

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
a partial path like say that much you

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.119 
a partial path like say that much you
can<00:02:42.760> use<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.090> offset<00:02:43.629> parameter<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.769> chase

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
can use the offset parameter to chase

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.449 
can use the offset parameter to chase
around<00:02:45.609> your<00:02:46.450> shape<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.189> getting<00:02:48.189> it<00:02:48.280> that's

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
around your shape and getting it that's

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.550 
around your shape and getting it that's
particularly<00:02:48.790> useful<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.019> happen<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.290> set

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
particularly useful if you happen to set

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.949 
particularly useful if you happen to set
your<00:02:50.829> fill<00:02:51.129> off<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:52.000> all<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.599> have<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.810> a

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
your fill off and all you have is a

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.899 
your fill off and all you have is a
stroke<00:02:53.319> because<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.189> you'll<00:02:54.370> chase<00:02:54.700> around

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
stroke because now you'll chase around

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.080 
stroke because now you'll chase around
the<00:02:55.450> outline<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.810> your<00:02:56.019> shape<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:57.730> turn<00:02:57.939> off

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the outline of your shape I can turn off

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.319 
the outline of your shape I can turn off
my<00:02:58.889> outlines<00:02:59.889> so<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.819> see<00:03:00.969> that<00:03:01.090> more<00:03:01.299> in

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
my outlines so you see that more in

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.490 
my outlines so you see that more in
isolation<00:03:03.209> I'll<00:03:04.209> turn<00:03:04.359> this<00:03:04.450> back<00:03:04.629> on<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.469> you

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
isolation I'll turn this back on so you

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.220 
isolation I'll turn this back on so you
can<00:03:05.709> see<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.189> original<00:03:06.280> shape<00:03:07.079> like<00:03:08.079> all

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
can see the original shape like all

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.140 
can see the original shape like all
other<00:03:08.469> elements<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.099> shape<00:03:09.310> group<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:10.000> do

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
other elements of a shape group you do

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.270 
other elements of a shape group you do
have<00:03:10.329> a<00:03:10.359> visibility<00:03:10.840> eyeball<00:03:11.439> right<00:03:11.769> next<00:03:12.099> to

have a visibility eyeball right next to
your<00:03:12.639> shape<00:03:12.909> effects<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:13.840> I'll<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.079> turn

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
your shape effects and I'll just turn

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.740 
your shape effects and I'll just turn
off<00:03:14.409> trim<00:03:14.769> paths<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.219> now<00:03:15.450> I'll<00:03:16.450> select<00:03:16.629> my

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
off trim paths for now I'll select my

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.259 
off trim paths for now I'll select my
shape<00:03:16.840> group<00:03:17.200> again<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:18.310> time<00:03:18.370> pick

it<00:04:07.799> have<00:04:07.980> a<00:04:08.040> great<00:04:08.250> name<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:09.359> create<00:04:09.659> some<00:04:09.780> very

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
it have a great name it create some very

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.710 
it have a great name it create some very
fun<00:04:10.430> distortions<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.489> your<00:04:11.730> shapes<00:04:12.030> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
fun distortions to your shapes it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.990 
fun distortions to your shapes it
basically<00:04:13.200> decides<00:04:13.620> if<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.250> segments

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
basically decides if the segments

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.650 
basically decides if the segments
between<00:04:15.979> vertices<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.459> shape<00:04:17.699> get<00:04:18.419> bowed

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
between vertices of the shape get bowed

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.740 
between vertices of the shape get bowed
outward<00:04:18.989> or<00:04:19.259> pulled<00:04:19.859> inward<00:04:20.280> our<00:04:21.269> word<00:04:21.539> is

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
outward or pulled inward our word is

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.230 
outward or pulled inward our word is
bloating<00:04:24.020> inward<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.440> puckering<00:04:25.889> and<00:04:26.280> you'll

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
bloating inward is puckering and you'll

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.640 
bloating inward is puckering and you'll
see<00:04:27.360> some<00:04:27.539> interesting<00:04:27.690> things<00:04:28.110> happen<00:04:28.530> at

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
see some interesting things happen at

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.529 
see some interesting things happen at
the<00:04:28.830> vertices<00:04:29.250> as<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.550> pucker<00:04:29.789> in<00:04:29.910> they

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
the vertices as you pucker in they

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.770 
the vertices as you pucker in they
overshoot<00:04:30.930> back<00:04:31.199> out<00:04:31.380> again

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.630 

so<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.440> way<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.650> quickly<00:04:35.280> creating

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
so this is a way of quickly creating

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.570 
so this is a way of quickly creating
some<00:04:36.000> very<00:04:36.330> complex<00:04:36.900> shapes<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.460> see

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
some very complex shapes so you can see

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.250 
some very complex shapes so you can see
how<00:04:38.640> things<00:04:38.820> fill<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.270> I'll<00:04:39.540> turn<00:04:40.020> on<00:04:40.050> that

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
how things fill in I'll turn on that

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
how things fill in I'll turn on that
salt<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.590> color<00:04:40.770> again<00:04:42.080> this<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.770> virtually

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
salt a color again this like virtually

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.830 
salt a color again this like virtually
any<00:04:44.490> other<00:04:44.580> parameter<00:04:44.880> shape<00:04:45.240> layers<00:04:45.480> can<00:04:45.780> be

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
any other parameter shape layers can be

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.780 
any other parameter shape layers can be
animated<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:47.340> can<00:04:47.460> create<00:04:47.610> some<00:04:47.760> really

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
animated so you can create some really

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.530 
animated so you can create some really
fun<00:04:48.720> graphical<00:04:49.680> animations<00:04:50.190> with<00:04:50.820> frankly<00:04:51.480> a

fun graphical animations with frankly a

quite a while to draw by hand but

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.780 
quite a while to draw by hand but
instead<00:04:57.060> it's<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.630> four-point<00:04:58.080> star<00:04:58.410> and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
instead it's just a four-point star and
