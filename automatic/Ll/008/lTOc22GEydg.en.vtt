00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello everyone with you dj black 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.260
 if you channel then we start i'm sure 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.330
 wanted to meet you in the game very 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.430
 wanted a page with you in the game but a lot 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.170
 my friends asked a question also i will 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.690
 removed from play to keep written 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.320
 camera and play like this is awkward 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.640
 agree and I apologize so i am sick 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.370
 and so what are we doing to play 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.620
 pes and on the computer we download 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.080
 repair program light light I'll post 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.909
 link under the description if i don't that 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.370
 note the program is called rome joy 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.100
 line there should be three folders b 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.820
 plug-ins guy 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.010
 and driver's so first thing we 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.650
 install the driver as soon as we have them 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.479
 install then you can connect usb 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.869
 if they are not installed then you 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:02.479
 press at the entrance to the computer f8 and 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:04.760
 click disable driver subscription 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.909
 if you have an operating system of course 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.810
 licensed like mine then you just 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.880
 download the program piispis dice 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.159
 connect your psp and install 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.899
 this program and then you have it 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.229
 install all drivers forcibly 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.030
 herself and so what we do next is like 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:31.750
 only we installed these drivers we 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:34.780
 connect psp and see the plug-ins C folder 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.399
 psp firmware psp should be flashed 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 see the plug-ins si folder if there is none 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.850
 I just create in big letters 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.340
 but if you have it small then 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.909
 leave little go in it here 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.549
 there must be nothing you do of 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.549
 folders repair wishes copy it all 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.350
 if you only have this one file then 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:00.649
 you just create text documents 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.020
 themselves in the game and baby dolls file 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.950
 Must be written with 07 plugin with 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.450
 light moji with x1 and game the same 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.240
 and in game 150 and everything is written the same 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.950
 but without the number 1 so when you do it 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.629
 do we turn off without pc and now i'm 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.159
 I'll show you what to do exactly on 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.790
 principle and so what are we doing with the very 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.769
 sands 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.459
 as I said rice and you have it 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.209

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:40.599

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:42.680
 recovery menu and click plug-ins and 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.250

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.159

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.159
 plug-in press the cross and turn on all 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.189
 here are these three plugins if you still have 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.590
 installed then you will have a lot of them 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:00.110
 these are the three main plugins you should and 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:06.590
 enable then you just press bad 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:11.060
 press the output and connect it back 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.250

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.620
 need to do next on the computer means 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.209
 we have no fashions mod that's it but we 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.310
 disable this yusbi mod or just if 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.180
 You have not connected is not automatically 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.200

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.920
 the computer doesn't see him 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.469
 more precisely psp well, you understand, and so we 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.530
 do next we go to the folder 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:42.500
 Mudgee light again and already see 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.829
 The xsd file is the Chinese version 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.219
 english run english version 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.930
 you have already activated the plugins and here you are 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:54.260

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.319
 so that the psp screen appears here and there 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.180
 just click the shredded lists and screen 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.840
 connects to the computer and disconnects 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.000
 on the sand by double clicking the mouse you 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.489
 go to the full screen in a letter 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.790
 versions of the mouse disappears you can do 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:15.409
 what do you want still say that when handling 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.989
 to save and when starting the game program 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.880

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.080
 I will launch it now 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:44.270
 and again I went into it very happy and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.030
