00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
weights stretch exhale both get a good

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.720 
weights stretch exhale both get a good
burn<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.300> they<00:02:13.570> definitely<00:02:13.780> feel<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.730> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
burn and they definitely feel it the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
next few days you're not used to it so

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.840 
next few days you're not used to it so
I'm<00:02:20.410> not<00:02:20.530> saying<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.610> most

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
I'm not saying this is the most

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.120 
I'm not saying this is the most
important<00:02:22.300> exercise<00:02:22.750> everybody<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.709> think

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
important exercise everybody I think

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.780 
important exercise everybody I think
it's<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.310> good<00:02:24.459> one<00:02:25.920> over<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> core<00:02:27.280> strength<00:02:27.640> and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
it's a good one over a core strength and

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.810 
it's a good one over a core strength and
stability<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> range<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.400> motion<00:02:32.700> maybe<00:02:33.700> a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
stability and range of motion maybe a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:47.750 
stability and range of motion maybe a
few<00:02:34.000> times<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.390> month<00:02:34.420> like<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> said
