possible<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.060> might<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.299> run<00:02:00.900> on

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080

so<00:02:26.040> next<00:02:26.400> thing<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> list<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.150> talk<00:02:27.330> about

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
so next thing on the list to talk about

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.320 
so next thing on the list to talk about
is<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.840> average<00:02:28.140> big<00:02:28.590> blue<00:02:28.920> box<00:02:29.370> thing<00:02:29.970> that

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
is this average big blue box thing that

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.990 
is this average big blue box thing that
can<00:02:30.630> travel<00:02:30.989> through<00:02:31.350> time<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.890> space<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
can travel through time and space and is

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.330 
can travel through time and space and is
powered<00:02:33.299> by<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.450> decaying<00:02:33.989> star<00:02:34.500> while<00:02:35.069> also

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
powered by a decaying star while also

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.330 
powered by a decaying star while also
being<00:02:35.700> bigger<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.540> inside<00:02:36.780> as<00:02:37.380> well<00:02:37.769> this

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
being bigger on the inside as well this

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.009 
being bigger on the inside as well this
bigger<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> inside<00:02:39.150> thing<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:39.840> made

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
bigger on the inside thing is all made

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.720 
bigger on the inside thing is all made
possible<00:02:40.049> because<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.860> TARDIS<00:02:41.220> actually

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
possible because the TARDIS actually

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.940 
possible because the TARDIS actually
exists<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.299> multiple<00:02:42.660> dimensions<00:02:43.560> for

exists in multiple dimensions for

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.220 
exists in multiple dimensions for

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.740 
example a square exists in two spacial
dimensions<00:02:46.769> just<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.850> video<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.420> cube

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750

exists in three spatial dimensions which

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.280 
exists in three spatial dimensions which

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
is also where we live with a crack

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.380 
is also where we live with a crack
smoking<00:02:52.560> mayor<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.340> tesseract<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.120> where

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
smoking mayor and the tesseract is where

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.120 
smoking mayor and the tesseract is where
four<00:02:54.720> dimensional<00:02:55.500> figures<00:02:55.890> would

four dimensional figures would

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580 
four dimensional figures would
theoretically<00:02:56.610> exist<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.019> TARDIS<00:02:58.440> would

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
theoretically exist and the TARDIS would

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.440 
theoretically exist and the TARDIS would
exist<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.069> all<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.430> these<00:02:59.609> spatial<00:03:00.000> dimensions

exist in all of these spatial dimensions

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.690 
exist in all of these spatial dimensions
and<00:03:00.570> possibly<00:03:01.200> more<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.829> picture<00:03:02.250> stepping

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
and possibly more so picture stepping

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.250 
and possibly more so picture stepping
through<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.940> three-dimensional<00:03:03.840> cube<00:03:04.109> and

through a three-dimensional cube and

through a three-dimensional cube and
ending<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.829> four<00:03:05.070> dimensional

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
tesseract that's kind of what happens

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.949 
tesseract that's kind of what happens
when<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.250> step<00:03:08.519> into<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> TARDIS<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.750> could

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
when you step into the TARDIS this could

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.599 
when you step into the TARDIS this could
also<00:03:10.109> mean<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.859> TARDIS<00:03:11.160> might<00:03:11.400> actually

also mean that the TARDIS might actually

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.479 
also mean that the TARDIS might actually

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.340 
second that's 100 billion times more
energy<00:03:42.460> than<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.790> Sun<00:03:42.820> releases<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.930> year

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
energy than the Sun releases in a year

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.380 
energy than the Sun releases in a year
in<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.950> television<00:03:45.340> show<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.880> energy<00:03:46.330> is

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
in the television show this energy is

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.390 
in the television show this energy is
used<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.810> open<00:03:47.170> up<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.410> wormhole<00:03:47.620> which<00:03:48.070> allows

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
used to open up a wormhole which allows

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.820 
used to open up a wormhole which allows
traveling<00:03:49.120> through<00:03:49.360> time<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.870> space<00:03:50.080> but

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
traveling through time and space but

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.620 
traveling through time and space but
time<00:03:51.040> traveling<00:03:51.550> with<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.880> TARDIS<00:03:52.270> could<00:03:52.450> be

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
time traveling with the TARDIS could be

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.170 
time traveling with the TARDIS could be
done<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:53.080> different<00:03:53.110> ways<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:54.490> what<00:03:54.790> are<00:03:55.000> those

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
done in different ways so what are those

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.330 
done in different ways so what are those
other<00:03:55.390> ways<00:03:55.660> well<00:03:56.380> that's<00:03:56.680> gonna<00:03:56.860> require<00:03:57.070> a

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
other ways well that's gonna require a

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.210 
other ways well that's gonna require a
whole<00:03:57.760> other<00:03:58.060> episode<00:03:58.300> in<00:03:58.810> itself<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.650> summary

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
whole other episode in itself in summary

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.490 
whole other episode in itself in summary
it's<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.610> time<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.180> me<00:04:01.450> thing<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:02.050> if<00:04:02.380> you
