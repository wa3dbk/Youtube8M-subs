called the hip area with fat transfer to
the<00:02:09.540> hip<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.930> when<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.410> combine<00:02:10.619> those<00:02:10.920> three

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
the hip and when you combine those three

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.160 
the hip and when you combine those three
principles<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.690> very<00:02:12.930> very

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
principles you can get very very

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.410 
principles you can get very very
excellent<00:02:13.800> results<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:14.970> procedure

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
excellent results one procedure

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.150 
excellent results one procedure
typically<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.020> not<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.410> be<00:02:16.530> able<00:02:16.890> to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
typically is not going to be able to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
typically is not going to be able to
provide<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:18.210> resolve<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.690> most<00:02:18.870> patient

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
provide that resolve the most patient

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.430 
provide that resolve the most patient
one<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.680> by<00:02:19.770> combining<00:02:20.010> different

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
one and by combining different

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.770 
one and by combining different
techniques<00:02:22.440> then<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:24.330> excellent

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
techniques then you can get excellent

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.390 
techniques then you can get excellent
results<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.100> reason

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
results and this is one of the reason

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.720 
results and this is one of the reason
why<00:02:26.430> patients<00:02:27.060> choose<00:02:27.900> me<00:02:28.370> from<00:02:29.370> other

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
why patients choose me from other

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.840 
why patients choose me from other
surgeons<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:31.170> very<00:02:31.380> hard<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.770> just<00:02:32.310> doing

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
surgeons it's very hard for just doing

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.510 
surgeons it's very hard for just doing
