00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Now let's see the next figure. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.280
 which is as old as the circle and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.139
 square and this is a triangle and usually this 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 isosceles triangle given case 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.550
 we draw a directional triangle 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:22.289
 point up is a masculine character in all 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.500
 countries of the world is an equilateral triangle 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 upward triangle 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 denotes male power movement growth 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.460
 development that is all that we both 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.230
 usually associate with men some 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480
 can argue with me say you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.180
 know here in soviet time here if you 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.110
 remember men's toilet cabins 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 the sign was designated completely differently 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.430
 it was designated in this way and many 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.629
 him in associations and as if painted 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 what is this shoulders 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.359
 man's and it's like a woman's dress 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 Well, what is the tone of the Soviet Union 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.890
 why it happened so much we don’t 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.229
 know and where it comes from but if you for example 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.299
 in the same milan we will see as indicated 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.720
 toilet cubicles 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.310
 then it will be a male booth and it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 female I myself saw it my captain 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.250
 school but on the other hand let's 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 look at the result of the post-Soviet 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.850
 spaces what happens there with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.970
 men and what happens women 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.460
 if a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.920
 from the post-Soviet space goes to know 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.979
 that this is a female sign there 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.890
 a galloping woman will stop but and or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.530
 this task and what they say about men 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.130
 yeah i don't like that expression but 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.470
 I heard him yes a woman is not a man can 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.470
 there is some sense in this 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 well, let's do it again and now 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.619
 let's pay attention to this man's how 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.619
 square to 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 It means the most important thing that we can 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.170
 see in this in the male triangles 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.929
 that he stably stands on the ground and that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 moving forward a man should be stable 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.959
 stand on the ground and then I his height will 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.319
 natural and other options he has 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.599
 will not how to grow and if we want here 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.720
 this male triangle support we 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.940
 fill it with red and red 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.680
 color like this one here is a triangle 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.080
 pointed up he is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.780
 male sign and red triangle a 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.349
 stranger it will be an absolute male 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.930
 symbol 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.010
 but with other words even rumored possible 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.110
 look from the other side he 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 reminds us also a fire yes that is 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.599
 fire movement he might be somewhere 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.209
 frightening because here is this sharp form 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:56.260
 I run into it very much for you 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.090
 favorably but reasonably 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.049
 balanced it will be very very 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.380
 good sign so let's summarize 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.109
 triangle isosceles triangle 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.870
 pointed up this is masculine 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.310
 the symbol it supports is red which 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.380
 also essentially male color 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.690
 he means all that means 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.720
 movement and fire that is fire 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.630
 development can be aggression of course 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.380
 power meaning it is very very strong 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.359
 a symbol for those who are strong if we 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.220
 look at another triangle which 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.800
 we too already 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.450
 a little bit met him on female 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.680
 the triangle then we will see perfectly 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.400
 another story, he also seems to be a form of the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.880
 same but woman she is always 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:51.240
 balancing at one point and principle 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.130
 if to understand a woman you need to understand 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.500
 what to balance forever on one 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.510
 the point you seem to find a balance 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.380
 you make a move and you need to again 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.510
 seek balance 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.790
 from here you can understand these frequent shifts 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.680
 mood feeling that you are somewhere 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.410
 you are falling for something that you don’t 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.400
 enough but it's not very easy 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.209
 balance at one point and if we 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.640
 want to understand 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.130
 what color is it exactly associated with 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.940
 triangle pointing down then 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.270
 it will be green 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.860
 life color all new color 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.440
 well-being and 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.870
 and what is green in green 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.750
 it consists of yellow stability 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.630
 looking for all women and blue information then 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.370
 which is also important for all women any 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.500
 woman ask what she needs to say 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.760
 i need stability why i need 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.500
 stability because it stands on 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.250
 one point she can't without 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.770
 stability 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.250
 the second thing a woman needs is a woman 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.870
 know this information is blue if 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.200
 the woman does not know I will not 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.310
 Stability and yellow with blue gives here 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.430
 this one is a green tint and it means so 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.060
 what is the green triangle point 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.240
 down is the source yes it looks like the source 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.190
 it is a cup of well-being if it is stable 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.960
 then everything grows and happens like 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:19.200
 should be and this is a symbol of life this 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.940
 the symbol of all life on earth and now we 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.280
 can connect these two signs and 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.360
 see what happens and we 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.800
 if we connect these two characters we get 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.800
 the so -called star of david 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:40.710
 yes yes know the star ideal perfect 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 man's life can be stable then 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.660
 when he keeps the stability of a woman 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.790
 if vice versa a woman can be 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.740
 stable when when it is stable 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.870
 holding onto a man these two signs 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.290
 very strongly support only a friend 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.990
 until if a woman has something to hold on to 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.240
 shoulders a man figuratively speaking which 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.600
 stably on the ground it will be 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.860
 give it stability too if 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.700
 we look at this sign in the east we are all 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.540
 familiar with him 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:17.820
 it will be a well-known sign yin yang 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:20.910
 and if we turned the color as we do 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.890
 they he was designated initially they 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.560
 then when came up as a copier and 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.020
 black white paper yes there and green juice 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.140
 we see that the yin yang sign also had in 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.180
 imagine two colors green and red and 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:38.010
 Essentially, this will be the Eastern version 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.490
 stable and happy happy 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.890
 life and this is the western version which 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.500
 has the same full removed and that 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.990
 same information again and in many 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:53.400
 Many people probably remember this 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:56.810
 ornament for example we have a flat view too 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.810
 denoting happiness
