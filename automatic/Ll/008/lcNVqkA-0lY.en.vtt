00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
just not put ourselves in a box

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.090 
just not put ourselves in a box
creatively<00:00:49.400> as<00:00:49.520> far<00:00:49.760> as<00:00:50.470> stylistically<00:00:51.470> we

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
creatively as far as stylistically we

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.830 
creatively as far as stylistically we
really<00:00:52.430> push<00:00:52.640> we<00:00:52.820> actually<00:00:53.180> kind<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.450> at<00:00:53.570> first

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
really push we actually kind of at first

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.270 
really push we actually kind of at first
we<00:00:54.020> were<00:00:54.110> trying<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.410> challenge<00:00:54.650> ourselves<00:00:54.920> to

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
we were trying to challenge ourselves to

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.200 
we were trying to challenge ourselves to
do<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.850> different<00:00:56.329> style<00:00:56.660> on<00:00:56.870> every<00:00:57.140> song<00:00:57.410> and

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
do a different style on every song and

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.720 
do a different style on every song and
it<00:00:59.210> can't<00:00:59.720> be<00:00:59.960> perceived<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.040> be<00:01:01.130> all<00:01:01.370> over<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
it can't be perceived to be all over the

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.149 
it can't be perceived to be all over the
place<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.210> somehow<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.960> me<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.410> album<00:01:03.770> flows

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
place but somehow to me the album flows

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.800 
place but somehow to me the album flows
together<00:01:04.430> because<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.089> production<00:01:05.570> quality

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
together because of production quality

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.090 
together because of production quality
and<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.110> vibe<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:06.649> had<00:01:06.799> was<00:01:06.920> so

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
and the vibe that we had was so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.230 
and the vibe that we had was so
consistent<00:01:07.759> throughout<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.030> project

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
consistent throughout the project

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.810 
consistent throughout the project
because<00:01:09.079> basically<00:01:09.320> we<00:01:09.680> did<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.640> to

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
because basically we did it and it to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.840 
because basically we did it and it to
expand<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:12.409> knocked<00:01:12.920> out<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.280> songs<00:01:13.550> like

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
expand and we knocked out the songs like

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.700 
expand and we knocked out the songs like
we<00:01:14.030> literally<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.659> think<00:01:14.990> bobby<00:01:15.170> was<00:01:15.260> over<00:01:15.590> here

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.759 
into another song and then by the third
song<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.540> think<00:03:43.930> something<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.290> started

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
song I think something just started

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.070 
song I think something just started
clicking<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.730> was<00:03:45.880> like<00:03:46.000> okay<00:03:46.420> we're<00:03:46.780> on<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.600 
clicking and I was like okay we're on to
something<00:03:47.110> like<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.739> first<00:03:48.010> two<00:03:48.190> songs<00:03:48.370> were

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610
