00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello everyone, shake with you today we 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.790
 we will play in the world of tanks 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.509
 some asked i will do yes many 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 wrote why I drive on the circuit 11 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.789
 land mines explain most of the year 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 hit the tenth level and when i miss 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.609
 waffle is not very nice to discharge these all 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.090
 land mines in her tower that's why I drive 11 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.810
 of mines they golda golda here here so 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.390
 breaking through how much 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.989
 324 this is too much much more 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.840
 then he and so the video punches everything so 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 I do not need more penetration, but today we 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.149
 from the bottom of a career earlier generally british 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 such 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.640
 level eight simply language 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.610
 break with all the more with my 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.430
 by pronunciation it gets worse 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.010
 let's get on a career not exactly 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.539
 same as this horse is just different 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 towers and guns 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:09.150
 well, and and engine power and weight and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.040
 HP and booking the tower when u 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.830
 career tower booking is better than 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.170
 at the contour 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.110
 which is so right on the water 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.970
 rate of fire is higher 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:30.890
 seizure all the same 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.890
 fight so what we got on the map ESC 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 in the middle 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.400
 That's because they say we got to 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.280
 waffles and 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.820
 icon too often here as we perform well 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.990
 and landmine resolve well of course hit 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.030
 very bad 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.110
 Karina enemies us drink and enough 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.630
 to punch everyone but it's not very 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.810
 good but those I do not, I had a 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.790
 I even think that probably even a sulin 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.650
 Zelenka because I am exactly here 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.960
 there is nothing to do in the land 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:16.370
 support that will kill here 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:18.580
 everybody here is to stand what he is trying 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.580
 to make 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.290
 we will ram up why in the form 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.290
 he drove me to his problems 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.670
 so on iso 7 I will not go there hevik worth 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.700
 roll out to him, too, will not 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.409
 I'm getting trapped 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.409
 not good why 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.280
 a 0 tenth level 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.280
 tank and we all went for some reason on 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:04.830
 railway honorary can 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:06.860
 cram it don't like it here i'm 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:13.280
 saying break through me so much that 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.280
 hide corpse did not hide to the end 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.819
 now we are not so lucky we hide 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:34.069
 mask mask together healthy let's it 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.250
 just a little beat that he that he 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.250
 does 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.599
 should have been a little earlier 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.620
 well and thanks to that because I am 8 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:54.599
 vs 9 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:58.270
 not a game, but I told him the fault of kindness 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.220
 to take the good of you to the hard worker 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.530

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:13.600
 Iâ€™ll not read about it 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.299
 Yes, it was necessary to put it on so: 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.450
 I guess maybe the field is better butt he sometimes 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.470
 looks at me so you have to leave 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.470
 get away from here 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.500
 need to leave because of the following 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.710
 times created by me 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:36.270
 And I personally height here it happens such 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:41.440

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:05.030

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:08.960

 the very end with 10 levels without gold 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:29.919

 experience 30 28 thousand credits is pretty 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.849
 not bad, I'm in first place by experience 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:44.800
 at the eighth level with dozens so 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:47.650
 it's about something that says for good 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.520
 1200 blocked for such a tank 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.039

00:06:51.039 --> 00:07:00.430
