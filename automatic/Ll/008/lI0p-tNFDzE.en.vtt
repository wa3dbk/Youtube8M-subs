what was very unique is that the whole

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.459 
what was very unique is that the whole
tree<00:00:43.589> is<00:00:43.949> covered<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.999> product<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
tree is covered in this product so that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.849 
tree is covered in this product so that
the<00:00:46.800> bugs<00:00:47.039> can't<00:00:47.609> get<00:00:47.999> to<00:00:48.749> the<00:00:49.199> fruit<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.710> lay

the egg the egg hatches and turns into

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
the egg the egg hatches and turns into
worm<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.269> if<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.569> prevents<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.499> from

a stapler under it we visited in a

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.160 
a stapler under it we visited in a
couple<00:04:11.880> days<00:04:12.030> ago<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.600> said<00:04:12.810> well<00:04:12.989> how<00:04:13.109> do

strong I just pull it and the street the
staples<00:04:17.160> come<00:04:17.370> through<00:04:17.900> yeah<00:04:19.639> it's<00:04:20.639> really

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
staples come through yeah it's really

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.780 
staples come through yeah it's really
really<00:04:21.959> strong

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
really strong

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.160 
really strong
the<00:04:24.790> pesticides<00:04:25.450> people<00:04:25.810> aren't<00:04:25.990> going<00:04:26.080> to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
the pesticides people aren't going to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
the pesticides people aren't going to
like<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.500> at<00:04:26.710> all<00:04:26.830> but<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.950> works<00:04:29.950> like

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
like this at all but it just works like

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.280 
like this at all but it just works like
a<00:04:30.220> charm<00:04:30.550> they're<00:04:31.060> not<00:04:31.210> worried<00:04:31.480> about<00:04:31.570> it<00:04:31.750> in

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
a charm they're not worried about it in

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.210 
a charm they're not worried about it in
fact<00:04:32.650> it's<00:04:32.860> being<00:04:33.070> encouraged<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:34.050> good

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
fact it's being encouraged it's a good

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.530 
fact it's being encouraged it's a good
one<00:04:36.220> of<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.400> big<00:04:36.580> things<00:04:36.610> is<00:04:37.030> people<00:04:37.390> need

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
one of the big things is people need

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.260 
one of the big things is people need
choices<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:39.100> okay<00:04:39.400> there's<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.670> traditional

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
choices and okay there's a traditional

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.810 
choices and okay there's a traditional
way<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.420> do<00:04:40.630> things<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:42.430> is<00:04:42.670> an

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
way to do things and this is an

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.730 
way to do things and this is an
alternate<00:04:43.240> way<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:43.660> what<00:04:43.870> we're<00:04:44.050> finding<00:04:44.320> is

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
alternate way and what we're finding is

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.310 
alternate way and what we're finding is
is<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.340> actually<00:04:45.640> working<00:04:45.850> better

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
is this is actually working better

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.400 
is this is actually working better
because<00:04:47.320> as<00:04:47.470> protecting<00:04:48.070> from<00:04:48.280> more

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
because as protecting from more

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.210 
because as protecting from more
situations<00:04:50.410> than<00:04:50.830> just<00:04:51.220> let's<00:04:51.580> say<00:04:51.880> for<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:52.870> bug

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
situations than just let's say for a bug

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.400 
situations than just let's say for a bug
it's<00:04:54.220> also<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:55.120> fungal<00:04:55.480> side<00:04:55.660> it's<00:04:56.470> also<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
it's also the fungal side it's also the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.040 
it's also the fungal side it's also the
the<00:04:59.410> rain<00:04:59.710> water<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.460> also<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:01.270> but<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
the rain water it's also the but the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.760 
the rain water it's also the but the
birds<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:03.040> wasps<00:05:03.640> so<00:05:04.120> it's<00:05:04.270> all-encompassing

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
birds the wasps so it's all-encompassing

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.320 
birds the wasps so it's all-encompassing
it's<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.890> way<00:05:06.070> beyond<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.850> pesticide

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
it's a way beyond just the pesticide

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.320 
it's a way beyond just the pesticide
itself<00:05:07.690> and<00:05:08.580> it's<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.640> great<00:05:09.910> really<00:05:10.300> great

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
itself and it's a great really great

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.230 
itself and it's a great really great
choice<00:05:11.010> partners<00:05:12.010> are<00:05:12.160> going<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.580> get<00:05:12.760> end<00:05:13.060> up

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
choice partners are going to get end up

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.690 
choice partners are going to get end up
with<00:05:13.480> way<00:05:14.050> more<00:05:14.080> yield<00:05:14.680> yes<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.490> way<00:05:15.670> less

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
with way more yield yes and way less

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.790 
with way more yield yes and way less
call<00:05:16.210> yeah<00:05:16.450> there's<00:05:16.720> no<00:05:16.960> some<00:05:17.260> people<00:05:17.290> lose<00:05:17.770> a

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
call yeah there's no some people lose a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.580 
call yeah there's no some people lose a
lot<00:05:18.100> of<00:05:18.280> their<00:05:18.550> cherries<00:05:19.090> just<00:05:19.360> two<00:05:19.480> birds<00:05:19.720> the

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
lot of their cherries just two birds the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.810 
lot of their cherries just two birds the
birds<00:05:20.830> can't<00:05:21.100> get<00:05:21.280> through<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.610> yet<00:05:21.700> it

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
birds can't get through and yet it

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.190 
birds can't get through and yet it
doesn't<00:05:21.970> kill<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.360> birds<00:05:22.570> yeah<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.110> know

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200

nothing gets killed they just don't
reproduce<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.390> here's<00:05:25.840> one<00:05:26.080> here's<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.410> guy<00:05:26.590> I

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
reproduce it here's one here's a guy I

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.120 
reproduce it here's one here's a guy I
just<00:05:27.160> took<00:05:27.310> this<00:05:27.490> picture<00:05:27.760> two<00:05:28.030> days<00:05:28.210> ago<00:05:28.390> and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
just took this picture two days ago and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.670 
just took this picture two days ago and
this<00:05:30.130> is<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:31.030> hundred<00:05:31.210> percent<00:05:31.420> crop<00:05:32.380> loss

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
this is one hundred percent crop loss

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.180 
this is one hundred percent crop loss
from<00:05:33.160> wasps<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:34.560> even<00:05:35.560> if<00:05:35.740> you<00:05:35.890> look<00:05:36.070> at<00:05:36.160> the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
from wasps and even if you look at the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.930 
from wasps and even if you look at the
vineyard<00:05:36.910> here<00:05:37.450> right<00:05:37.810> beside<00:05:37.960> us<00:05:38.760> you<00:05:39.760> will

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
vineyard here right beside us you will

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.390 
vineyard here right beside us you will
find<00:05:40.210> a<00:05:40.540> lot<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.810> their<00:05:41.050> grape<00:05:41.290> clusters<00:05:41.830> have

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
find a lot of their grape clusters have

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.420 
find a lot of their grape clusters have
oh<00:05:43.020> ten<00:05:44.020> fifteen<00:05:44.470> percent<00:05:44.890> of<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.250> grape

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
oh ten fifteen percent of the grape

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.600 
oh ten fifteen percent of the grape
cluster<00:05:45.910> is<00:05:46.380> raisin<00:05:47.380> dup<00:05:47.560> because<00:05:48.220> of<00:05:48.340> wasp

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
cluster is raisin dup because of wasp

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.990 
cluster is raisin dup because of wasp
damage<00:05:50.040> yeah

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
damage yeah

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.180 
damage yeah
and<00:05:52.120> so<00:05:52.870> by<00:05:53.200> putting<00:05:53.890> this<00:05:54.160> cover<00:05:54.520> over<00:05:54.850> top

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
and so by putting this cover over top

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.430 
and so by putting this cover over top
here's<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.280> picture<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:58.870> can<00:05:59.020> see<00:05:59.200> how

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
here's a picture you can see how

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.650 
here's a picture you can see how
translucent<00:06:00.160> it<00:06:00.220> is<00:06:00.340> they<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.850> vineyards

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
translucent it is they the vineyards

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.270 
translucent it is they the vineyards
actually<00:06:01.960> do<00:06:02.050> very<00:06:02.290> well<00:06:02.350> the<00:06:02.680> sugar<00:06:02.890> readings

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
actually do very well the sugar readings

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.760 
actually do very well the sugar readings
are<00:06:03.400> very<00:06:03.580> very<00:06:03.790> high<00:06:04.290> because<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:05.440> sunlight

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
are very very high because the sunlight

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.770 
are very very high because the sunlight
is<00:06:05.920> getting<00:06:06.310> through<00:06:06.610> but<00:06:07.060> there's<00:06:07.210> no<00:06:07.330> wasps

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
is getting through but there's no wasps

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.720 
is getting through but there's no wasps
no<00:06:08.380> damage<00:06:08.770> one<00:06:09.010> hundred<00:06:09.220> percent<00:06:09.250> yield

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
no damage one hundred percent yield
