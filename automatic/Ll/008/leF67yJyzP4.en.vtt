00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
noticed is that a series called Vikings

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.550 
noticed is that a series called Vikings
is<00:02:52.990> pretty<00:02:53.620> pretty<00:02:53.950> good<00:02:55.050> representation<00:02:56.050> and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
is pretty pretty good representation and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.320 
is pretty pretty good representation and
natural<00:02:56.830> fact<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.160> shield<00:02:57.700> walls<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.180> how

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
natural fact of shield walls and how

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.360 
natural fact of shield walls and how
shield<00:02:58.630> walls<00:02:58.900> are<00:02:59.110> used<00:02:59.500> so<00:02:59.980> I'm<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.310> to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
shield walls are used so I'm going to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.000 
shield walls are used so I'm going to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
to be used they do run which I don't

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.680

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
a shield wall walking is fine you don't

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.150 
a shield wall walking is fine you don't
need<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.730> sprint<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.209> speed<00:03:25.570> but<00:03:26.080> they<00:03:26.769> do<00:03:26.830> at

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
need to sprint I speed but they do at

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.400 
need to sprint I speed but they do at

engaged really with each other which is

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.610 
engaged really with each other which is
exactly<00:03:36.850> what<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.239> sources<00:03:37.600> describe<00:03:38.230> shield

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
exactly what the sources describe shield

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.190 
exactly what the sources describe shield
walls<00:03:38.920> doing<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.760> yes<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.570> get<00:03:40.750> some<00:03:41.019> if

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
walls doing and yes you get some if

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.780 
walls doing and yes you get some if
you've<00:03:41.500> got<00:03:41.620> two<00:03:41.830> walls<00:03:42.070> come<00:03:42.340> come<00:03:42.640> together

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
you've got two walls come come together

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.940 
you've got two walls come come together
sometimes<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.600> get<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.840> longer<00:03:44.200> wall<00:03:44.440> will<00:03:44.680> lap

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
sometimes you get a longer wall will lap

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.040 
sometimes you get a longer wall will lap
around<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.580> edges<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.150> shorter<00:03:46.600> wall<00:03:46.810> and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
around the edges of a shorter wall and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.540 
around the edges of a shorter wall and
this<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.260> how<00:03:47.500> shield<00:03:47.769> walls<00:03:48.010> work

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
this is how shield walls work

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.970 
this is how shield walls work
they<00:03:48.880> didn't<00:03:49.239> upon<00:03:49.630> engaging<00:03:50.080> then<00:03:50.650> break

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
they didn't upon engaging then break

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.130 
they didn't upon engaging then break
