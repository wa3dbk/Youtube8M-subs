00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.130
 I love this brand and the patio at home 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.380
 and in my city 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.520
 when the company says that you have to 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.170
 to move alone you only have a cow cartoonist 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.000
 and you have to accept it if you have to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.000
 moving to another city ​​is difficult 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.040
 I told Gonzalez that everything will return to the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 normality when they are in their new house 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 although it is a great change our 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 garages and messy from the day that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.190
 we moved it when you remember 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.190
 you promised to clean the garage 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 the girl is always looking for something 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.540
 what is it about this time they have land in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.540
 the nails 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.490
 no no 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.909
 I did not know you cared so much for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.400
 please do not tell the other children we 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.229
 we went to give away on my soccer ball 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.229
 if you do not say it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.909
 with my doll because he always reminds me 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.200
 very well what you want to tell me that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.890
 my family is so important 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.890

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.880
 now that we give them back this ensures 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.860

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.740
