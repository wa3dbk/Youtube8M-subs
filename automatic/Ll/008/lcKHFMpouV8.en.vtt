00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.560
 we have the shot let's say the line that 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.810
 echo channel + 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.579
 we see in that sinesio action are not 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.669
 out of play but what he said he could 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:13.669
 in two dimensions every 32 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.199
 those people 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:48.940
 they are here 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.900
 and also the feeling that I have it 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.309
 did not let me suspend geometry said 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.230
 this I tell you the salt 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.729
 it's as if it were the tracks of a train 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.360
 but instead of being parallel 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.590
 stays and continue towards may 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 and then say what you feel that you do not 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.140
 like he does not like that does not fit me 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.140
 this is not OK 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.160
 because not because he did not go 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.200
 out of play of me if it's so big 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.200
 that is not credible is not credible as 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.830
 20 centimeters 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.970
 I think the picture speaks often moves 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.790
 move that has produced that this is a 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.649
 let's say a take a frame are going to see 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.759
 how is the evolution of the action and we 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.110
 convinces more 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.450
 although they are experts who do it in 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.000
 care of the colorado I'm willing 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.830
 to rectify and there we have the moment 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.260
 there is the value that the mail wanted yes yes 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.659
 clear moves the camera is those two 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.299
 dimensions that are diddy months are 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:14.620
 about we are there would be if the 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:14.620
 perspective would be this one that is 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:23.510
 correct and normal here has the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.730
 different perspective but you put yourself in the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.890
 law angle of the action 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.709
 here you do not know here it seems that this straight 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.420
 the good perspective seems to be 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.690
 perfectly parallel here the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.299
 perspective then is the line worked 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.540
 perfect is that effectively the 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:46.700
 perspective of what they say that if you 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.799
 does the parallel line would still be 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:56.660
 less out of the game with which it is 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:03:01.870
 clear but if it were parallel it would be 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.870
 even more than he is taking the ball 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 for let's say what the experts that 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.940
 they are saying something we have on twitter 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.830
 in industrial design and I see the line very 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.800
 well but perfect says stop 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.650
 missing the truth and this is so there is no 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.110
 out of the game I tell you from here 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.600
 he perceives cinnamon, that is, you can not 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.350
 look worse than hermel and roncero is 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.850
 night or honors you honor follow in the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.390
 dish and hold until the end of the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.940
 Program 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.280
 after tonight because 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.950
 start selling robbery when you have 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.470
 called two penalties in favor when there 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.320
 two not called to the boat when it comes out 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.740
 dani benÃ­tez and recognize everything and leave you 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.530
 portrayed the two of you worthy to stay there 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.690
 seated and have the courage to endure 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.660
 until the end of the program 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.970
 I do not remember programmer in the brains 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.680
 worse than tonight or yes yes all that is 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.310
 if you can make gestures and what 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.280
 but you want to take perceived nerves 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.780
 perceive the funk and care that of 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.780
 there are five but 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.040
 Yes Yes Yes Yes
