00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.460

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.460
 not 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.970
 said gang beauty fight back 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.100
 how to provoke and today I'll go 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.890
 talk about a subject that came out that I 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.110
 I do not know if it's fake or if it's true 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.880
 sure but I want to discuss together with 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.580
 You and I'll leave it to you too. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.280
 also personally let the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.440
 video link about some information 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.300
 leaks on gta 6 to 1 in the game can 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.640
 give some details about the game 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.130
 before you start talking to some 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.800
 details on the subject I will read that 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.230
 the news for you to see, okay ok 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.930
 according to rumors the production of the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.559
 Next franchise game has started soon 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.460
 after the exit of gta 5 for the pc to opt 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.190
 promises to use as a map no no to cidh 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.530
 is a city so the United States of 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.100
 America on a much smaller scale 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.140
 Of course this is to use gt at 5 seconds 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.390
 this matter state of the united states 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.550
 in the case in the United States with a 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.380
 less or not the whole country is clear 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.680
 how he puts the size of that city 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.570
 of the country a whole game maybe 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.909
 could work but this is not 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.409
 possible letter on then they spoke 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.689
 What could happen in the United States? 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.579
 with reduced scale and rockstar 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.159
 previously revealed the 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.340
 ambition to make a map on this scale 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.979
 but by reviewing the new limitations 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.720
 past generation could not move forward 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.850
 that is, in this matter they are saying that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.340
 Nato was unable to make further progress 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.920
 size of the city because gta5 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.520
 we have currently launched primarily in 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.259
 old generation on ps3 and xbox and 60 on 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 start playing development to be 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.579
 released on xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.590
 a lot even said fucking 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.899
 the game will come out in a mandate as soon as 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.460
 is right on the stalk of ps4 xbox one 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.719
 That's the way it was when you threw 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.780
 that launched a few months ago 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.729
 difference from ps4 xbox or entering the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.410
 market and many people talked for now 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.770
 I think the game will launch the PS4 sewer 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.100
 year 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.960
 only they did not release bruno ps3 xbox 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.080
 saying that cat development and 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.880
 according to them gta5 i could not could not go 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.090
 much more because of the rules of the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.040
 console in case ps3 and xbox of 60 it 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.190
 put getafe to the maximum or 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.950
 the milestone of power could put 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.230
 that the game could stand in the case hadware already 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.180
 not generation they said it went up to 6 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.210
 they will be able to enjoy it very dearly 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.040
 the ps4 xbox radio is much higher and 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.350
 he could not work well over the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.730
 game puts the map much larger with much 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.160
 more thing that you know the ps 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.020
 boston blocks have much potential right 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.690
 according to the same course 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.140
 launch of gta 6 should occur between 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.460
 2018 and 2020 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.460
 until then the rockstar still promises 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.020
 establish lifetime for gta5 by launching 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.180
 free upgrades 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.530
 This is true, this we can not be. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.840
 this matter at the same time as I think 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.230
 that 's fake I think she's true 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.030
 because here he spoke with some details 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.520
 leaked about it which seem to 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.360
 fitting in is even believed 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.370
 switched on 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.340
 because they say that rockstar is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.720
 thinking there are already six of them and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.940
 continue releasing updates 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.610
 free by gta5 and is really what 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.140
 it's happening, it 's turned on to give more 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.240
 projected life so very cool 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.000
 since he left the cup GTA5 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.010
 update one always write it down from the other 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.739
 without being paid are two 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.230
 free updates then for life 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.180
 useful to the game because the naughty pta gta5 and 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.680
 launches new update goes fucking talk 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.600
 There are new cars out there. I'm going to play. 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.239
 forced to walk quite useful life 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.160
 projected to reach 5 to 6 gta I 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.739
 I really hope this happens. 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.360
 who many spoke to is many speak 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.700
 also that today is how it could go 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.890
 if the update is clear it will 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.590
 but it may happen from five hundred gta 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.870
 update until the release was already 6 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.910
 ie the two is to stay 23 years 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.560
 still throws in the update I really 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.230
 I hope this happens because in life 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.400
 Useful for the fucking game is going to stay 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.959
 too fuck this also promised to 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.370
 continuation of the story mode is who is 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.760
 here it is also true that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.970
 was confirmed is the story mode gta 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.480
 5 to 2016 to give more game life 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.320
 also just taken on facebook 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.690
 right 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.460
 So that's it, people, it 's the way it is . 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.570
 according to rumors it is already in 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.130
 development is clear that it is in 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.190
 developing countries to opt even had 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.590
 spoken too and it will leave only for pc 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.720
 and xbox onip 2014 probably because 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.000
 Of course it will not be accepted any more 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.000
 in the old consoles because of hair 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.860
 even if one could even 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.200
 come out man I really believe in what 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.690
 and he always does not leave the old 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.430
 side generation ok then guys 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.230

 let's know if this is true or is done 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.940
 It is in the matter that gta 6 can 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.130
 spending in the United States with this the 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.280
 smallest city connected to the parent 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.170
 United States reduced when connected 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.560
 rockstar announced that it was already in 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.320
