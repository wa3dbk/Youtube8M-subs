more of a charge to your super is also

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.209 
less impactful in PvP the effect of this
is<00:04:46.000> basically<00:04:46.960> getting<00:04:47.319> your<00:04:47.590> supercharged

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
is basically getting your supercharged

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:51.300 
is basically getting your supercharged
in<00:04:48.490> one<00:04:48.819> fewer<00:04:49.330> kills<00:04:49.750> than<00:04:50.080> normal<00:04:50.530> since

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
in one fewer kills than normal since

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.270 
in one fewer kills than normal since
kills<00:04:51.699> come<00:04:52.120> at<00:04:52.330> a<00:04:52.360> slower<00:04:52.780> pace<00:04:52.930> in<00:04:53.500> PvP<00:04:54.069> than

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.939 
kills come at a slower pace in PvP than
they<00:04:54.400> do<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.550> PvE<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.569> since<00:04:56.169> supers<00:04:56.710> are

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
they do in PvE and since supers are

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.909 
they do in PvE and since supers are
normally<00:04:57.490> more<00:04:57.879> strategically<00:04:58.689> used<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.379> PvP

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
normally more strategically used in PvP

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.629 
normally more strategically used in PvP
I<00:05:00.189> just<00:05:00.909> don't<00:05:01.090> find<00:05:01.449> that<00:05:01.599> it's<00:05:01.810> very<00:05:02.050> useful

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
I just don't find that it's very useful

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.459 
I just don't find that it's very useful
so<00:05:03.639> even<00:05:04.000> if<00:05:04.120> you<00:05:04.300> really<00:05:04.810> like<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.169> way<00:05:05.199> this

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
so even if you really like the way this

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.879 
so even if you really like the way this
gun<00:05:05.680> handles<00:05:06.250> in<00:05:06.430> PvP<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.500> think<00:05:08.500> in<00:05:08.680> most

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
gun handles in PvP I think in most

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.679 
gun handles in PvP I think in most
scenarios<00:05:09.159> you<00:05:09.969> would<00:05:10.120> be<00:05:10.270> better<00:05:10.539> off

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
scenarios you would be better off

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.469 
scenarios you would be better off
picking<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.500> legendary<00:05:12.129> pulse<00:05:12.460> rifle<00:05:12.939> with<00:05:13.449> a

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
picking a legendary pulse rifle with a

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.170 
picking a legendary pulse rifle with a
similar<00:05:13.870> damage<00:05:14.349> profile<00:05:15.039> but<00:05:15.400> better<00:05:15.759> perks

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
similar damage profile but better perks

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.490 
similar damage profile but better perks
and<00:05:16.509> saving<00:05:17.349> your<00:05:17.529> exotic<00:05:17.889> for<00:05:18.430> another<00:05:18.819> slot

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
and saving your exotic for another slot

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.670 
and saving your exotic for another slot
