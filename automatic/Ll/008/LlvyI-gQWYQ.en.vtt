have come from and where they're going

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.369 
have come from and where they're going
to<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.600> idea<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> course<00:00:58.260> we

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to get a bit of an idea and of course we

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
to get a bit of an idea and of course we
know<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.680> particular<00:00:59.010> car<00:00:59.430> came<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.059> well

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
know this particular car came out well

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.660 
know this particular car came out well
and<00:01:00.629> truly<00:01:00.780> before<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> WRX<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> would<00:01:02.550> be

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and truly before the WRX but it would be

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.429 
and truly before the WRX but it would be
common<00:01:03.000> sense<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.270> assume<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> when<00:01:04.320> this

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
common sense to assume that when this

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.160 
common sense to assume that when this
car<00:01:04.680> was<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.040> production<00:01:05.510> or<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.780> beginnings

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of its production subaru had a pretty

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.980 
of its production subaru had a pretty
good<00:01:08.790> idea<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.180> where<00:01:09.330> they<00:01:09.450> were<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.720> with

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
good idea of where they were going with

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289

features<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.160> see<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.519> on<00:02:34.670> some<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.940> our

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
features you can see that on some of our

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.110 
features you can see that on some of our
videos<00:02:35.540> as<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:36.140> separate<00:02:36.650> upgrade<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.760> what<00:02:37.970> we

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
videos as a separate upgrade but what we

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.690 
videos as a separate upgrade but what we
wanted<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.480> talk<00:02:38.690> about<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.519> get

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
wanted to talk about is just so you get

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.160 
wanted to talk about is just so you get
a<00:02:40.760> bit<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.120> fresh<00:02:41.299> idea<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.870> what<00:02:42.049> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
a bit of a fresh idea of what the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.809 
a bit of a fresh idea of what the
differences<00:02:42.590> are<00:02:42.739> between<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.190> two<00:02:43.340> cars<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
differences are between the two cars so

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.110 
differences are between the two cars so
let's<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.599> course<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:45.140> both<00:02:45.349> got

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
let's and of course they both got

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.729 
let's and of course they both got
McPherson<00:02:47.120> strut<00:02:47.420> front<00:02:47.780> suspension<00:02:47.870> meaning

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
McPherson strut front suspension meaning

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.370 
McPherson strut front suspension meaning
the<00:02:49.130> strut<00:02:49.459> forms<00:02:50.120> part<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.810> guiding

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
the strut forms part of the guiding

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.490 
the strut forms part of the guiding
function<00:02:51.860> for<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> suspension<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.030> work<00:02:53.500> as

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
function for the suspension to work as

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.069 
function for the suspension to work as
opposed<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:56.030> separate<00:02:56.450> strut<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.049> a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
opposed to just a separate strut and a

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.750 
opposed to just a separate strut and a
separate<00:02:57.440> spring<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.069> let's<00:02:58.250> go<00:02:58.370> around<00:02:58.579> the

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
separate spring so let's go around the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.740 
separate spring so let's go around the
back

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.870 

now<00:03:02.750> really<00:03:03.110> interestingly<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.769> BRZ<00:03:04.069> comes

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
now really interestingly the BRZ comes

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.640 
now really interestingly the BRZ comes
out<00:03:05.120> with<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.269> ventilated<00:03:05.780> rear<00:03:06.110> disc<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.590> of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
out with a ventilated rear disc and of

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.860 
out with a ventilated rear disc and of
course<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:06.980> their<00:03:07.160> upgraded<00:03:07.730> kit<00:03:07.910> ventilated

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
course is their upgraded kit ventilated

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.470 
course is their upgraded kit ventilated
rear<00:03:09.049> disc<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.860> sliding<00:03:10.250> caliper<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:11.599> a

coil<00:03:14.480> over<00:03:14.860> shock<00:03:15.860> absorber<00:03:16.280> now<00:03:16.430> you'll

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
coil over shock absorber now you'll

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.099 
coil over shock absorber now you'll
remember<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> rear<00:03:17.299> of<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.540> car<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
remember and the rear of this car the

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.740 
remember and the rear of this car the
shock<00:03:18.920> absorber<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.639> spring<00:03:20.030> don't<00:03:20.389> form

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
shock absorber and the spring don't form

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.640 
shock absorber and the spring don't form
any<00:03:22.329> guiding<00:03:23.329> function<00:03:23.810> because<00:03:24.200> if<00:03:24.350> you<00:03:24.440> take

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
any guiding function because if you take

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.770 
any guiding function because if you take
that<00:03:24.889> out<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.609> suspension<00:03:26.000> alignment<00:03:26.420> will

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
that out the suspension alignment will

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.210 
that out the suspension alignment will
still<00:03:27.019> remain<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.470> same<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.040> upper
