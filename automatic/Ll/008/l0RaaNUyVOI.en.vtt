why<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.349> the<00:00:01.530> maximum<00:00:01.950> capacity<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.580> to

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
why is the maximum capacity of the to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.599 
why is the maximum capacity of the to
run<00:00:03.060> my<00:00:03.240> airport<00:00:03.720> 68<00:00:04.529> movements<00:00:05.039> an<00:00:05.129> hour<00:00:05.279> and

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
run my airport 68 movements an hour and

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.059 
run my airport 68 movements an hour and
it's<00:00:06.149> mixed<00:00:06.359> mode<00:00:06.629> or<00:00:06.899> segregated<00:00:07.529> mode<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
it's mixed mode or segregated mode a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.100 
it's mixed mode or segregated mode a
better<00:00:08.280> mode<00:00:08.549> of<00:00:08.670> operations<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:09.719> let's<00:00:09.929> look

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
better mode of operations so let's look

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.379 
better mode of operations so let's look
at<00:00:10.349> first<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.889> segregated<00:00:11.219> mode<00:00:11.879> this<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
at first at segregated mode this is

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.780 
at first at segregated mode this is
where<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.679> runway<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.219> takeoff<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
where we have one runway for takeoff and

practical here at Hong Kong because of

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.370 
practical here at Hong Kong because of
the<00:01:10.950> terrain<00:01:11.659> when<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.990> these<00:01:13.170> multiple

the terrain when we have these multiple

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
the terrain when we have these multiple
routes<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.579> we<00:01:14.969> can<00:01:15.149> apply<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.810> lower

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
routes then we can apply a lower

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.889 
routes then we can apply a lower
departure<00:01:16.679> separation<00:01:17.429> and<00:01:17.639> aircraft<00:01:18.630> on

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
different routes can be separated by 60

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.559 
different routes can be separated by 60
seconds<00:01:21.929> or<00:01:22.079> sometimes<00:01:22.859> even<00:01:23.219> less<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> that

seconds or sometimes even less so that

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.569 
seconds or sometimes even less so that
means<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.139> departure<00:01:25.709> capacity<00:01:26.249> at<00:01:26.369> Hong

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
means the departure capacity at Hong

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.609 
means the departure capacity at Hong
Kong<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.719> single<00:01:27.899> departure

Kong because of the single departure

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.160 
Kong because of the single departure
route<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.159> limited<00:01:29.700> by<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> terrain<00:01:30.359> and<00:01:30.719> that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
route is limited by the terrain and that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.529 
route is limited by the terrain and that
gives<00:01:31.380> us<00:01:31.499> a<00:01:31.619> maximum<00:01:31.770> departure<00:01:32.579> capacity<00:01:33.179> of

gives us a maximum departure capacity of

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.830 
gives us a maximum departure capacity of
35<00:01:34.229> movements<00:01:34.799> per<00:01:34.950> hour<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> let's<00:01:36.450> move<00:01:36.600> on

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
35 movements per hour so let's move on

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.419 
35 movements per hour so let's move on

of thirty three arrivals per hour so you

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.180 
of thirty three arrivals per hour so you

can see from the summary here that we

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.980 
can see from the summary here that we

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
of 35 movements an hour so the maximum

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.900 
of 35 movements an hour so the maximum

movements<00:03:07.420> per<00:03:07.570> hour<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.500> let's<00:03:08.680> move<00:03:08.860> on<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340

is just taken off normal separation in
this<00:03:26.080> case<00:03:26.350> would<00:03:26.590> be<00:03:26.710> six<00:03:26.980> miles<00:03:27.220> between<00:03:27.520> the

that's just about to land might need to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.900 
that's just about to land might need to
do<00:03:35.020> what's<00:03:35.260> called<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.650> missed<00:03:35.860> approach<00:03:36.100> that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
do what's called a missed approach that

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.490 
do what's called a missed approach that
could<00:03:37.120> be<00:03:37.270> for<00:03:37.480> whether<00:03:37.690> for<00:03:38.170> technical

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
could be for whether for technical

could be for whether for technical
reasons<00:03:38.620> but<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:39.580> aircraft<00:03:39.700> has<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.300> climb

would be very undesirable here as the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.900 
would be very undesirable here as the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.540 
aircraft would turn towards a mountain
on<00:04:04.030> Lantau<00:04:04.450> Island<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.680> because<00:04:06.070> we<00:04:06.190> have<00:04:06.370> no

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.400 
on Lantau Island so because we have no

choice but the mist approach has to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.350 
choice but the mist approach has to
climb<00:04:08.620> straight<00:04:08.980> ahead<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.520> follow<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.150> same

track as the departing aircraft in this
case<00:04:13.060> we<00:04:13.690> have<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.959> increase<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.770> arrival

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220

separation to eight miles and this means

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.280 
separation to eight miles and this means

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.720 
thing we have to consider in mixed mode
is<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:28.560> need<00:04:28.710> aircraft<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.310> come<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.610> to

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
is that we need aircraft to come in to

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.120 
is that we need aircraft to come in to

we<00:05:30.900> have<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.200> stagger<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.590> aircraft<00:05:32.100> on<00:05:32.280> final

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
we have to stagger the aircraft on final

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.760 
we have to stagger the aircraft on final
approach<00:05:33.000> with<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.570> minimum<00:05:33.960> separation<00:05:34.440> of

approach with a minimum separation of
two<00:05:34.979> miles<00:05:35.250> staggered<00:05:35.940> as<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:37.140> can<00:05:37.290> see<00:05:37.440> that

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
two miles staggered as you can see that

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.230 
two miles staggered as you can see that
brings<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.010> aircraft<00:05:38.400> into<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.729> two<00:05:39.000> runways

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
brings the aircraft into the two runways

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.330 
brings the aircraft into the two runways
staggered<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.140> we<00:05:40.229> can<00:05:40.410> still<00:05:40.590> have<00:05:40.830> a

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
staggered and we can still have a

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.730 
staggered and we can still have a
departing<00:05:42.000> aircraft<00:05:42.150> in<00:05:42.720> between<00:05:43.200> them<00:05:43.410> as

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
departing aircraft in between them as

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.700 
departing aircraft in between them as
you<00:05:44.610> saw<00:05:44.820> in<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.060> last<00:05:45.180> picture<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:46.200> capacity

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
you saw in the last picture the capacity

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.250 
you saw in the last picture the capacity
of<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.919> South<00:05:47.160> runway<00:05:47.400> in<00:05:47.729> mixed<00:05:48.030> mode<00:05:48.240> is<00:05:48.570> 34

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
of the South runway in mixed mode is 34

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.190 
of the South runway in mixed mode is 34
movements<00:05:49.770> an<00:05:49.860> hour<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.610> therefore<00:05:51.120> we<00:05:51.510> get<00:05:51.600> 34

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
movements an hour so therefore we get 34

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.170 
movements an hour so therefore we get 34
movements<00:05:52.680> on<00:05:52.770> each<00:05:52.890> runway<00:05:53.190> which<00:05:53.790> gives<00:05:54.060> us

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
movements on each runway which gives us

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.070 
movements on each runway which gives us
a<00:05:54.270> total<00:05:54.450> of<00:05:54.840> 68<00:05:55.290> movements<00:05:55.860> per<00:05:56.040> hour<00:05:56.930> if<00:05:57.930> we

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
a total of 68 movements per hour if we

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.110 
a total of 68 movements per hour if we
go<00:05:58.229> on<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.380> look<00:05:58.590> at<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.830> summary<00:05:59.220> of<00:05:59.340> this<00:05:59.490> you
