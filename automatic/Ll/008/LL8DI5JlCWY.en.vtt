looks kind of awkward but it's a great
exercise<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.090> beginning<00:01:15.450> you'll<00:01:15.570> be

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
exercise in the beginning you'll be

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.890 
exercise in the beginning you'll be
really<00:01:15.930> wobbly<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.680> okay<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
really wobbly that's okay you have to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719
