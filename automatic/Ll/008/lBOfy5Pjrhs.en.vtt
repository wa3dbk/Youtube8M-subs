get<00:06:26.020> it<00:06:26.319> is<00:06:26.500> a<00:06:26.530> part<00:06:26.860> of<00:06:26.949> the<00:06:27.039> regular<00:06:27.219> line<00:06:27.430> so

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
get it is a part of the regular line so

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.600 
get it is a part of the regular line so
you<00:06:27.789> can't<00:06:28.090> pick<00:06:28.210> it<00:06:28.270> up<00:06:28.360> anytime<00:06:28.630> so<00:06:29.289> it

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
you can't pick it up anytime so it

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.719
