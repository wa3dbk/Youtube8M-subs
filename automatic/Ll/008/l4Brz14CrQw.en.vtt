you will notice um on this run up the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.749 
you will notice um on this run up the
mountain<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:45.220> only<00:01:45.640> use<00:01:46.000> one<00:01:46.509> crab<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
mountain that I only use one crab the

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.749 
mountain that I only use one crab the
next<00:01:49.750> time<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.229> go<00:01:50.409> up<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.710> i'll<00:01:51.040> be<00:01:51.220> using<00:01:51.399> two

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
next time I go up it i'll be using two

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.779 
next time I go up it i'll be using two
so<00:01:52.270> if<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:53.289> want<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.590> see<00:01:53.860> how<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.640> with

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
so if you want to see how to do it with

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.870 
so if you want to see how to do it with
two<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.869> is<00:01:56.020> easier<00:01:56.410> I<00:01:56.679> completely<00:01:57.520> forgot

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
two it is easier I completely forgot

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.080 
two it is easier I completely forgot
that<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.119> could<00:01:58.300> use<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:59.490> until<00:02:00.490> my<00:02:00.729> second

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
that you could use to until my second

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.249 
that you could use to until my second
time<00:02:01.210> around<00:02:01.270> but<00:02:01.830> either<00:02:02.830> way<00:02:03.190> words<00:02:04.259> you

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
time around but either way words you

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.779 
time around but either way words you
should<00:02:05.289> do<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.800> just<00:02:05.979> a<00:02:06.130> little<00:02:06.340> bit<00:02:06.550> faster

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
should do is just a little bit faster

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.790 
should do is just a little bit faster
and<00:02:07.300> easier<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.890> least<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.399> little<00:02:09.519> while

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
he's off the screen pretty much he stops

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.890 
he's off the screen pretty much he stops
moving<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:24.549> you<00:02:24.940> really<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.209> have<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.720> inch

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
it back on the screen will notice here

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.820 
it back on the screen will notice here
that<00:03:10.460> you<00:03:10.820> can<00:03:11.030> stand<00:03:11.540> inside<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.320> cliff<00:03:12.620> a

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
that you can stand inside this cliff a

that you can stand inside this cliff a
little<00:03:13.040> bit<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:14.420> not<00:03:14.480> too<00:03:14.720> much<00:03:14.900> or<00:03:15.320> you'll<00:03:15.470> be

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
little bit but not too much or you'll be

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.170

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
tip so a lot of big the OPA gated by

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.280 
tip so a lot of big the OPA gated by
those<00:04:27.380> but<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:29.450> want<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.630> conserve<00:04:30.050> as<00:04:30.260> much

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
those but you want to conserve as much

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.850 
those but you want to conserve as much
energy<00:04:30.530> as<00:04:30.950> possible<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.640> you're<00:04:31.820> low<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.860> don't

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
energy as possible if you're low I don't

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.460 
energy as possible if you're low I don't
know<00:04:33.950> this<00:04:34.490> part<00:04:34.730> here<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.270> take<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.630> long<00:04:36.140> time

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
know this part here I take a long time

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.510 
know this part here I take a long time
getting<00:04:36.770> out<00:04:36.890> I<00:04:37.190> really<00:04:37.520> don't<00:04:37.640> need<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:40.400> is

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
getting out I really don't need to it is

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.330 
getting out I really don't need to it is
difficult<00:04:40.760> though<00:04:41.200> because<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:43.550> can't<00:04:45.340> get

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
difficult though because you can't get

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.130 
difficult though because you can't get
out<00:04:46.490> of<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.700> quicksand<00:04:47.180> without<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:47.750> gravity

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
out of the quicksand without the gravity

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.280 
out of the quicksand without the gravity
suit<00:04:48.880> unless<00:04:49.880> you're<00:04:50.390> in<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.690> little

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
suit unless you're in the little

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.380 
suit unless you're in the little
waterfalls<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.400> that's<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.060> only<00:04:53.210> way<00:04:53.330> you

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
waterfalls and that's the only way you

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.810 
waterfalls and that's the only way you
move<00:04:53.630> upwards<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.229> you<00:04:54.290> pretty<00:04:54.530> much<00:04:54.669> if<00:04:55.669> you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
move upwards so you pretty much if you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.100 
move upwards so you pretty much if you
try<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.030> jump<00:04:56.419> out<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.740> sand

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
try to jump out of the sand

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.410 
try to jump out of the sand
in<00:04:59.770> any<00:04:59.980> other<00:05:00.070> area<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:00.760> just<00:05:01.000> sink<00:05:01.240> down

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
in any other area you just sink down

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.120 
in any other area you just sink down
farther<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.220> kind<00:05:03.640> of<00:05:03.700> have<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:03.910> be

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
farther so you kind of have to be

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:14.490 
farther so you kind of have to be
departing<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:08.620> quicksand<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:12.360> be<00:05:13.360> but<00:05:14.200> still

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
departing the quicksand and be but still

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.380 
departing the quicksand and be but still
be<00:05:14.620> in<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.920> little<00:05:15.190> quicksand<00:05:15.790> waterfall

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
be in that little quicksand waterfall

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.150 
be in that little quicksand waterfall
you<00:05:16.570> know<00:05:16.690> what<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.810> mean<00:05:16.930> same<00:05:17.530> time<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.100> in

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
you know what I mean same time and in

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.050 
you know what I mean same time and in
the<00:05:18.250> corner<00:05:19.380> this<00:05:20.380> part<00:05:20.650> here<00:05:20.920> it's<00:05:21.250> really

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
the corner this part here it's really

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.330 
the corner this part here it's really
difficult<00:05:22.390> to<00:05:22.960> get<00:05:23.140> out<00:05:23.290> of<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.470> water<00:05:23.680> you

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
difficult to get out of the water you

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.490 
difficult to get out of the water you
have<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.610> be<00:05:24.730> wall<00:05:24.910> jumping<00:05:25.270> pretty<00:05:25.480> much<00:05:25.630> as

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
have to be wall jumping pretty much as

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.020 
have to be wall jumping pretty much as
fast<00:05:26.770> as<00:05:27.010> possible<00:05:27.250> back<00:05:27.730> and<00:05:27.940> forth<00:05:29.850> as<00:05:30.850> soon

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
fast as possible back and forth as soon

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.190 
fast as possible back and forth as soon
as<00:05:31.150> you're<00:05:31.330> able<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.780> you're<00:05:31.960> pretty<00:05:32.170> much

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
as you're able to you're pretty much

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.070 
as you're able to you're pretty much
just<00:05:33.120> pounding<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.210> left<00:05:34.240> or<00:05:34.570> right<00:05:34.600> buttons

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
just pounding the left or right buttons

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.680 
just pounding the left or right buttons
and<00:05:35.380> jump<00:05:35.740> buttons<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.970> hoping<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.600> you

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and jump buttons and hoping that you

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.320 
and jump buttons and hoping that you
make<00:05:40.840> it<00:05:40.960> out<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.080> here<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:42.700> catch<00:05:43.060> yourself

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
make it out of here and catch yourself
