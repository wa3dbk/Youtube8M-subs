00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.799
 well it turns him 7.6 today 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.770
 is found for the technical game number 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.490
 13 already and it's already the end for these 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.039
 technical games 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.420
 it's the very last episode then 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.400
 I hope that throughout these 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.930
 episodes will know how to help like the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.859
 little tips and tricks it would do 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 really happy 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.840
 in any case it's true it will not help 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.820
 bad of words for fifa 13 and I hope that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 it will do the same for fifa 14 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.559
 so here I advise you to take 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 cristiano ronado to throw this game 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.040
 technical shots on goal then the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.260
 bronze level is very easy it takes 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.989
 just touch the small targets that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.930
 are in front of you in addition to they you 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.149
 leave all the time there the small area 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.120
 blue to indicate where you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.410
 shoot in Corsican they would have removed it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.820
 was complicated but there they remove 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.489
 really not so it's really very 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.260
 simple just be careful 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.060
 also in the skylights not too much 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 to overtake and also soffons down 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.619
 so I really hope it will have you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.689
 helped all and I fight all and if I all 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.900
 his advisers tricks that I could you 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.570
 give in his episode traits when 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 even it's really quite a lot 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.880
 episodes so I 'll try to get them from you 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.829
 really all a little bit at the same 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.549
 time ie the same day where 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.549
 really it 's one day and 6 on the other 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.400
 something like that but I was hoping to 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.070
 wanted to put the fastest 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.990
 possible to help my a maximum of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.759
 people because I know there are some 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.799
 not bad who tries to make the games 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.700
 techniques either for the trophies or 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.100
 either by competition from your friends 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.619
 that it's up to each of them 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 I can do a lot but that's fine 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.530
 still a lot of time that I 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.719
 command since I commented on the 13 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 episodes at the same time so that makes a 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.740
 little buggy 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.509
 good let's get to the money level so the one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.269
 really very simple 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.939
 you have to do fin and after 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.230
 you wheel when I say art we got 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.019
 really gently you do not have to shoot 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.459
 as a barbarian and after you have that to 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.989
 target the targets and normand that should 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.209
 very easily 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.290
 here I still have some ass 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.549
 because I do not think it had 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.480
 market you leave falling but 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.409
 finally it works 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.120
 and there at huy for the last exhibition 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.190
 so I advise you to leave it 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.030
 to quote because you just have 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.739
 pressed all the way to the bottom left and bottom 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.690
 in any case that's what I did there 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.609
 I pressed all the way to the left and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.849
 ambages I did not stop 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.420
 maintain that and it's all back 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.690
 simply 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.049
 I even won a little trophy you see 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.879
 good we'll go to the gold level so the 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.639
 gold level it's pretty much the same 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.400
 principle that the bronze level that 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.379
 had to do actually pass ya still 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.879
 targets to touch then there I know 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.540
 not what I read the veil me 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.400
 I had to say that except that there you have to re 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.030
 pressed on rank when he's ready to 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.440
 shoot 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.379
 actually must press twice 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.620
 once when you pull for the gauge 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.199
 green and after once to stop 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.169
 we're going to say his little run and that the 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:29.650
 targets comes on and after for really 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.480
 have a good timing and a good reflex 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.370
 to target the right targets 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.150
 is funny it must go very 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.000
 easily 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.919
 so here I hope that all his 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.959
 technical hair in any case 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:43.810
 advise tricks that I could you 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.370
 give you will have helped do not hesitate to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.049
 put that in the comments to 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.389
