00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.030 

so<00:02:27.629> here<00:02:27.870> we're<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.110> using<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.680> smaller

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
so here we're just using a smaller

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.440 
so here we're just using a smaller
reflector<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.879> with<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.239> same

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
reflector and then with the same

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.710 
reflector and then with the same
principle<00:02:33.959> where<00:02:34.110> she<00:02:34.379> begins<00:02:35.030> then<00:02:36.030> we<00:02:36.269> begin

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
principle where she begins then we begin

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.729 
principle where she begins then we begin
the<00:02:37.159> reflector<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:40.260> feather<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
the reflector and just feather in the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.580 
the reflector and just feather in the
light<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.310> little<00:02:41.519> bit<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:45.230> step<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:46.379> lean

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
light just a little bit a step so lean

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.410 
light just a little bit a step so lean
in<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.040> side<00:02:47.280> just<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.579> little<00:02:47.610> more<00:02:47.970> right

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
in on this side just a little more right

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:58.550 
in on this side just a little more right
there<00:02:48.659> that's<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:58.230> pull<00:02:58.440> that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
there that's here like you you pull that
