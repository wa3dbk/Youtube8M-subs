00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:18.500 

this<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.440> strida<00:00:10.440> links<00:00:15.710> look<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:17.510> it's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
this is how strida links look like it's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.340 
this is how strida links look like it's
a<00:00:18.690> big<00:00:19.130> movement<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.490> legs<00:00:20.730> forward<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.960> back

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
a big movement of legs forward and back

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:47.850 
a big movement of legs forward and back
and<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.000> how<00:00:24.439> those<00:00:25.439> methods<00:00:25.920> look<00:00:26.279> like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.110 

I<00:00:47.920> guess<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.930> two<00:00:50.140> examples<00:00:50.650> would<00:00:50.980> be<00:00:51.120> good

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
I guess this two examples would be good

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.170 
I guess this two examples would be good
enough<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.420> understand<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:54.180> difference

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
enough to understand the difference

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.720 
enough to understand the difference
between<00:00:56.430> range<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.580> motion<00:00:58.560> in<00:00:59.580> running<00:01:00.580> and

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
between range of motion in running and

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.150 
between range of motion in running and
range<00:01:01.600> of<00:01:01.720> motion<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.320> pose<00:01:02.590> method<00:01:02.860> of

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
range of motion and pose method of

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.480 
range of motion and pose method of
running<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.260> see<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:06.970> quite<00:01:08.490> big

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
running as you see there is quite big

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.270 
running as you see there is quite big
distinguishing<00:01:10.240> point<00:01:10.540> for<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.680> legs

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
distinguishing point for this that legs

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.960 
distinguishing point for this that legs
do<00:01:12.460> not<00:01:12.610> move<00:01:12.790> forward<00:01:13.660> and<00:01:13.810> back<00:01:14.970> they're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
do not move forward and back they're

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.310 
do not move forward and back they're
moving<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:17.650> and<00:01:17.920> down<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> major<00:01:19.960> thing

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
moving up and down this is a major thing

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.219 
moving up and down this is a major thing

under the hip and what do you see a

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.890 
under the hip and what do you see a
little<00:01:52.090> bit<00:01:52.210> always<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:53.040> straight<00:01:54.040> line<00:01:54.340> is

little bit always this straight line is

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.590 
little bit always this straight line is
just<00:01:55.900> again<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.920> same<00:01:57.130> thing<00:01:57.400> momentum<00:01:58.330> or

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
just again the same thing momentum or

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.010 
just again the same thing momentum or
inertia<00:01:59.409> which<00:01:59.830> build<00:02:00.549> up<00:02:01.020> resultant

but<00:02:12.959> different<00:02:14.370> very<00:02:15.370> obvious<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.810> can

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
but different very obvious and you can

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.910 
but different very obvious and you can
see<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.650> clip<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.170> what<00:02:20.530> we<00:02:20.680> supposed

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
see it in the clip so what we supposed

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.940 
see it in the clip so what we supposed
to<00:02:21.190> do<00:02:21.310> there<00:02:21.660> we<00:02:22.660> have<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.900> again<00:02:23.230> build<00:02:23.530> our

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
to do there we have to again build our

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.539 
to do there we have to again build our
perception<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.090> foot<00:02:25.709> supposed<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.980> move

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
perception that foot supposed to move

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.050 
perception that foot supposed to move
only<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.989> vertical<00:02:29.560> line<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:30.880> the

ground<00:02:31.299> under<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.959> hip<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:32.920> our<00:02:33.100> perception

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
ground under the hip it's our perception

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.090 
ground under the hip it's our perception
or<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:35.709> can<00:02:35.920> call<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:37.299> structure<00:02:38.100> which

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
or you can call it the structure which

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.699 
or you can call it the structure which
is<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.820> psychological<00:02:40.480> structure<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.380> the
