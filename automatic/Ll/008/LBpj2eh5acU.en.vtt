question<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.740> it's<00:01:22.009> one<00:01:22.220> thing<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.369> came<00:01:22.430> to

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610

question and it's one thing I came to
think<00:01:22.850> about<00:01:23.119> for<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.330> while<00:01:23.509> because<00:01:23.990> they

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
think about for a while because they

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.050 
think about for a while because they
didn't<00:01:24.350> really<00:01:24.470> know<00:01:24.800> but<00:01:25.460> having<00:01:25.850> thought

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
didn't really know but having thought

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.180 
didn't really know but having thought
about<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.539> I<00:01:26.720> think<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:27.860> probably

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
about it I think it it's probably

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.310 
about it I think it it's probably
because<00:01:28.820> they<00:01:29.570> wanted<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:29.930> tell<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.289> story

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
because they wanted to tell the story

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.350 
because they wanted to tell the story
first<00:01:30.979> of<00:01:31.130> all<00:01:31.250> regarding<00:01:31.399> Niko<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.240> his

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
first of all regarding Niko and his

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.719 
first of all regarding Niko and his
nationality<00:01:33.170> or<00:01:33.200> at<00:01:33.500> least<00:01:33.680> his<00:01:34.009> ethnic

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
nationality or at least his ethnic

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.639 
nationality or at least his ethnic
origin<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.479> think<00:01:35.899> they<00:01:35.960> wanted<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.350> tell<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
origin I think they wanted to tell the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.380 
origin I think they wanted to tell the
story<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:37.070> someone<00:01:37.310> who<00:01:37.430> comes<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.850> America

story of someone who comes to America
without<00:01:38.570> ever<00:01:38.930> having<00:01:39.200> been<00:01:39.380> there<00:01:39.800> before

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
without ever having been there before

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.520 
without ever having been there before
and<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:41.210> they<00:01:41.360> encounter<00:01:41.930> when<00:01:42.170> they<00:01:42.320> come

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
and what they encounter when they come

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.910 
and what they encounter when they come
over<00:01:42.680> here<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.420> obviously<00:01:44.420> Niko's<00:01:45.320> first

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
over here and obviously Niko's first

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.650 
over here and obviously Niko's first

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
think that he encounters are these

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.480 
think that he encounters are these
Russian<00:01:48.140> gangsters<00:01:48.679> who<00:01:48.860> are<00:01:48.950> very<00:01:49.160> cold

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
Russian gangsters who are very cold

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.870

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
blooded I won't go on into the rest of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.580 
blooded I won't go on into the rest of
the<00:01:53.030> storyline<00:01:53.509> but<00:01:53.689> you<00:01:53.869> know<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:54.200> happens

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
the storyline but you know what happens

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.490 
the storyline but you know what happens
later<00:01:54.860> on<00:01:54.979> regarding<00:01:55.909> Dmitry<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.110> all<00:01:57.229> that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
later on regarding Dmitry and all that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
later on regarding Dmitry and all that
and<00:01:58.600> what's-his-face<00:01:59.600> Mika<00:02:00.350> Faust<00:02:00.650> and<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
and what's-his-face Mika Faust and so I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.190 
and what's-his-face Mika Faust and so I
think<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.150> they<00:02:02.240> really<00:02:02.270> wanted<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.930> crush

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
hyping up the American Dream talking

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.490 
hyping up the American Dream talking
about<00:02:13.940> how<00:02:14.030> Great<00:02:14.269> America<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.200> Niko

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
about how Great America is and the Niko

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.009 
about how Great America is and the Niko
realizes<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.430> really<00:02:17.299> shit<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.900> that

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
realizes that it's really shit and that

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.170 
realizes that it's really shit and that
the<00:02:18.799> first<00:02:19.010> thing<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.250> he<00:02:19.430> encounters<00:02:20.030> are

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the first thing that he encounters are

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.120 
the first thing that he encounters are
these<00:02:20.329> Russians<00:02:20.810> who<00:02:21.049> do<00:02:21.440> business<00:02:21.920> really

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
these Russians who do business really

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.520 
these Russians who do business really
shoddily<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.060> all<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.360> kind<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.720> thing<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.500> I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
shoddily and all that kind of thing so I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.380 
shoddily and all that kind of thing so I
think<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.950> was<00:02:25.160> their<00:02:25.340> main<00:02:25.610> goal<00:02:26.060> there

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
think that was their main goal there

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.000 
think that was their main goal there
they<00:02:26.540> really<00:02:26.750> wanted<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.200> as<00:02:27.410> they<00:02:27.650> crushed

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
they really wanted to as they crushed

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.310 
they really wanted to as they crushed
the<00:02:28.190> American<00:02:28.610> Dream<00:02:28.820> into<00:02:29.239> smithereens<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
the American Dream into smithereens the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.410 
the American Dream into smithereens the
best<00:02:30.470> way<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.070> was<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> have<00:02:31.700> these

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
best way to do that was to have these

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.509 
best way to do that was to have these
Russians<00:02:33.019> also<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.500> Albanians<00:02:34.100> about<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
Russians also the Albanians about the

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.789 
Russians also the Albanians about the
place<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.090> just<00:02:35.120> showed<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:36.380> really

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
place and just showed that it's really

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.289 
place and just showed that it's really
not<00:02:36.920> all<00:02:36.980> it's<00:02:37.370> cracked<00:02:37.430> up<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.850> be<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.150> think

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
not all it's cracked up to be I think

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.800 
not all it's cracked up to be I think
that<00:02:38.480> was<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.900> main<00:02:39.530> goal<00:02:39.829> there<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:40.810> blaze

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
that was the main goal there now blaze

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.780 
that was the main goal there now blaze
Marchon<00:02:42.440> asked<00:02:42.650> me<00:02:42.829> two<00:02:42.980> questions<00:02:43.010> first<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
Marchon asked me two questions first of

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.430 
Marchon asked me two questions first of
all<00:02:43.880> he<00:02:43.970> asked<00:02:44.090> me<00:02:44.299> does<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.690> have<00:02:44.959> anger

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
all he asked me does that have anger

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.890 
all he asked me does that have anger
issues<00:02:45.470> well<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.370> don't<00:02:46.760> think<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.180> has<00:02:47.390> anger

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
issues well I don't think that has anger

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.650 
issues well I don't think that has anger
issues<00:02:48.200> as<00:02:48.410> such<00:02:48.799> but<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.970> think<00:02:50.329> it's<00:02:50.480> just

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
issues as such but I think it's just

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.250 
issues as such but I think it's just
because<00:02:51.160> he<00:02:52.160> takes<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.209> much<00:02:53.329> cocaine<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.079> think

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
because he takes so much cocaine I think

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.210 
because he takes so much cocaine I think
that's<00:02:54.380> what<00:02:54.560> makes<00:02:54.709> him<00:02:54.889> act<00:02:55.010> really

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that's what makes him act really

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.159 
that's what makes him act really
erratically<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:56.510> you'll<00:02:56.720> see<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.019> with

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
erratically like you'll see that with

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.670 
erratically like you'll see that with
Ken<00:02:57.380> Rosenberg<00:02:57.829> of<00:02:58.130> GTA<00:02:58.430> vice<00:02:58.669> sity<00:02:58.970> he<00:02:59.180> acts

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
Ken Rosenberg of GTA vice sity he acts

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.170 
Ken Rosenberg of GTA vice sity he acts
absolutely<00:03:00.040> crazy<00:03:00.250> whenever<00:03:00.819> he's<00:03:01.000> on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
absolutely crazy whenever he's on

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.149 
absolutely crazy whenever he's on
cocaine<00:03:01.719> so<00:03:02.379> I<00:03:02.409> think<00:03:02.590> it's<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:02.920> same<00:03:03.129> thing

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
cocaine so I think it's the same thing

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.520 
cocaine so I think it's the same thing
that's<00:03:03.640> why<00:03:03.730> Bob<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.329> acting<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:04.870> weird<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.409> so

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
that's why Bob is acting so weird and so

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.259 
that's why Bob is acting so weird and so
aggressive<00:03:06.099> towards<00:03:06.430> Nikko<00:03:06.849> I<00:03:06.879> think<00:03:07.150> it's

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
aggressive towards Nikko I think it's

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.670 
aggressive towards Nikko I think it's
just<00:03:07.329> because<00:03:07.540> he's<00:03:07.840> on<00:03:08.019> drugs

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
just because he's on drugs

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.679 
just because he's on drugs
so<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.400> were<00:03:09.519> told<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.939> baby<00:03:10.150> he<00:03:10.390> would<00:03:10.510> be

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
so if you were told the baby he would be

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.990 
so if you were told the baby he would be
a<00:03:10.719> bit<00:03:10.900> more<00:03:11.140> calm<00:03:11.439> or<00:03:11.709> not<00:03:11.799> reassure<00:03:12.310> but

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
a bit more calm or not reassure but

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.849 
a bit more calm or not reassure but
that's<00:03:13.269> how<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.480> see<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.900> anyway<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.409> that's

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
that's how I see it anyway so that's

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.459 
that's how I see it anyway so that's
that<00:03:15.189> and<00:03:15.670> ask<00:03:15.849> me<00:03:15.969> what<00:03:16.120> do<00:03:16.239> I<00:03:16.299> like<00:03:16.510> about<00:03:16.540> gt4

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:17.469 
that and ask me what do I like about gt4

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:19.830 
that and ask me what do I like about gt4
well<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:18.010> could<00:03:18.639> end<00:03:18.790> up<00:03:18.879> going<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.569> while

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
well I could end up going on for a while

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.929 
well I could end up going on for a while
here<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:20.319> I'm<00:03:20.379> gonna<00:03:20.469> try<00:03:20.680> not<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:21.670> I

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
here but I'm gonna try not to but I

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.569 
here but I'm gonna try not to but I
don't<00:03:22.840> know<00:03:23.049> just<00:03:23.319> eat<00:03:23.530> April<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:23.950> think<00:03:24.040> what<00:03:24.549> I

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
don't know just eat April I think what I

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.610 
don't know just eat April I think what I
like<00:03:24.760> about<00:03:24.909> it<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:26.230> have<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.379> main

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
like about it is that you have a main

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.259 
like about it is that you have a main
character<00:03:26.859> whom<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.519> really<00:03:27.849> sympathize

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
character whom you can really sympathize

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.599 
character whom you can really sympathize
with<00:03:28.719> someone<00:03:29.469> whom<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.069> can<00:03:30.219> really<00:03:30.370> get

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
with someone whom you can really get

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.429 
with someone whom you can really get
behind<00:03:30.639> I<00:03:31.359> personally<00:03:31.780> think<00:03:31.930> Nico<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.409> a

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
behind I personally think Nico is a

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:34.199 
behind I personally think Nico is a
great<00:03:32.709> main<00:03:33.069> character<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:33.849> you<00:03:33.970> just

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
great main character because you just

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.059 
great main character because you just
feel<00:03:34.510> sorry<00:03:34.930> for<00:03:35.049> when<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:35.409> just<00:03:35.439> wanted<00:03:36.040> to

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
feel sorry for when you just wanted to

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.000 
feel sorry for when you just wanted to
be<00:03:36.549> not<00:03:37.299> safe<00:03:37.780> exactly<00:03:38.439> but<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.650> want<00:03:38.799> things

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
be not safe exactly but you want things

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.490 
be not safe exactly but you want things
to<00:03:39.099> turn<00:03:39.129> out<00:03:39.430> well<00:03:39.459> for<00:03:39.819> him<00:03:39.970> he's<00:03:40.419> a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
to turn out well for him he's a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.960 
to turn out well for him he's a
sympathetic<00:03:41.500> kind<00:03:41.859> of<00:03:41.980> character<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.519> suppose

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
sympathetic kind of character I suppose

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.539 
sympathetic kind of character I suppose
so<00:03:43.359> that's<00:03:43.569> one<00:03:43.720> thing<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:44.019> like<00:03:44.169> about<00:03:44.200> it

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
so that's one thing I like about it

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.490 
so that's one thing I like about it
another<00:03:45.549> thing<00:03:45.819> is<00:03:45.969> that<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.629> mixes<00:03:47.079> a<00:03:47.109> lot<00:03:47.349> of

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
another thing is that it mixes a lot of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.099 
another thing is that it mixes a lot of
humor<00:03:48.010> with<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.760> kind<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.419> dark<00:03:49.719> gloomy

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
humor with a kind of a dark gloomy

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.839 
humor with a kind of a dark gloomy
atmosphere<00:03:50.439> and<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.069> love<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.459> kind<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.790> thing

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
atmosphere and I love that kind of thing

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.089 
atmosphere and I love that kind of thing
it<00:03:52.209> has<00:03:52.329> a<00:03:52.359> lot<00:03:52.689> of<00:03:52.719> gallows<00:03:53.260> humor<00:03:53.709> in<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:54.040> I

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
it has a lot of gallows humor in and I

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.789 
it has a lot of gallows humor in and I
think<00:03:54.159> and<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:55.359> like<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:55.989> kind<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.379> humor<00:03:56.769> I

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
think and I like that kind of humor I

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.500 
think and I like that kind of humor I
suppose<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.549> that's<00:03:57.700> another<00:03:57.939> thing<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.299> like

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
suppose so that's another thing I like

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.809 
suppose so that's another thing I like
about<00:03:58.540> this<00:03:58.930> game<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.500> as<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.400> said<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:00.669> think

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
about this game and as I said I think

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.610 
about this game and as I said I think
the<00:04:01.000> main<00:04:01.180> thing<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.419> though<00:04:01.629> is<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.590> can

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
the main thing is though is that you can

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.589 
the main thing is though is that you can
really<00:04:02.980> get<00:04:03.099> emotionally<00:04:03.760> invested<00:04:04.299> in<00:04:04.419> this

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
really get emotionally invested in this

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.180 
really get emotionally invested in this
game<00:04:04.720> that's<00:04:05.199> probably<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> most<00:04:05.769> fulfilling

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
game that's probably the most fulfilling

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.550 
game that's probably the most fulfilling
aspect<00:04:06.729> of<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.209> think<00:04:07.569> because<00:04:08.079> most<00:04:08.409> of

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
aspect of and I think because most of

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.319 
aspect of and I think because most of
the<00:04:08.680> characters<00:04:09.069> just<00:04:09.159> seem<00:04:09.430> very<00:04:09.459> real<00:04:09.970> they

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
the characters just seem very real they

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.210 
the characters just seem very real they
their<00:04:11.109> character<00:04:11.470> but<00:04:11.680> who<00:04:11.799> was<00:04:11.979> to<00:04:12.010> say<00:04:12.190> you

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
their character but who was to say you

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.219 
their character but who was to say you
can<00:04:12.489> really<00:04:12.699> sympathize<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.690> that's<00:04:14.049> one

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
can really sympathize and that's one

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.780 
can really sympathize and that's one
thing<00:04:14.349> I<00:04:14.470> would<00:04:14.560> criticize<00:04:14.949> about<00:04:15.069> GTA<00:04:15.519> 5

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
thing I would criticize about GTA 5

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.909 
thing I would criticize about GTA 5
although<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.750> does<00:04:16.900> have<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.199> same<00:04:17.440> kind<00:04:17.769> of

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
although it does have the same kind of

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.740 
although it does have the same kind of
effect<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.459> me<00:04:18.699> it's<00:04:18.880> not<00:04:19.060> as<00:04:19.239> strong<00:04:19.539> with

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
effect on me it's not as strong with

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.560 
effect on me it's not as strong with
this<00:04:19.900> game<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:21.250> think<00:04:21.310> that's<00:04:21.729> because<00:04:21.940> of

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
this game and I think that's because of

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.730 
this game and I think that's because of
the<00:04:22.780> fact<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.169> have<00:04:23.289> to<00:04:23.349> switch<00:04:23.590> between

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
the fact that you have to switch between

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.439 
the fact that you have to switch between
three<00:04:23.979> characters<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.880> don't<00:04:25.060> get<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.330> build

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
three characters you don't get to build

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.540 
three characters you don't get to build
up<00:04:25.690> as<00:04:25.810> much<00:04:25.930> of<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.199> rapport<00:04:26.620> with<00:04:26.860> those

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
up as much of a rapport with those

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.219 
up as much of a rapport with those
characters<00:04:28.090> as<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.330> do<00:04:28.449> with<00:04:28.599> Nico's<00:04:29.020> since

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
characters as you do with Nico's since

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.210 
characters as you do with Nico's since
you're<00:04:29.320> playing<00:04:29.560> with<00:04:29.650> him<00:04:29.830> for<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.070> entire

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
you're playing with him for the entire

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.490 
you're playing with him for the entire
game<00:04:30.669> but<00:04:31.270> that's<00:04:31.599> just<00:04:31.690> my<00:04:31.870> opinion<00:04:31.900> anyway

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
game but that's just my opinion anyway

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.960 
game but that's just my opinion anyway
but<00:04:32.740> that's<00:04:32.889> those<00:04:33.340> are<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.550> main<00:04:33.699> things

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
but that's those are the main things

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.379 
but that's those are the main things
which<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.270> like<00:04:34.449> about<00:04:34.599> GTA<00:04:35.500> 4<00:04:35.830> now<00:04:36.389> Slayer

he's trying to stop gambling but and he
keeps<00:05:18.310> gambling<00:05:18.850> anyway<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.210> thinks<00:05:19.509> it's<00:05:19.810> a

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
keeps gambling anyway I thinks it's a

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.110 
keeps gambling anyway I thinks it's a
thing<00:05:20.110> with<00:05:20.289> women<00:05:20.470> essentially<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.520> even

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
thing with women essentially so even

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.969 
thing with women essentially so even
though<00:05:22.210> he<00:05:22.360> finds<00:05:22.569> a<00:05:22.690> great<00:05:22.870> girl<00:05:23.139> in<00:05:23.319> Mallory

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
though he finds a great girl in Mallory

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.249 
though he finds a great girl in Mallory
he<00:05:24.400> still<00:05:24.699> likes<00:05:25.000> live<00:05:25.330> this<00:05:25.479> life<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.840> excess

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
he still likes live this life of excess

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.050 
he still likes live this life of excess
he's<00:05:26.470> still<00:05:26.650> going<00:05:26.889> to<00:05:27.099> clubs<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.610> all<00:05:27.759> that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
he's still going to clubs and all that

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.670 
he's still going to clubs and all that
he's<00:05:28.300> still<00:05:28.509> trying<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.960> live<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.199> American

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
he's still trying to live the American

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.860 
he's still trying to live the American
dream<00:05:29.889> essentially<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.360> think<00:05:31.569> that<00:05:31.780> that's

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
dream essentially so I think that that's

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.830 
dream essentially so I think that that's
a<00:05:32.050> big<00:05:32.259> deal<00:05:32.860> for<00:05:33.280> him<00:05:33.669> and<00:05:34.090> also<00:05:34.330> think<00:05:34.750> it's

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
a big deal for him and also think it's

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.960 
a big deal for him and also think it's
because<00:05:35.110> he<00:05:35.410> mentioned<00:05:35.770> that<00:05:35.889> he<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.669> Mallory

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
because he mentioned that he and Mallory

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.120 
because he mentioned that he and Mallory
have<00:05:37.180> an<00:05:37.270> open<00:05:37.599> relationship<00:05:37.750> so<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.949> think

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
have an open relationship so I think

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.360 
have an open relationship so I think
he's<00:05:39.520> I<00:05:39.849> think<00:05:40.509> he's<00:05:40.930> allowed<00:05:41.349> to<00:05:41.800> do<00:05:42.099> that<00:05:42.310> I

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
he's I think he's allowed to do that I

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.640 
he's I think he's allowed to do that I
don't<00:05:42.580> know<00:05:42.669> whether<00:05:42.789> he<00:05:43.000> was<00:05:43.090> joking<00:05:43.509> but<00:05:44.380> if

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
don't know whether he was joking but if

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.659 
don't know whether he was joking but if
they<00:05:44.770> really<00:05:44.949> do<00:05:45.190> have<00:05:45.310> an<00:05:45.400> open<00:05:45.639> relationship

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
they really do have an open relationship

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.520 
they really do have an open relationship
then<00:05:46.360> what<00:05:46.449> that<00:05:46.479> means<00:05:46.810> is<00:05:46.960> they<00:05:47.080> can<00:05:47.110> just<00:05:47.410> go

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
then what that means is they can just go

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.350 
then what that means is they can just go
off<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:47.770> fuck<00:05:48.280> whoever<00:05:48.490> they<00:05:48.759> want<00:05:49.000> but<00:05:49.240> then

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
off and fuck whoever they want but then

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.939 
off and fuck whoever they want but then
they'll<00:05:49.539> still<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.780> an<00:05:50.080> item<00:05:50.470> or<00:05:50.650> something

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
they'll still be an item or something

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.249 
they'll still be an item or something
along<00:05:51.310> those<00:05:51.520> lines<00:05:51.849> so<00:05:52.210> I<00:05:52.449> said<00:05:52.900> I<00:05:52.990> don't<00:05:53.110> know

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
along those lines so I said I don't know

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.409 
along those lines so I said I don't know
if<00:05:53.380> that's<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.650> joke<00:05:53.680> or<00:05:54.099> not<00:05:54.250> but<00:05:54.580> in<00:05:55.030> all

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
if that's a joke or not but in all

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.969 
if that's a joke or not but in all
fairness<00:05:55.690> Mallory<00:05:56.169> does<00:05:56.410> end<00:05:56.590> up<00:05:56.710> fucking

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.580

glad<00:05:57.370> but<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.419> thing<00:05:58.630> with<00:05:58.810> that<00:05:58.840> is<00:05:59.020> that<00:05:59.410> she

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
glad but the thing with that is that she

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.110 
glad but the thing with that is that she
does<00:05:59.800> that<00:06:00.009> because<00:06:00.190> she<00:06:00.550> wants<00:06:00.789> Vlad<00:06:00.970> to

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
does that because she wants Vlad to

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920 
does that because she wants Vlad to
leave<00:06:01.240> him<00:06:01.449> alone

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
leave him alone

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.960 
leave him alone
so<00:06:02.250> actually<00:06:03.250> her<00:06:03.340> heart<00:06:03.610> was<00:06:03.759> in<00:06:03.789> the<00:06:03.880> right

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
so actually her heart was in the right

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.510 
so actually her heart was in the right
place<00:06:04.360> in<00:06:04.659> that<00:06:04.780> sense<00:06:05.139> so<00:06:05.500> I'm<00:06:06.159> not<00:06:06.310> really

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
place in that sense so I'm not really

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.310 
place in that sense so I'm not really
sure<00:06:06.639> in<00:06:06.970> that<00:06:07.090> regard<00:06:07.449> but<00:06:07.599> I'd<00:06:07.720> say<00:06:07.900> you

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
sure in that regard but I'd say you

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.689 
sure in that regard but I'd say you
probably<00:06:08.620> something<00:06:08.979> up<00:06:09.070> yourself<00:06:09.490> pretty

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:09.699 
probably something up yourself pretty

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:10.830 
probably something up yourself pretty
well<00:06:09.789> I<00:06:09.940> think<00:06:10.210> it's<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.389> mixture<00:06:10.630> of<00:06:10.750> the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
well I think it's a mixture of the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.370 
well I think it's a mixture of the
commitment<00:06:11.349> issues<00:06:11.740> and<00:06:12.539> also<00:06:13.539> what<00:06:14.139> was<00:06:14.259> the

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
commitment issues and also what was the

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.020 
commitment issues and also what was the
other<00:06:14.470> thing<00:06:14.800> just<00:06:15.159> taking<00:06:15.729> their<00:06:15.880> for

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
other thing just taking their for

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.749 
other thing just taking their for
granted<00:06:16.539> so<00:06:16.840> anyway<00:06:17.710> that's<00:06:17.979> the<00:06:18.130> game<00:06:18.310> dawn<00:06:18.550> I
