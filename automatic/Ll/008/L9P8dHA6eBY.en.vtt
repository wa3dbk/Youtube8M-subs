00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
add a really good but I'm just a

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.529 
add a really good but I'm just a
disappointment<00:05:13.879> for<00:05:13.969> me<00:05:14.030> that<00:05:14.270> they're<00:05:14.419> not

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
disappointment for me that they're not

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.939 
disappointment for me that they're not
available<00:05:14.689> on<00:05:15.610> any<00:05:16.689> device<00:05:17.689> with<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.139> iOS

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
available on any device with the iOS

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.679 
available on any device with the iOS
less<00:05:19.279> than<00:05:19.460> four<00:05:19.699> point<00:05:19.909> two<00:05:20.029> point<00:05:20.240> eight<00:05:20.389> I

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
less than four point two point eight I

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.390 
less than four point two point eight I
hope<00:05:20.990> there's<00:05:21.199> an<00:05:21.289> update<00:05:21.439> that<00:05:21.650> allows<00:05:22.159> it<00:05:22.370> to

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
hope there's an update that allows it to

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.390 
hope there's an update that allows it to
become<00:05:22.699> more<00:05:22.849> available<00:05:22.969> and<00:05:23.629> also<00:05:24.439> the<00:05:25.129> cost

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
become more available and also the cost

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.709 
become more available and also the cost
is<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:26.259> guess<00:05:27.259> pretty<00:05:27.560> decently<00:05:28.039> priced<00:05:28.719> 999

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
is I guess pretty decently priced 999

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.839 
is I guess pretty decently priced 999
some<00:05:30.590> people<00:05:30.830> might<00:05:30.949> be<00:05:31.189> that<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.430> a<00:05:31.460> law<00:05:31.699> but

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
some people might be that is a law but

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.839 
some people might be that is a law but
this<00:05:34.849> is<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.779> pretty<00:05:36.169> much<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:37.310> answer<00:05:37.699> the

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
this is a pretty much the answer the

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.450 
this is a pretty much the answer the
power<00:05:38.090> point<00:05:38.449> of<00:05:39.139> course<00:05:39.439> we<00:05:39.650> all<00:05:39.770> saw<00:05:40.009> my<00:05:40.039> best

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
power point of course we all saw my best

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.019 
power point of course we all saw my best
microsoft<00:05:41.270> office<00:05:41.719> app<00:05:42.460> that<00:05:43.460> i'll<00:05:43.729> put<00:05:43.909> an

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
microsoft office app that i'll put an

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
annotation for it but i talked about

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.730 
annotation for it but i talked about
documents<00:05:49.310> to<00:05:49.400> go<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.939> this<00:05:50.509> is<00:05:50.719> like<00:05:51.020> 10

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
documents to go and this is like 10

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.089 
documents to go and this is like 10
times<00:05:52.009> better<00:05:52.279> than<00:05:52.460> that<00:05:52.990> sadly<00:05:53.990> like<00:05:54.680> i<00:05:54.830> said

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
times better than that sadly like i said

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.700 
times better than that sadly like i said
the<00:05:55.340> one<00:05:55.520> downside<00:05:56.000> it<00:05:56.389> doesn't<00:05:56.719> really<00:05:56.840> is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
the one downside it doesn't really is

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.760 
the one downside it doesn't really is
only<00:05:58.310> compatible<00:05:58.550> with<00:05:59.300> most<00:05:59.629> devices<00:06:00.319> except

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
only compatible with most devices except

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
for the newer ones and that's a big

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.170 
for the newer ones and that's a big
disappointment<00:06:03.250> but<00:06:04.250> it's<00:06:04.520> cool<00:06:04.819> that<00:06:04.849> they
