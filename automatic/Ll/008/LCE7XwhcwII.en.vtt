00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:14.499
 a dividing wall completely changes the goodbye of your basements creates new 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.509
 rooms and also a more comfortable space where to live a frame well 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.789
 built is the key it's pretty easy to do it with the tools 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.190
 appropriate road 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.040
 basic knowledge the first step is to determine the length 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.759
 of the couple that wants to build 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.760
 nor the distance from the wall there are 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.350
 and with a string 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.190
 mark a straight line on the floor 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.960
 You must place the bottom sole of the new pair along the line of 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.290
 chalk 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.830
 I put two-by-four timbers for the upper and inner solitude of the 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.480
 TV appearance to large plumbing parties should use more 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 quick of all for six 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.030
 a the logs with a clamp to ensure that the cuts of the same 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 size 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.590
 cut the timbers according to the length of the wall 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.330
 keep us together while measuring the distance at which to locate the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.140
 stiles 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.480
 at intervals and 16 inches from the centers 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.250
 as the studs are an inch and a half thick there will be a mark 3 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.040
 quarter inch to one two sides of the center mark and with a square mark 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 the place where the amount will be removed to the solitude 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.550
 you have to determine the height of the stiles 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.350
 at intervals by the chalk line look at the distance between the floor and the ceiling 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.850
 few days 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.200
 to accurately calculate the height of the mutants give the thickness of the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.370
 superior solera 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.270
 of the distance between the floor and the ceiling 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.480
 count the number of marks in the hearth to determine how many voters pan 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.050
 needs to 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.860
 Before cutting the wood, look at the edge of the purple swag 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.120
 often the tables have a slight curve or arc which is called 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.560
 put these stiles more straight on each side 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.129
 with the crowns facing up 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.569
 place the frame on the floor 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.439
 using the marks he made in the upper hearth the interior at intervals of 16 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.149
 inches 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.879
 arrange the amounts of works 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.569
 screw 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.439
 but superior to the uprights starting with the amount of each end of the 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.559
 wall 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:30.799
 Screw the other sunshades or higher before carlos havas 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.699
 lower average 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.599
 once all the uprights there have subjected to superior deafness and 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.989
 inferior political angels what unites them 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.989
 the interior in the cleaning mark on the floor 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.040
 the level of carpenter peace to ensure that the framework that he recovers tikal 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.919
 If there is a space between the frame and the chest or the beams, place wedges for 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.319
 fill in the blanks 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.219
 use a general purpose razor to cut wedges 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.789
 to ensure that the wall remains as 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.369
 scola zorrilla to the floor and ceiling beams 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.439
 after placing the frame of his father can by stealing it with boards 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.810
 dry and continue with your basement renovation project 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.239
 so more save that is the power according to a pilot 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.819
 Here you can find a reminder list of the tools and 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.019
 materials that you will need to carry out this project
