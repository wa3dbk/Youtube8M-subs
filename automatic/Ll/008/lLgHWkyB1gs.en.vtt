00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 One thing is a beautiful one again 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.420
 Today I want you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.679
 show how to get out of these three simple ones 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.740
 a great face mask resp 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.509
 so facial exfoliation can be done 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 if you want to know how the whole 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.869
 go and how it works then 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.300
 please plan and I wish you 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.019
 Have fun for this secret baking powder 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.900
 Mixture you need baking powder once 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.599
 then once a tablespoon needed 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.910
 her back natron of it a whole blackboard 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.040
 So either a coffee cup or ever 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.559
 after the normal chance you because there 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.270
 have lie and sea ​​salt and for that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 she also needs another tablespoon 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.200
 or, as the case may be, newer again 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.850
 should be peelings 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.260
 I invite you first how to do that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 All me and I will be the same 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.140
 again for you there so i have here 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.550
 now a cup back soda in my 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 Now I only have half a cup 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.850
 bagdad space taken because my cup 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.640
 is quite big 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.420
 I would recommend you a normal 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.830
 coffee mug to take this 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.790
 I should explain this to commercial users 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 which one of the grandma's kitchen knows exactly 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.470
 I would rather recommend that because 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 otherwise that would be too much 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 then I pack here once so 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.850
 baking powder and once more salt so that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.680
 what we do is that we have this bug 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170
 Simply go into a natron 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.470
 bowl 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:35.220
 then we give a tablespoon of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:39.479
 baking powder added to it and one 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:46.759
 tablespoons of sea salt or just normal 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.990
 salt so that helped again 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.630
 and all for me then me 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.670
 tidy and are then thus 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.840
 Goes that way because we all this here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.920
 mixed together 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.600
 So I have everyone now 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.220
 took 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 is it that I complete myself that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.729
 It is easy for you to use it all 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.830
 a bike that means you can do that in 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.960
 give a lok and lure can or in 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.970
 any dose where her then 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.039
 want to keep and it excites you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.319
 then each time takes away from the side 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.150
 Mix a spoon so one 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.330
 teaspoon and then there in such a 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.650
 bowl and then either give it to you 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.380
 or two 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.140

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.250
 water and then add it to the mixture 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.819
 and then you get the band after you 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.769
 mixed bit has such a mass so 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.030

 not neutral so it's really free 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.580
 everything from make up and everything 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.700

 not with warm water but with 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.239
 cold so the salt could not 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.790

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.709
