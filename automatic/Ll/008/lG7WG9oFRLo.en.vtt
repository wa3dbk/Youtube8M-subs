00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.600
 vision is a complicated process 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.740
 which requires the joint operation of several segments of the eyes and the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.909
 brain 

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:12.339
 as we look around us, the rays of light collide and bounce off objects 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.989
 around us 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.249
 the rays of light that travel normally straight line 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.409
 it then penetrates the eye and deviates when passing through the corneous protrusion 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.399
 this designation process is called refraction 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.359
 after refraction the colorful iris and the small black pupil 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.349
 Reverse the light 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.980
 the iris muscles are constantly adjusting the amount of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 light to which the pupil is exposed 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.270
 the light that passes through the pupil will continue its way through the lens of the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 eye very similar to the lenses of a camera 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.320
 the lenses of the eye further deflect the lucila invest 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.020
 the lenses focus the light of the object at the bottom of the eye on a layer of nerves 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.320
 that forms the retina 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.890
 it takes the light and that informs an inverted image and down 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.000
 The retina is formed of light-sensitive cells called canes icons 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.130
 the number of canes is greater than that of two and its primary function is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.260
 help us see in low light 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.060
 the settlers contain robak sinha 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.870
 this is the substance responsible for the colors and details that we see 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.630
 the retina transforms the image into electrical impulses that travel to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 through the optic nerves and on which it assumes or tico 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.100
 which is more has the form of x 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.560
 and allows the impulses to travel to the opposite side of the brain in the extinct 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.840
 optical screws 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.730
 Both slings will carry the impulses of both left and right eyes of your 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.090
 different visual perspective to the thalamus 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.390
 in the thalamus the impulses will meet with nerves that the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.340
 will transport the visual cortex of the brain 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.780
 the visual perspectives of the right and left eye come together creating a 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 Image with clear and three-dimensional shape
