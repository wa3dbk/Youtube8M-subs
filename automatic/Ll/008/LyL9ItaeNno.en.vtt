of garter stitch fabric to get a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.240 
of garter stitch fabric to get a

Metro<00:00:10.349> stitch<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:11.250> because<00:00:11.550> we're<00:00:11.700> working

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
Metro stitch but because we're working

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490 
Metro stitch but because we're working
with<00:00:12.000> garter<00:00:12.330> stitch<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.139> bit<00:00:13.259> different

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
with garter stitch it's a bit different

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.289 
with garter stitch it's a bit different
as<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> fabric<00:00:14.370> has<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> different<00:00:14.969> width<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
as the fabric has a different width to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.599 
as the fabric has a different width to

because<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.840> had<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> sugars<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.470> an<00:00:22.529> iPod<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
because I had the sugars on an iPod and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.150 
because I had the sugars on an iPod and
the<00:00:23.310> resolution<00:00:23.820> could<00:00:24.060> be<00:00:24.240> better<00:00:25.160> there's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the resolution could be better there's

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
the resolution could be better there's
two<00:00:26.430> ways<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.420> first<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.080> via

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
two ways to do this the first is via

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
two ways to do this the first is via
smiles<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> new<00:00:29.429> shapes<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> edge

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
smiles or the new shapes at the edge

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.319 
smiles or the new shapes at the edge
which<00:00:30.810> makes<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> less<00:00:31.439> bulky<00:00:31.650> scene<00:00:32.329> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
which makes for a less bulky scene the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.910 
which makes for a less bulky scene the
second<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> high<00:00:34.110> enough<00:00:34.290> rounds<00:00:34.590> or

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
second is high enough rounds or

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.069 
second is high enough rounds or
upside-down<00:00:35.280> new<00:00:35.700> shapes<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.660> makes<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
upside-down new shapes which makes the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
upside-down new shapes which makes the
seem<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> bit<00:00:37.500> more<00:00:37.530> bulky<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.370> leaves<00:00:38.579> less

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
seem a bit more bulky but leaves less

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
seem a bit more bulky but leaves less
chance<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.300> any<00:00:39.570> loose<00:00:39.780> edge<00:00:39.989> stitches<00:00:40.559> might

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
chance of any loose edge stitches might

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.940 
chance of any loose edge stitches might
make<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> mole<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.460> finished<00:00:41.790> project

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
make a mole in your finished project

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.709 
make a mole in your finished project
first<00:00:43.950> I'm<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.700> show<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:44.969> how<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.329> seam

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
first I'm going to show you how to seam

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
first I'm going to show you how to seam
via<00:00:46.079> outermost<00:00:46.800> smiles<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> edge<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> a

via outermost smiles with the edge of a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
via outermost smiles with the edge of a
project<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:49.379> showing<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.890> technique<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
project I'm showing this technique on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.610 
project I'm showing this technique on
two<00:00:50.760> swatches<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.660> blue<00:00:51.899> yarn<00:00:52.170> using

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
two swatches I did with blue yarn using

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
two swatches I did with blue yarn using
a<00:00:52.800> contrasting<00:00:53.160> yellow<00:00:53.550> thread<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
a contrasting yellow thread for the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.229 
a contrasting yellow thread for the
actual<00:00:54.600> seam<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.340> start<00:00:56.340> by<00:00:56.550> entering<00:00:56.760> your

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
actual seam in start by entering your

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
actual seam in start by entering your
working<00:00:57.480> yarn<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.350> attached<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> both

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
working yarn so it's attached to both

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.599 
working yarn so it's attached to both
pieces<00:00:59.399> I<00:01:00.230> did<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.680> treading<00:01:02.129> my<00:01:02.250> working

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
pieces I did this by treading my working

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.490 
pieces I did this by treading my working
yarn<00:01:02.640> through<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> first<00:01:03.239> smile<00:01:03.870> shape<00:01:04.140> from

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
yarn through the first smile shape from

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.950 
yarn through the first smile shape from
the<00:01:04.589> bottom<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> top

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.380 

next<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:15.620> under<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.160> next<00:01:16.430> entire<00:01:16.940> stitch

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
next you so under the next entire stitch

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.660 
next you so under the next entire stitch
up<00:01:17.690> from<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> hole<00:01:18.350> where<00:01:18.650> your<00:01:18.770> yarn<00:01:19.070> exited

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
up from the hole where your yarn exited

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:28.000 
up from the hole where your yarn exited
on<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.880> right<00:01:20.180> side

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.980 

and<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.730> pick<00:01:28.910> up<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.120> next<00:01:29.390> smell<00:01:29.690> shape

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and you pick up the next smell shape

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.410 
and you pick up the next smell shape
bottom<00:01:30.620> to<00:01:30.740> top<00:01:30.920> followed<00:01:31.700> by<00:01:31.880> picking<00:01:32.270> up<00:01:32.360> the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
bottom to top followed by picking up the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.150 
bottom to top followed by picking up the
next<00:01:32.750> stitch<00:01:33.050> from<00:01:33.320> where<00:01:33.500> your<00:01:33.650> working<00:01:33.890> yarn

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
next stitch from where your working yarn

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.540 
next stitch from where your working yarn
is<00:01:34.370> exiting<00:01:34.820> on<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> vertical<00:01:35.480> piece

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.610 

just<00:01:39.550> keep<00:01:39.760> going<00:01:40.030> like<00:01:40.060> this<00:01:40.350> smile<00:01:41.350> the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
just keep going like this smile the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.220 
just keep going like this smile the
stitch<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.280> smile<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.760> stitch<00:01:43.030> making<00:01:43.900> sure

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
stitch and smile the stitch making sure

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.990 
stitch and smile the stitch making sure
to<00:01:44.410> always<00:01:44.560> vent<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> right<00:01:45.430> side<00:01:45.730> where

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
to always vent on the right side where

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.950 
to always vent on the right side where
you<00:01:46.120> exited<00:01:46.540> before<00:01:46.990> picking<00:01:47.230> up<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.590> smiles

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you exited before picking up the smiles

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.690 
you exited before picking up the smiles
as<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.350> see<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.890> looks<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.220> bit<00:01:51.250> weird<00:01:51.580> at

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
as you can see it looks a bit weird at

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.850 
as you can see it looks a bit weird at
first<00:01:51.730> but<00:01:52.330> after<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:52.900> while<00:01:53.080> you<00:01:53.380> get<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.620> same

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
first but after a while you get the same

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.620 
first but after a while you get the same
pattern<00:01:54.250> as<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.430> mutant<00:01:54.850> at<00:01:54.970> your<00:01:55.120> work<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.510> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
pattern as a mutant at your work to the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.580 
pattern as a mutant at your work to the
edge<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.870> your<00:01:56.080> order<00:01:56.260> peace

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.560 

just<00:02:00.590> keep<00:02:00.799> going<00:02:01.070> until<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.460> reach<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.820> up<00:02:01.939> if

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
just keep going until you reach it up if

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.630 
just keep going until you reach it up if
you<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.470> same<00:02:03.680> amount<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.009> smiles<00:02:04.369> as

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
you have the same amount of smiles as

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520 
you have the same amount of smiles as
you<00:02:04.759> have<00:02:04.850> cast<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.299> stitches<00:02:05.750> meaning<00:02:06.380> you've

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
you have cast of stitches meaning you've

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.199 
you have cast of stitches meaning you've
knit<00:02:06.710> double<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.189> rows<00:02:07.369> as<00:02:07.610> your<00:02:07.790> cast<00:02:08.030> of

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
knit double the rows as your cast of

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.779 
knit double the rows as your cast of
edge<00:02:08.390> has<00:02:08.599> stitches<00:02:08.899> itself<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:10.220> two<00:02:10.399> pieces

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
edge has stitches itself the two pieces

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.040 
edge has stitches itself the two pieces
of<00:02:10.819> fabric<00:02:11.090> line<00:02:11.480> up

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.440 

now<00:02:14.740> as<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.610> I've<00:02:15.820> been<00:02:16.180> doing<00:02:16.360> this

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
now as you can see I've been doing this

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
now as you can see I've been doing this
quite<00:02:16.660> loosely<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.350> my<00:02:17.740> working<00:02:18.070> yarn<00:02:18.100> is

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
quite loosely and my working yarn is

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.180 
quite loosely and my working yarn is
very<00:02:18.610> visible<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:20.020> fix<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.440> I'm<00:02:20.710> going<00:02:21.040> back

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
very visible to fix this I'm going back

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.830 
very visible to fix this I'm going back
with<00:02:21.370> my<00:02:21.490> needle<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.210> tightening<00:02:22.690> up

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
with my needle and just tightening up

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.480 
with my needle and just tightening up
those<00:02:23.020> yellow<00:02:23.260> stitches<00:02:23.740> by<00:02:23.980> pulling<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
those yellow stitches by pulling on the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.580 
those yellow stitches by pulling on the
loops<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.030> my<00:02:25.270> two<00:02:25.330> pieces<00:02:25.600> stays<00:02:26.110> snugly

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
loops so my two pieces stays snugly

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:43.130 
loops so my two pieces stays snugly
together

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.140 

this<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.800> how<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.010> looks<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.490> front<00:02:44.520> with

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
this is how it looks from the front with

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.180 
this is how it looks from the front with
both<00:02:45.360> stitch<00:02:45.690> directions<00:02:46.260> forming<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.740> nice<00:02:46.860> T

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
both stitch directions forming a nice T

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.670 
both stitch directions forming a nice T
shape<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.850> at<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> back<00:02:48.930> we<00:02:48.990> have<00:02:49.320> our<00:02:49.410> cast

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
shape and at the back we have our cast

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.560 
shape and at the back we have our cast
off<00:02:49.860> edge<00:02:50.040> showing<00:02:50.550> where<00:02:50.850> we<00:02:51.000> seem<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.390> two

off edge showing where we seem the two

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:01.360 
off edge showing where we seem the two
pieces<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.080> get

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.699 

but<00:03:01.519> seemingly<00:03:02.000> by<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.390> outermost<00:03:02.840> rounds<00:03:03.470> or

again<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:08.000> want<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.299> anchor<00:03:08.450> your<00:03:08.780> yarn<00:03:09.099> this

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
again you want to anchor your yarn this

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.979 
again you want to anchor your yarn this
time<00:03:10.400> instead<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.090> going<00:03:11.299> into<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.719> outermost

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
it again from the bottom to the top then

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.069 
it again from the bottom to the top then
you<00:03:18.739> enter<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.189> bound-off<00:03:19.609> stitch<00:03:19.969> from<00:03:20.810> our

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
exiting point to the right just the same

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.289

taking care not to rip your working yarn
out<00:03:28.579> of<00:03:28.700> your<00:03:28.819> tips<00:03:29.030> turn<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:29.420> like<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.930> did

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.009 

enter<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.430> next<00:03:44.700> round<00:03:44.939> of<00:03:45.090> stitch<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.689> just

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
enter the next round of stitch and just

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.750 
enter the next round of stitch and just
keep<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.530> established<00:03:47.220> pattern<00:03:47.400> of

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
keep going the established pattern of

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.110 
keep going the established pattern of
brown<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.450> stitch

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
brown to stitch

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.089 
brown to stitch
just<00:03:50.959> like<00:03:51.140> in<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.319> first<00:03:51.560> part<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.860> video

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
just like in the first part of video

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.830 
just like in the first part of video
you'll<00:03:52.640> see<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:52.879> pretty<00:03:53.239> soon<00:03:53.480> your

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
you'll see that pretty soon your

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.600 
you'll see that pretty soon your
stitching<00:03:54.379> starts<00:03:54.830> to<00:03:54.950> look<00:03:55.069> like<00:03:55.099> a<00:03:55.280> row<00:03:55.489> of

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
stitching starts to look like a row of

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:15.630 
stitching starts to look like a row of
knitting<00:03:55.819> just<00:03:57.670> keep<00:03:58.670> going<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.090> top

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.300 

again<00:04:16.239> if<00:04:16.450> your<00:04:16.959> stitches<00:04:17.380> are<00:04:17.590> too<00:04:17.829> loose<00:04:18.010> you

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
again if your stitches are too loose you

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:42.750 
again if your stitches are too loose you
can<00:04:18.400> tighten<00:04:18.820> them<00:04:18.970> up<00:04:19.060> with<00:04:19.299> your<00:04:19.480> needle

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.790 

when<00:04:43.240> you're<00:04:43.450> done<00:04:43.600> you<00:04:43.960> end<00:04:44.140> up<00:04:44.290> again<00:04:44.500> with<00:04:44.770> a

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
when you're done you end up again with a

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.350 
when you're done you end up again with a
t-shape<00:04:45.280> at<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.580> front<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.060> a<00:04:46.180> more

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
t-shape at the front and a more

pronounced<00:04:46.870> seam<00:04:47.140> at<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.500> back

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.730 

I<00:04:55.220> hope<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.240> video<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.660> helpful<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:57.260> thanks
