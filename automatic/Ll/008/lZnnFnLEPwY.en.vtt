much<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:07.640> as<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.090> say<00:01:08.300> having<00:01:08.630> said<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:08.840> quite

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
much but as I say having said that quite

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.570 
much but as I say having said that quite
a<00:01:09.230> few<00:01:09.470> years<00:01:09.650> ago<00:01:09.740> four<00:01:10.070> or<00:01:10.160> five<00:01:10.310> years<00:01:10.520> ago

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
a few years ago four or five years ago

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980 
a few years ago four or five years ago
this<00:01:10.850> might<00:01:11.060> have<00:01:11.150> been<00:01:11.270> more<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.510> a<00:01:11.630> top-end

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
this might have been more of a top-end

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.770 
this might have been more of a top-end
see<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:13.100> reason<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.400> say<00:01:13.520> that<00:01:13.630> it's<00:01:14.630> because

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
see the reason I say that it's because

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.390 
see the reason I say that it's because
unlike<00:01:15.350> other<00:01:15.530> suits<00:01:15.830> around<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.250> store

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
unlike other suits around the store

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.220 
unlike other suits around the store
price<00:01:16.670> range<00:01:16.940> is<00:01:17.240> still<00:01:17.420> comprised<00:01:18.020> of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
price range is still comprised of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.170 
price range is still comprised of
superstretch<00:01:18.710> neoprene<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.460> normal

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
superstretch neoprene and normal

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.270 
superstretch neoprene and normal
neoprene<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.170> as<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.650> respect<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:22.190> the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
neoprene so as you respect it in the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.000 
neoprene so as you respect it in the
lower<00:01:22.460> body<00:01:22.670> on<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.420> 5<00:01:23.630> mil<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.410> say<00:01:24.590> 5<00:01:24.800> mil

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
lower body on the 5 mil and I say 5 mil

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.620 
lower body on the 5 mil and I say 5 mil
that's<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.310> thickness<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.940> neoprene<00:01:26.270> so

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's the thickness of the neoprene so

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480 
that's the thickness of the neoprene so
5<00:01:26.930> millimeters<00:01:27.500> thick<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.980> core<00:01:28.220> on<00:01:28.460> the

5 millimeters thick on the core on the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.790 
5 millimeters thick on the core on the
body<00:01:28.730> where<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.000> need<00:01:29.120> a<00:01:29.150> bit<00:01:29.300> more<00:01:29.450> warmth<00:01:29.800> 5

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
minute neoprene on the lower body and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.540 
minute neoprene on the lower body and
that<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.630> cheaper<00:01:33.110> lower<00:01:33.890> grade<00:01:34.130> neoprene

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
that is the cheaper lower grade neoprene

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.860 
that is the cheaper lower grade neoprene
but<00:01:34.820> having<00:01:35.000> said<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.150> still<00:01:35.540> looking<00:01:35.720> back

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
but having said that still looking back

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.720 
but having said that still looking back

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
reflects still fairly soft compared to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.490

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
supermarkets that cursed off okay but as

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.020 
supermarkets that cursed off okay but as
you<00:01:45.830> move<00:01:45.950> further<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.370> suit<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:46.790> under

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
you move further up the suit so under

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.520 
you move further up the suit so under
the<00:01:47.120> arms<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.360> over<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.630> arms<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:48.290> get<00:01:48.440> the

really stretchy neoprene so that's got a

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.450 
really stretchy neoprene so that's got a
really<00:01:51.020> good<00:01:51.260> flex<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.070> near

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
it feel really nice around the neck so

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.680 
it feel really nice around the neck so
less<00:02:54.440> self<00:02:54.680> restricted<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.340> choking<00:02:55.819> that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
less self restricted and choking that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.319 
less self restricted and choking that

sort of an looser sort of design should

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.789 
sort of an looser sort of design should
feel<00:02:59.540> good<00:02:59.720> at<00:02:59.840> around<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.170> neck<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.380> so

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
feel good at around the neck and so

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.710 
feel good at around the neck and so
