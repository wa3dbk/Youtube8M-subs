00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:13.290
 we're back in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.000
 i dont know i believe if now 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 somebody knows we could and the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.730
 again on the award and possible 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.990
 we will not forget ours 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 to draw more often in the last few months 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.970
 but also where we are right now 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.330
 stand and therefore we say till 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.760
 labeled something 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.090
 to the blog or a voucher code for 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.500
 our character so if you know where 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.630
 that is the right one among all 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.239
 We will give this construction code 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.230
 for a coach from the whole of this 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.370
 shop we will be giving away the cattle market and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.920
 when we finally know again 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.970
 where we are we can actually go 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.860
 place we have here again as nice 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.309
 Construction are the last time already 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.140
 rather 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.120
 this was with the cloth or in 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.100
 The color race you are looking for does not know what 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.790
 you have this time like it 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.920
 We have come to this conclusion 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.570
 We had the jubilation recently 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 with a huge success globally 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.490
 especially in the usa is very very good 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.860
 works right from the start 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.900
 and for us this is an absolute 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.390
 highlight the focused too for that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.380
 this year for 20 15 and 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.040
 Of course, ours want that 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.780
 facilitate contribution of castration and 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.200
 have accordingly the configurator 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.130
 set up so that now the jubilarian 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.680
 can build 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.650
 what more options do you have 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.060
 in principle from the first four the 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.399
 possibility to the classic runner 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.110
 to take with classic banner and 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.860
 content to change 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.680
 the inline variants of course bribe 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.590
 through the very concise white tooling 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.380
 We will be in the configurator now too 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.920
 additionally offer colored schools like 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 also babbel tutu left hand traffic made to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.170
 left or on begging left the 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.570
 dual accordingly can then use around 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.019
 the eventual the completely black 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.840
 tuner to build the band just as well 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.180
 friesoythe with the cover flow 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.269
 is very well received and very good 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.390
 works and just fits the type 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:22.510
 Of course you can do that accordingly 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.980
 but classical kate nash also has the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.420
 possibility and that's not even the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.010
 final leather this is the final one 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.130
 of course, have the possibility with synonymous 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.260
 to play the leather and there it was 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.130
 Also important that we are the silhouette of 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.380
 absolutely tribute to tribute and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.480
 Accordingly, also very best leather 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.070
 offer for consumers you have now 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.700
 here very structured accordingly 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.890
 the leather 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.799
 but you see then stop accordingly 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.450
 also a very soft leather and then 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.489
 accordingly we have colors 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.120
 additionally a reflex carmo in it 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.420
 which reflects very very strongly and 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.250
 then hold a few special special 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.250
 materials like here for example 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.080
 huge yes that exactly neopren but 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.960
 then, of course , classic execution 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.520
 How can I optionally just on the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.920
 shoe on top 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.140
 and then probably in contrast 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.710
 this on for cage and consider what 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.980
 namely because no contrasts can set 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.580
 how the sun choose what tooling and 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.910
 then have my own waldmÃ¼ller whole 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.560
 exactly 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.880
 but there is that it is the same 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.680
 variant or that I am the same 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.940
 variant now as accordingly 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.200
 first will be available 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.250
 you see her here the dull black 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.720
 unit where we from my view 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.040
 probably makes the most sense in 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.250
 the present time if you have such a 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.660
 tram looks and yes and then can 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.540
 of course, it's like a split 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.190
 make or you just go to complete 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.490
 as close as you have it 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.990
 I would like to have a kasper session 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.150
 just has to please you that 's it 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.760
 and then we have just the later 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.600
 time the possibility of this topic 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.870
 to become 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.360
 this whole native inspired direction 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.000
 we find 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.750
 very interesting for a long time and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.890
 We have also recently the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.079
 Launched with very positive feedback 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.489
 there was accordingly accordingly this 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.440
 Mr. is execution 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.850
 we have said they want the idea of 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.460
 shoe 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.900
 to rewrite new material on new material 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.540
 graphic story and have accordingly 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.480
 Now here these are the federal advisers 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.970
 The pattern also comes to mind 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.530
 So you have to socal aces and 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.190
 you have accordingly also the 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.140
 but classic boxing is on the wheel 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.820
 as you can see here now 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.820
 accordingly another execution 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.130
 always the same pattern or only 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.850
 different in color and exactly there is it 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.760
 once in a gray tone exactly in that 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.070
 Catholic black and red in this 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.150
 I would say traditional 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.170
 categories if those of the tribe though 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.770
 say that the traditional Catholic 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.330
 the headquarters then there is the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.440
 personalization and now sometimes 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.880
 correct at customization the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.860
 Personalization is planned 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.690
 provided on the strip of the above 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.130
 tongue are also very much at stake 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.660
 High quality leather material is here 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.880
 still written in small that will be 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.130
 stop in the final version it will be 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:33.470
 holder captain letters so micro 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:35.780
 socially these marvel and stories 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.280
 that must be really good believe me 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.220
 I'm not such a fan of this one 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:45.350
 history i know that means if basel 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.830
 clearly it could therefore now on the hype 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.580
 williams video what they cared so much 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.540
 smoke still somewhere else that 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.740
 pull through nicely 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.790
 so what I think this is something 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.320
 else but what i made of mine 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.320
 Feel out and not intrusive 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.560
 association as well as interpret it stop 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.220
 also quite basically as an extension 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.590
 range because we have just in line the 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.990
 very clear design language that it stops 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.550
 a white tooling is that we do this 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.780
 tool I now in the street 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.570
 want to bring that it just for it 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.710
 known is this silhouette and we 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.930
 extend it in the concept 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.470
 we'll just give you extra options for 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:32.660
 the consumer says ok already 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:38.270
 I would like so that is already april 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:40.680
 basically the masterpiece Burana 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.500
 the several variations with the 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.820
 different materials and 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.920
 These are then possible in color 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.370
 want to design that and then 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.360
 from may comes exactly then story and the 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.580
 There's also to win 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.990
 you can win that part if 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.210
 we tell each other where we are we have 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.310
 somehow forgot a lot of skin 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.230
 just get out of the climate for the movie yet 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.400
 time has taken nice that we 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.810
 always make it in the same way 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.890
 clothes in front of the cameras 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.700
 that is we have to be in the future 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.710
 maybe a little better 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:11.010
 but vote or if nothing 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.680
 That's why we wear it three times 

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:18.360
 that 's classic then make you one 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.960
 nice day thank you go on and then 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.960
 is good
