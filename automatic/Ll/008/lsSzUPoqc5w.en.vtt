00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
mean you end up having to do it because

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980 
mean you end up having to do it because

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
of these games where you shoot some

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.550 
of these games where you shoot some
innocent<00:01:31.439> animal<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.130> carve<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.560> don't

it<00:01:37.049> seems<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.380> bit<00:01:37.470> tedious<00:01:38.360> anyway<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it seems a bit tedious anyway that the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
it seems a bit tedious anyway that the
weapons<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.170> looking<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.710> cool<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> gameplay

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

is looking cool the environments are
looking<00:01:44.189> cool<00:01:44.479> I'm<00:01:45.479> sure<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.380> game<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
looking cool I'm sure that this game is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.679 
looking cool I'm sure that this game is
going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.340> everything<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.299> hoped<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
going to be everything that we hoped it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.260 
going to be everything that we hoped it
was<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.149> they

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
was going to be and I think that they

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
was going to be and I think that they
have<00:01:51.299> improved<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.990> lot<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> things<00:01:52.649> that

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
have improved a lot of the things that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.120 
have improved a lot of the things that
people<00:01:53.549> complained<00:01:53.909> about<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.390> far<00:01:54.689> cry<00:01:54.930> 2

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
people complained about in far cry 2

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.350 
people complained about in far cry 2
particularly<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> an

particularly with you know go to an

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.440 
particularly with you know go to an
encampment<00:01:57.979> clearing<00:01:58.979> everybody<00:01:59.340> else<00:01:59.579> then

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
encampment clearing everybody else then

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.179 
encampment clearing everybody else then
you<00:02:00.479> come<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.560> five<00:02:01.829> minutes

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you come back that way five minutes

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.819 
you come back that way five minutes
later<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.700> everybody's<00:02:03.450> respawn<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.619> that

doesn't seem to be a problem this time
round<00:02:06.540> I'm<00:02:06.780> sure<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> an

set<00:03:57.989> your<00:03:58.079> PlayStation<00:03:58.739> up<00:03:58.859> when<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.100> weren't

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
set your PlayStation up when you weren't

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.910 
set your PlayStation up when you weren't
playing<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.730> game<00:03:59.940> as<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.260> dedicated<00:04:01.260> server

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
playing the game as a dedicated server

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.849 
playing the game as a dedicated server
and<00:04:02.280> then<00:04:03.150> other<00:04:03.840> people<00:04:04.049> would<00:04:04.350> play<00:04:04.590> games

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
and then other people would play games

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.190 
and then other people would play games
on<00:04:05.160> your<00:04:05.220> rotation<00:04:06.120> using<00:04:06.569> your<00:04:06.600> connection

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
on your rotation using your connection

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.080 
on your rotation using your connection
so<00:04:07.319> if<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.500> had<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> good<00:04:07.859> connection<00:04:08.090> chances

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
so if you had a good connection chances

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.430 
so if you had a good connection chances
are<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.450> could<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:09.780> people<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.319> play

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
are that you could get people to play

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.930 
are that you could get people to play
your<00:04:11.069> maps<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.880> had<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.030> varied<00:04:12.500> collection

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
your maps if you had a varied collection

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.759 
your maps if you had a varied collection
in<00:04:14.940> medicals<00:04:15.510> they'd<00:04:15.630> stay<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:16.079> play<00:04:16.530> some

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
in medicals they'd stay on play some

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.920 
in medicals they'd stay on play some
other<00:04:17.459> maps<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:18.060> then<00:04:18.180> play<00:04:18.359> some<00:04:18.570> more<00:04:18.690> your

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
other maps and then play some more your

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.580 
other maps and then play some more your
map<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:19.289> that<00:04:19.320> was<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.769> really<00:04:20.220> cool<00:04:20.880> feature<00:04:21.120> I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
map so that was a really cool feature I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.320 
map so that was a really cool feature I
have<00:04:22.590> yet<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.860> really<00:04:23.190> find<00:04:23.550> out<00:04:23.760> whether<00:04:24.060> that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
have yet to really find out whether that

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.870 
have yet to really find out whether that
has<00:04:24.450> been<00:04:24.599> included<00:04:24.900> this<00:04:25.200> time<00:04:25.580> it

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
has been included this time it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.460 
has been included this time it
again<00:04:27.150> it's<00:04:27.330> what<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.510> mean<00:04:27.690> about<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
again it's what I mean about the the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.320 
again it's what I mean about the the
lack<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.710> information<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.700> is<00:04:29.820> common<00:04:30.180> oh
