 For you this video yesterday on the day of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.109
 launch should still be 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.900
 however due to my 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.720
 work is unable to reconcile and the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 launch of adele secom recording and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.690
 video editing to bring this 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 for you 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.270
 then bringing it all today bringing the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.670
 war snippets of gameplay leave the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.160
 four maps I'm going to speak and my 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.309
 first impressions there for you 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.820
 of all of them and there as people 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.520
 Playing I'll bring the analyzes 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.620
 separated map to map if you want 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.559
 so tell me there in the comments if 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.449
 Do you want a little more analysis? 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.510
 a little more thorough 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.250
 all these beauty maps then beginning 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.430
 for this map is that you are seeing the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 map studio which is a remake of the map 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.900
 file renders black pop zoom all 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.360
 repaginated 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.939
 as the name itself suggests is a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.810
 Hollywood studio was then made and 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.450
 various adaptations with the living room is 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.150
 Share dinosaur is dude I do not know 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.030
 It has a lot of ambience these a 1 stayed very 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.640
 Beautiful, I really liked that map. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.579
 It was much more beautiful. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.619
 colors much more vibrant and without counting 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.299
 which is map of the body of a then so 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 There is not much to talk about is a map. 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.729
 considerably small 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.110
 fantastic match dynamics that match 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 that you are seeing a team from this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.259
 doctor but to play for example the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.320
 on this map 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.180
 there is no better thing, it's very good 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 good, I really do not know if everyone has had 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.159
 opportunity to play black sun 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.920
 but those who did will know what 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.170
 I'm talking this one got spectacular 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 this map that part of the dinosaur I 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.110
 I thought it was great, I even stopped to stay. 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.500
 looking very good even then 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.410
 approved 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.990
 another newly released map is what 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.460
 You are now seeing the map called 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.470
 magma is the map situated there is in Japan and is 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.290
 a map that I liked a lot too 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.990
 although they it has many 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.959
 corridors many random paths 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.820
 that just running a little of those is 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.459
 how can I say of those three 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.260
 main paths that have all the map 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.970
 from cody next and usa goes right 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.970
 You go from the left you go 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.450
 and if you already have some 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.790
 underneath the sides so it ends 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.770
 making it difficult to play team 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.989
 deathmatch how is correria is a map 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.400
 very good though to play a dominate 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.550
 chan has to be with the party 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.739
 closed for you to have no surprises 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.330
 at time you're playing because 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.360
 really has many paths 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.390
 but it is always so 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.000
 four maps I like 2002 I no longer 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.760
 I do not like it so much so I ended up bringing it. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.519
 For you, the two of you first. 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.430
 most liked was the remake studio still 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.370
 speaks in this network and that this map now 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.110
 which is the very beautiful magma map with 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.560
 very strong colors too 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.540
 very cool very cool show 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.500
 ball the map is more than approved 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.840
 also so I do not have to talk about these 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.269
 two maps the next two maps that I 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.769
 I'll bring you there, I already felt a 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.200
 some difficulty 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.239
 and then the hole is below me like me 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.160
 I mentioned how this one already has many 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.100
 many runners' entrances 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.790
 You did not see the others is still very 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.820
 worse 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.370
 but this map is more than approved 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.010
 I only brought a gameplay 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.170
 yes about a couple of minutes 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.060
 the map is also not so great it is 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.630
 relatively small to consider 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.220
 an average map is but has a lot in trading 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.380
 and there is a lot of corridor 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.170
 this facilitates those who enjoy playing and 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.890
 champion and not so much the galera that 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.410
 likes to rush so much where it is 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.599
 starting from the third map this is already a 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.419
 map that I did not really like the map that 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.940
 did not attract me so much the name of the map is the 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.700
 vertigo and I hope I do not have 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.590
 already replacing the names of the maps 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.690
 because it's still news for me but I 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.550
 I think that 's right I think this map 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.580
 vertigo the other to incor 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.270
 then this map 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.840
 despite him he has a beauty is 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.660
 also very surreal so you know with the 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.590
 colors are well defined and all very well 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:56.040
 drawn the dynamics of the map is very 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.980
 very very beautiful but it did not please me 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.860
 I do not like maps that have much 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.800
 up-and-down know is stairs to walk 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.170
 here the cedece goes downstairs and 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.970
 and you see here runs there is the 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.490
 side and has the 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.990
 I think this is not cool, it's over 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.470
 losing a little there 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.390
 the main focus of the game mainly 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.900
 depending on the mode you are 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.750
 playing so I'm not in favor of 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.650
 my opinion is that the map is not so good 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.080
 like this 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.700
 and maybe you disagree with what I am 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.180
 talking would even be cool you 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.250
 people who have played 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.080
 leave the description of the video if you 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.110
 agree with my opinion or not 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.630
 unfortunately the staff there playstation 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.180
 3 and the pc will only be able to play this should 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.880
 be next month is always so out 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.090
 first for xbox and after a month is 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.820
 released and protect and problems leave 3 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.419
 a trade agreement between the 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:00.030
 and the activist then has no 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.760
 It will be this way as long as 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.430
 koff dante for the consoles of the generation can 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.650
 be that for the other consoles of the 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.840
 next generation, this changes but neither does 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.700
 Nothing confirmed anything right and sound 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:17.580
 just my opinions so this is it from there 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:21.390
 and now the last map that is the map 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.400
 encorp it's all set there in a 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.570
 amusement park 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.910
 It's with a stage and for concerts assembled 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.710
 very beautiful as you are seeing the 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.140
 things are also very strong and well 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.710
 characteristic in the reality of 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.100
 all treyarch maps to the map 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.040
 also that there is a lot of 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.140
 The curve has a lot of place for you. 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.960
 to hide run on one side run 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.520
 on the other, and as I have mentioned 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.920
 very redundant I think this does not 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.020
 favors my style of play and does not 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.300
 favors cody players which is a 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.330
 thing more taken one thing but a game 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.370
 further pulled such frantic but 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.840
 map is very pretty 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.780
 as you can see is more of the four is 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.660
 I really liked two of them which was the 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:16.310
 studio and magma and two that no longer 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.780
 I liked it so much that it is the incor and I 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.800
 I always forget the name of the maps. 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.690
 impressive 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.340
 Encore that we the Vértico 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.110
 so it's the two that I did not like the 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.590
 article incurs the two that I liked 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.570
 studio is always missing the 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.280
 Magma studio then that's it folks 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.230
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.060
 previous analysis. 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.670
 now with the flow of the week 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.490
 more videos for you, do not forget to 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:43.130
 leave the favorite fan there to help 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.110
 in disseminating the video and channel 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.360
 leave your comments you will know 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.180
 What are you thinking about this mess? 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.520
 even here to know 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.010
 Did you find the video and now in 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.220

 I want to bring a video map there 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.020
 explaining to you in detail 

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.480
 how does the new dlc maps work 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:11.020
