00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.410
 good friends from youtube that is going to 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.969
 surprise in a very simple tutorial 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.789
 let's learn how to know if our 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.980
 hard disk rates in your last 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.510
 stages 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.710
 well that nothing will teach you how 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.070
 to know 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.130
 how to detect those stages when our 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.470
 hard drive is failing well this what 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.480
 I'll do my own experience and 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.090
 that my hard drive was damaged and I was 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.699
 doing a lot of research on this topic to 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.500
 to know if it really was my record the 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.030
 that was damaged 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.809
 then finding out by navigating 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.489
 internet I met many with 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.430
 many bugs that why they did not tell me what 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.680
 I needed others who gave me 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.590
 a little more then I was finding out 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.130
 we go down to depth and you can find 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.890
 certain things and other things determine 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.580
 myself, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.570
 go 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.510
 to the control panel of our windows 7 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.860
 we can not go there as with the keys 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.580
 control 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.580
 about me 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.250
 we enter the entry tasks 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.500
 in the performance tab we will not go 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.140
 to the resource monitor 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.080
 we give you click and monitor resources in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.130
 several tabs in general cpu memory 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.230
 disk in import disk here from 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.730
 this blue square 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.260
 little blue box that says 1% more time 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.920
 this is what it seemed to me when 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.700
 is damaged appeared 100% did not appear 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.300
 all saturated without it having so many 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.630
 so many open processes to be the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.810
 100% and to start something be 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.360
 simply as a browser 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.700
 I was saturated I was hanging that 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.640
 It is one of the characteristics 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 a hard drive is not damaged stays 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.190
 hung all the time 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.819
 sometimes delay to turn on fashion 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.819
 to pay 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.379
 sometimes it does not turn on 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.549
 does not appear 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.300
 for then 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.569
 you have to go looking at all these aspects 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.340
 to know well 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.750
 a star of how it is damaged 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.700
 together 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 how do you quarter your address percent and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.100
 they do not have both files so much processes 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.100
 open 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.480
 with probable symptoms the other one is 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.909
 trying with this program in the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.819
 description of the video will leave the link 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.999
 so that the carling light is called crystal 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.950
 of info 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:07.670
 we give it right click we see it as 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.670
 administrator 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.290
 and here is very simple interface the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.420
 state of health will think it is good 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.790
 but I did not know I was at risk when 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.620
 is 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.040
 I add my uncultivated temperature 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.860
 hard disk that goes between a scale of 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.860
 stated that it is 20 to 40 degrees 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.920
 in removed on the property of 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.920
 our hard drive 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.460
 to visit here with us until 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:44.750
 the yellow or in red since it was 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.930
 in what sector on the hard drive there are times 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.360
 that can be corrected with programs like 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.370
 hd regenerator subway stop at the 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.370
 little description simply 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240
 dv 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.110
 the ch cÃ¡dix also and leave some 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.890
 programs to see if everyone can 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.890
 correct your mistakes 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.659
 we live that first 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.389
 the important thing first is to see if it is 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.720
 our hard drive that is saturated with 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.720
 others 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.980
 Here we will see how to modify resources 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.820
 but also in being good that in a 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.560
 increase that is always in 100 of 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 pose the link that there was the memory 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.840
 better in my particular case on the disk 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.820
 hard of always is empty 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.430
 not also 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.120
 and all this function to give vanity 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.120
 All very well 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:03.180
 then me me and I hope that also 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.630
 can solve their concerns until the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.630
 next
