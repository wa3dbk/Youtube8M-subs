00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.710
 We already reloaded in the trailer 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.200
 could 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.119
 then i talk about my depression 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.520
 I have a very blatant video too 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.929

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.240
 Teenie of a completely different kind 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.519
 sad side see so I can you 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.120
 say only the purchase of the what the 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.860
 dvd is worth picking the dvd was on 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.750
 End also really exhausting than that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.850
 to record entire album that 's real 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.340
 crass because you had to stop thought to 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.010
 do so because of what am I talking about 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.110
 how much do I want to give and so on 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.049
 continue and I have a lot 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 abandoned and there are many 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.440
 private stuff on this dvd and me 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.180
 think that just belongs to one 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.980
 big project like the album to that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.239
 you just have a more personal one 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.500
 show side of themselves because in the 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.750
 songs are also processed one 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.280
 more personal side of it if you 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.599
 think that's what's for me twelve 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.280

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.019
