00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.760
 [Music] 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:27.420
 The good touch to show my new idea. 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 would be an arrow and haiti 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 For those who do not have the money to make a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 right on the web 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.810
 he invents such a way here what the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:44.730
 You want to do it here than I did 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.200
 get a cd know the size of the hit 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.149
 in the case of my motorcycle a yamaha made the 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:01:02.210
 [Music] 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:01:06.119
 same thing here on the principle that 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.950
 the cd I already said and the flashing 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.009
 old will get his leds will cut 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.060
 and you'll buy you'll just have to buy 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.509
 in my opinion about what happens 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.529
 here in my case were the resistors 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.729
 Then I go out on every led that connects 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:29.069
 and parallel here being positive with a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.689
 positive and negative is the negative 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.799
 end of the serial connection because the 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.749
 working with links were going to lose 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.219
 voltage I do not know how to do right did 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.759
 countless stopped me 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:47.609
 This one is ready, I 'll go 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.130
 post some photos of how it was in possession 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.439
 of the video later in the end as well 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.560
 good coming back here in the evening as I 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.560
 I suffered a lot yesterday but I 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.579
 I managed to make many business gambiarras 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.520
 very easy to do but I suffered 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:09.390
 very smart I did not form a tortoise 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.490
 this here I had to get a lamp 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.740
 I broke the insulation lamp 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.020
 This can and does not go back to the sun. 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.120
 daniel i made a region a movie 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.510
 back and if a movie like the revolt is 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.820
 that the button to solo I put pass 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.590
 hot glue on top to hold because 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.280
 the goal did what it had that I can 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.870
 I direct a burst choked power 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.570
 put jackson who still does not think 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.320
 here also a panel of 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.800
 led I gave of the proof is well 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.960
 few leds there are three months in there 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.750
 is waiting so long because I 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.310
 I picked up his mirrored side of the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.510
 cd to be more cute looks good 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.370
 pro matina inside and there the kiss bed 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.740
 hatred resisted 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.260
 just remembering that here at the time of 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.800
 put on the bike that will sink here 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.960
 and will stay pressed against the LEDs 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.710
 that she is well off and he went with glue 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.350
 hot here there will be jimmy brown never get 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.330
 moving and just put a bike after the 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.330
 post picture of how it was working 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.630
 So folks coming back here, I'm done. 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.100
 do now night but after 20 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.980
 minutes I made another video now 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.630
 I came back, I finished because I want 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.920
 show to show the first light on the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.090
 panel here 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:41.290
 I go, it's white ac. 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.069
 only she gives white, it's white 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.650
 the bottom of the middle pane him 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:51.280
 is also a weak start the bottom 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.280
 had 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:13.440
 if such a risk runs faster because the 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.440
 and one carries equal to the normal lamp 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.690
 to blink in the same city as the 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.690
 front was much faster 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.440
 in my point of view this work was 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.370
 way cooler you see the finish 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.370
 on 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.270
 theory provided time 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.730
 this part is a young and such 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:57.540
 only covers is the part where the platinum 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:05:00.300
 take in the war that has 1 to 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.550
 shiny metal match from cd to 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.900
 stay more luminous mexico but cute 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.250
 and so became people 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:15.150
 anyone who wants to do is just follow the tutorial 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.560
 online and then pick up the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.750
 how to make 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.750
 Thank you folks, you have more chance. 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.710
 I do not want noise 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:48.919
 good room here in the middle to a good 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.819
 kick 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:58.009
 is a new project that is putting together a 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:06:02.029
 of the led arrows with the old cd I 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:05.990
 I cut and made the little box where it will fit 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:12.199
 right led and then I put in the 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:19.610
 flashes I've been here so I can show them 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:22.879
 before it's good just to show a 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:33.249
 new event a new idea a new 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:33.249
 change a new job here is tempting
