brilliant amazing graphic pushing game
for<00:00:59.190> its<00:00:59.280> time<00:00:59.460> obviously<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.930> wasn't<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
for its time obviously it wasn't on the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.969 
for its time obviously it wasn't on the
ps2<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.180> therefore<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.739> amazing

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
ps2 so that therefore it was an amazing

still<00:01:09.150> alive<00:01:09.299> today<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:11.180> because<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
still alive today and because of it

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.640 
still alive today and because of it
there<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.750> star<00:01:13.200> wars<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> force

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
graphics and physics now obviously I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
graphics and physics now obviously I
don't<00:01:39.570> give<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> shit<00:01:40.020> about<00:01:40.049> graphics<00:01:40.740> because

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
don't give a shit about graphics because

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
don't give a shit about graphics because

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
done with the xbox and gamecube but i

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
done with the xbox and gamecube but i
like<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> ps2<00:01:52.799> because<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.130> had<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> better

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
like the ps2 because it had a better

a<00:01:55.979> week<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.520> generation<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:58.710> kind<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a week this generation but it kind of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.550 
a week this generation but it kind of
pisses<00:01:59.219> me<00:01:59.460> off<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.939> i<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.390> ps2<00:02:01.020> quality

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
pisses me off when i get ps2 quality

physics<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.219> my<00:02:02.369> week<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:03.149> i<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.479> my<00:02:03.750> we

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
physics on my week and i know that my we

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.819 
physics on my week and i know that my we
can<00:02:04.229> handle<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.399> more<00:02:06.500> honestly<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.680> wii

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
can handle so much more honestly the wii

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.859 
can handle so much more honestly the wii
is<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> lot<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.640> powerful<00:02:09.149> from<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> gamecube

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
is a lot more powerful from the gamecube

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.710 
is a lot more powerful from the gamecube
but<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.280> gamecube<00:02:11.819> games<00:02:12.030> still

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
but the gamecube games still

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.200 
but the gamecube games still
Overmind<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.560> graphics<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.250> power<00:02:14.430> because

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
Overmind in graphics and power because

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.200 
Overmind in graphics and power because
developers<00:02:15.990> still<00:02:16.710> want<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.220> pump<00:02:17.580> life<00:02:17.910> in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
developers still want to pump life in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.020 
developers still want to pump life in
that<00:02:18.690> 10<00:02:19.110> year<00:02:19.350> old<00:02:19.560> system<00:02:20.160> then<00:02:20.520> no<00:02:20.820> one

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
that 10 year old system then no one

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.180 
that 10 year old system then no one
barely<00:02:21.420> gives<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.810> shit<00:02:22.020> about<00:02:22.050> anymore<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.770> mean

that<00:04:19.859> some<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.640> physics<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.450> are

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
that some of the physics on the we are

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.390 
that some of the physics on the we are
better<00:04:22.140> polished<00:04:22.800> than<00:04:22.950> they<00:04:23.070> are<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
better polished than they are on the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.300 
better polished than they are on the
xbox<00:04:23.760> 360<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.419> ps3

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
xbox 360 and the ps3

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.420 
xbox 360 and the ps3
so<00:04:26.639> why<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.880> hell<00:04:27.180> am<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.419> seen<00:04:27.750> ps2<00:04:28.740> quality

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
so why the hell am I seen ps2 quality

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.600 
so why the hell am I seen ps2 quality
physics<00:04:29.870> there<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.080> no<00:04:31.500> excuse<00:04:32.400> for<00:04:32.430> this

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
physics there is no excuse for this

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.900 
physics there is no excuse for this
there<00:04:33.389> is<00:04:33.540> no<00:04:33.870> reasoning<00:04:34.470> for<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:35.340> ps2

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
there is no reasoning for this the ps2

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.750 
there is no reasoning for this the ps2
is<00:04:36.150> basically<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.780> niche<00:04:37.110> platform<00:04:37.770> if<00:04:38.610> you

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
is basically a niche platform if you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.820 
is basically a niche platform if you
still<00:04:39.030> own<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> ps2<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.500> are<00:04:40.620> actually

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
still own a ps2 and you are actually

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.650 
still own a ps2 and you are actually
buying<00:04:41.370> stuff<00:04:41.880> like<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.240> force<00:04:42.450> unleashed

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
buying stuff like the force unleashed

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.150 
buying stuff like the force unleashed
mercenaries<00:04:43.590> two<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:45.200> shit<00:04:46.200> like<00:04:46.230> call<00:04:46.980> duty

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
mercenaries two and shit like call duty

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.620

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
honestly do not see the reason why

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.560 
honestly do not see the reason why
people<00:05:30.930> still<00:05:31.289> bother<00:05:31.770> with<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.340> ps2<00:05:32.789> I<00:05:32.970> don't

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
people still bother with the ps2 I don't

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.520 
people still bother with the ps2 I don't
see<00:05:33.720> the<00:05:33.840> reason<00:05:33.960> why<00:05:34.200> they're<00:05:34.410> still

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
see the reason why they're still

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.670 
see the reason why they're still
development<00:05:35.190> for<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:35.640> don't<00:05:36.300> see<00:05:36.630> why<00:05:37.289> it's

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
development for it I don't see why it's

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.060 
development for it I don't see why it's
still<00:05:37.890> in<00:05:38.370> wine<00:05:39.270> because<00:05:39.780> honestly<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:40.530> just

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
still in wine because honestly it's just

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.590 
still in wine because honestly it's just
killing<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.550> weak<00:05:41.669> it's<00:05:42.030> kind<00:05:42.240> of<00:05:42.330> Louise

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
killing the weak it's kind of Louise

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.630 
killing the weak it's kind of Louise
library<00:05:43.050> it's<00:05:43.289> killing<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:43.890> quality<00:05:44.280> control

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
library it's killing the quality control

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.670 
library it's killing the quality control
because<00:05:45.060> all<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.450> developers<00:05:46.080> are<00:05:46.260> doing<00:05:46.530> is

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
because all the developers are doing is

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.710 
because all the developers are doing is
that<00:05:46.950> they're<00:05:47.130> developing<00:05:47.580> shitty<00:05:47.940> ps2<00:05:48.479> games

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
that they're developing shitty ps2 games

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.750 
that they're developing shitty ps2 games
and<00:05:48.900> then<00:05:49.289> adding<00:05:49.710> motion<00:05:50.039> controls<00:05:50.430> on<00:05:50.580> them

and then adding motion controls on them

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760 
and then adding motion controls on them
and<00:05:50.880> slap<00:05:51.570> in<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.810> mom<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.229> calling<00:05:52.710> them

and slap in the mom and calling them

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.300
