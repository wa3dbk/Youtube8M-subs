I think scholars are just starting to

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.649 
I think scholars are just starting to
contemplate<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.420> new<00:01:06.630> technology

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
contemplate what all this new technology

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.580 
contemplate what all this new technology
means<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:08.060> what<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.840> voters<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.439> how

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
means for what we know as voters and how

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
means for what we know as voters and how
we<00:01:10.650> participate<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> process<00:01:11.759> it<00:01:12.420> matters

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we participate in the process it matters

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.749 
we participate in the process it matters
whether<00:01:13.320> you're<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.130> looking<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.580> one

changing what you're taking from the
debate<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.649> the<00:01:31.829> answer<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
debate and I think we know the answer is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
debate and I think we know the answer is
yes<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> themes<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.110> I'm

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
yes so that's one of the themes that I'm

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.990 
yes so that's one of the themes that I'm
really<00:01:34.649> starting<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> focus<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> particularly

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
really starting to focus on particularly

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
really starting to focus on particularly
in<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.180> meeting<00:01:36.450> politics<00:01:36.840> class<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.829> also

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
one student I'm thinking of in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.090 
one student I'm thinking of in
particular<00:01:57.600> ended<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.289> double<00:01:58.619> majoring<00:01:58.920> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

film<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> political<00:02:00.539> science<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:00.960> he's

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
film and political science because he's

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.289

in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> documentary<00:02:02.009> program<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.610> always<00:02:03.119> make

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
in the documentary program I always make

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.480 
in the documentary program I always make
the<00:02:03.420> argument<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:04.170> why<00:02:04.619> political<00:02:05.100> science<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the argument of why political science is

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.609 
the argument of why political science is
the<00:02:05.610> best<00:02:05.640> major<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.180> campus<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.930> has<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.439> many

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the best major on campus it has so many

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.890 
the best major on campus it has so many
important<00:02:08.490> links<00:02:08.880> to<00:02:09.060> all<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.570> other<00:02:09.600> real

locations<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.900> what<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.140> do<00:02:11.320> I<00:02:11.530> think<00:02:11.950> it's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
just that linchpin to global

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.990 
just that linchpin to global
competitiveness<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:15.100> understanding
