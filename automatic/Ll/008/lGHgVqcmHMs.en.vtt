remember<00:01:59.009> how<00:01:59.790> many<00:02:00.829> you<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.950> like

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
remember how many you know like

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.130 
remember how many you know like
buildings<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.180> turn<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.540> off<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.049> just

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
buildings we turn this off so it's just

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.069 
buildings we turn this off so it's just
the<00:02:04.680> audio<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.640> know<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.509> buildings<00:02:06.899> go

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the audio to know like what buildings go

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.830 
the audio to know like what buildings go
where<00:02:07.290> what<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.649> usually<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.429> once<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.509> finish

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
where what I usually do is once I finish

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.100 
where what I usually do is once I finish
making<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> set<00:02:10.590> I'll<00:02:11.099> take<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> picture<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
making the set I'll take a picture of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
making the set I'll take a picture of
like

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.980 
like
set<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.490> all<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.760> its<00:02:14.880> buildings<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.690> tells

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
set in all of its buildings this tells

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.920 
set in all of its buildings this tells
me<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.830> buildings<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.280> need<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.580> know<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:18.060> that

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
me what buildings I need to know or that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.950 
me what buildings I need to know or that
I<00:02:19.230> need<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.630> could<00:02:21.870> go

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
I need to have and you know I could go

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.620 
I need to have and you know I could go
through<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.290> check<00:02:22.410> them<00:02:22.590> off<00:02:23.090> all<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.390> tails

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
through and check them off all of tails

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.920 
through and check them off all of tails
is<00:02:24.900> are<00:02:25.290> pretty<00:02:25.950> much<00:02:26.270> either<00:02:27.270> right<00:02:27.630> next<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
is are pretty much either right next to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.480 
is are pretty much either right next to
each<00:02:28.020> other<00:02:28.170> or<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.560> inside<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:29.220> another

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
each other or like inside of one another

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.130 
each other or like inside of one another
because<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.270> big<00:02:30.450> box<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.990> then

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
because this is one big box and then

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.470 
because this is one big box and then
this<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.590> somewhere<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.270> think

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
this is somewhere and that is I think

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.310 
this is somewhere and that is I think
with<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:35.070> know<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.310> goes<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:36.000> goes<00:02:36.320> you

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
with it and you know it goes it goes you

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.280 
with it and you know it goes it goes you
know<00:02:37.440> whatever<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.750> pretty<00:02:39.930> much<00:02:40.080> how

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
know whatever so that's pretty much how

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.660 
know whatever so that's pretty much how
it<00:02:40.650> works

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it works

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.310 
it works

before<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.760> use<00:02:47.940> natural<00:02:48.180> lighting

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
before because I use natural lighting

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.300 
before because I use natural lighting
I've<00:02:48.870> never<00:02:49.110> used<00:02:49.380> any<00:02:49.590> artificial<00:02:50.130> lighting

I've never used any artificial lighting

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.940 
I've never used any artificial lighting
in<00:02:50.520> my<00:02:50.640> videos<00:02:51.320> except<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.590> scene<00:02:52.800> in

episode 10 when it's you know I'm

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.600 
episode 10 when it's you know I'm
mimicking<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.440> sonic<00:02:55.710> ova<00:02:55.950> movie<00:02:56.340> obviously

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
mimicking the sonic ova movie obviously

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.970 
mimicking the sonic ova movie obviously
that<00:02:57.450> calls<00:02:57.720> for<00:02:58.050> some<00:02:58.080> kind<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.680> lighting

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that calls for some kind of lighting

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.130 
that calls for some kind of lighting
effect<00:02:59.280> but<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> always<00:03:00.360> use<00:03:00.480> natural<00:03:00.750> lighting

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
effect but I always use natural lighting

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.870 
effect but I always use natural lighting
because<00:03:01.800> there's<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.070> spot<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.400> my<00:03:02.490> house<00:03:02.670> where

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
because there's a spot in my house where

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.130 
because there's a spot in my house where
the<00:03:02.940> natural<00:03:03.240> lighting<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:04.020> great

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
the natural lighting is just great

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.020 
the natural lighting is just great
so<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.170> recommend<00:03:07.800> doing<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.310> early<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> day

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
so I recommend doing it early in the day

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.870 
so I recommend doing it early in the day
very<00:03:09.570> early<00:03:09.750> not<00:03:10.590> too<00:03:11.220> early<00:03:11.250> because<00:03:11.700> it

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
very early not too early because it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.640 
very early not too early because it
might<00:03:12.000> show<00:03:12.210> up<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.480> little<00:03:12.600> too<00:03:12.870> orange<00:03:13.200> on

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
might show up a little too orange on

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.410 
might show up a little too orange on
your<00:03:14.450> camera<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.630> least<00:03:15.780> mine<00:03:16.080> does<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:17.420> you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
your camera at least mine does but you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
your camera at least mine does but you
know<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.690> wake<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:18.959> early<00:03:19.080> you'll<00:03:19.320> get

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
know if you wake up early you'll get

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.220 
know if you wake up early you'll get
great<00:03:19.650> natural<00:03:20.010> lighting<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.540> necroptosis

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
great natural lighting and I necroptosis

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.060 
great natural lighting and I necroptosis
I<00:03:23.070> recommend<00:03:24.290> getting<00:03:25.290> all<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.830> sets

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
I recommend getting all the sets

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.590 
I recommend getting all the sets
together<00:03:26.250> than<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.700> night<00:03:27.000> before<00:03:27.150> cuz<00:03:27.540> I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.140 
of time you know gives you a lot of
extra<00:03:57.570> time<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.620> recommend<00:03:59.459> doing<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.670> and

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
extra time so I recommend doing that and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.800 
extra time so I recommend doing that and
then<00:04:00.630> it's<00:04:00.750> pretty<00:04:00.930> much<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.220> don't<00:04:02.400> even

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
then it's pretty much and you don't even

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.780 
then it's pretty much and you don't even
have<00:04:05.600> that's<00:04:06.600> it
