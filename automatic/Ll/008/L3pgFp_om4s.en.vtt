00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Talking staff, I'm back here with more. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
 one minecraft video on the video today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.519
 to teach you how to make a generator 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.019
 of obsessed is in a very 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 known that I think everyone already 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.050
 must know how to do that is the tip generator 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 tony bulls who use fur and use water and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.210
 wash to be able to combust and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 that normal stone but today the bce had 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.359
 many people do not know and most 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.579
 What I think about youtube is the 10 and 11 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.260
 years too complicated to do and they 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.980
 complicate another business is well 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.870
 simple 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 so here I have two methods of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.710
 do this one uses tonial networks just for 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.809
 a steam network here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 press the cotton button ready then turn 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.989
 edson wedge you press the new button 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.530
 words there appears to be if you want or 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.160
 psychic 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.329
 already in that other here I use a hook and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.439
 a line of wool or presses the button that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.570
 and will also come the daily psi in making 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.159
 How do you do? 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.850
 It does not have to be this size all it's just 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:23.900
 and if that box because I wanted to 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.900
 use a little late 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.110
 so come on 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.659
 the first thing you do is open a 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.350
 hole and puts a nearby dun 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.220
 I want you to have to do it later. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 you have to do a business around 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.729
 here right in front of the water and let this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.100
 beautiful, let's do it like this, I'll go 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.409
 let the water around me to not 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.320
 end up hitting the water without ever want 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.229
 You can cover it here, we'll have to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.469
 to break that piece and put a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.210
 dispense and come here 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.729
 another stone to close like here 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.950
 Let's make it very complicated. 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.000
 I think I put a glass here so I can 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.100
 see when you have 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.290
 and when there is not going there because if you 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.440
 broke the bce while it still has lava 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 the lava will descend and will turn into 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.810
 stone can end up killing and such and such 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.760
 so I like to be leave it so 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.910
 here with glass to always know if you have 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440
 or do not wash we have a button here 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.770
 to be able to fly 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.380
 the dispenser and not even the people 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.730
 put a bucket of lava so the one here is 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.770
 that of edson's much needed 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.980
 make redstone button in the place where he 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.200
 It will touch the washing with water and you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.010
 wrong opp 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.800
 close to being you press again to 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.690
 take lava and breaks the murder 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.150
 already audi launches what you have to do 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 You have to put a stone back. 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.370
 You hooked and delayed and in front of the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:13.680
 blush and lipstick the wool line and make the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:15.420
 The same active thing washes it here. 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.200
 these are the only blocks if you 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.200
 need to have 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.799
 're seeing is that is simple to company 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.420
 has water dispenser and alan attack 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.160
 push the right button if asking 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.810
 creative 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.570
 only this is necessary for it to work 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.150
 her I'm going I did here I closed all 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.730
 box to stay a little more beautiful 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.440
 has the method of the bis of this network tvone that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.980
 It's more known that I did not like it. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.390
 because you are an ore you have to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.489
 get down to find and such 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.510
 already with jalan after you do the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.430
 Hook you just need to kill spiders at 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.709
 anyone who wants to know how to make a hook that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.160
 You need you need a twig. 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.660
 a stick is not here to show 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.049
 how do you need a 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:13.769
 stick an iron bar and a wood 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:20.940
 refined to make the layoff you need 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:24.730
 of tony cubes from a bow and arrow 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.920
 sonnen in a bow arrow all the 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.930
 two and a redstone stone the fable 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:40.480
 here a nursery and I will show to 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:42.220
 Here to make the goal the hook 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.460
 You need to vote for wood here. 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.310
 refined the stick and the iron you win 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.690
 two hooks and to make the dispenser 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.550
 you make an inverted animals and bass 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.930
 and the bow and arrow in the middle and ready you 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.700
 has your dispensation 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.870
 so that's all it takes to 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.120
 being able to make an oxygen generator is fine 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.150
 easier to get the 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.910
 You're from being a cave and throwing water. 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.700
 on top of the lava but sometimes you are 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.180
 playing the custom map as sky 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.360
 block or sky grid that ends up limiting 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.150
 its availability 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.680
 lava here is an easy and 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.720
 simple to make a generator of 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.400
 oxygen and also if you want to 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:38.020
 not even need the exemption you just come 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:46.420
 Bine here just playing up here 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:48.160
 It works so you get back more 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.080
 then you do not even need to dispense 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.830
 dispensing only makes it much simpler to 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.690
 do 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.490
 so that's it, thank you. 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.780
 I hope this has taught there how 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.610
 make a generator and until the next video and 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.710
 also leave comments if you have 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.590
 someone special request for something 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.110
 Do you want to learn to do what? 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.630
 Do you want me to pee? 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.320
 leave in comments then it was worth and even 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.320
 the next video
