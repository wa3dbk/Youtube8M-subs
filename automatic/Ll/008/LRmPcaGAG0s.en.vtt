00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.590
 Here I am again. I'm on the Almafi coast 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.590
 Minori 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.890
 In a beautiful house of a friend of mine, Dominico. 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.050
 And I'm going to show you 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.060
 how to be the perfect 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.869
 "gnocchi di patate". 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.810
 To begin 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.279
 Do you need fantastic potatoes? 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.579
 What I recommend is a beautiful Mary Piper potato or a King Edward 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.560
 a very good one. 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.630
 You need one kilogram of potatoes. 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.110
 If I open them .. Look 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990
 The skin will come off in no time. 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.450
 And they already look .. 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.230
 In my hands. 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.109
 They are ready. 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.869
 When you cook potatoes 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:55.720
 put them in cold water, lots of water. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.330
 Bring to the boil and let it cook for approximately 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.880
 fifteen to twenty minutes 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.630
 This is approximately the size of the potato. If you have something bigger .. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 just cook them for ten minutes extra, then they are good too. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 I advise you to invest in a good potato press. 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 Do not blend it or use a fork. 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 You wait until they have cooled slightly. When they have cooled you remove the skin .. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.900
 puts them in the potato press .. 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.790
 Look! 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.840
 And with a few strong hands it will look nice. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.710
 I will continue with this. 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.189
 Yes! Yes! 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.240
 This is how I want them. 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.110
 Until they .. 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.690
 all are ready. 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.390
 We will go there again. Ready. 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 You have one kilo of beautiful potatoes. Look. 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.770
 Here they are all. 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.290
 It's dry 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.900
 not wet. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.560
 And silky smooth. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.730
 Don't try to mold it too much, don't try to edit it too much. 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.989
 Because the more you process it, the more water goes out. 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.260
 This part is easy. 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.009
 Use salt, okay? 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.469
 Make sure you can also see the salt that you use. 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.419
 Salt flakes are fantastic. Rub them between your hands, look. 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:35.239
 Look. 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.889
 Pepper, watch it fall down. 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:42.059
 Just a little bit. Now I have to add egg. 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.560
 Why I do that .. 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.169
 is because the egg yolk binds everything 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.059
 and keep everything together 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:51.749
 For one kilo 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:52.829
 potatoes 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.699
 I use two egg yolks. 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.359
 Let it run between your fingers. 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.649
 Egg yolk in it. 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.029
 From two eggs. 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.890
 Flower is also very important. 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.719
 Do not use too much flour. 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.779
 I need a hundred grams 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.680
 from "double zero" flower. 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.019
 Make sure you use "double zero". 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.839
 "double zero" is extra fine. 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:25.839
 One hundred and fifty grams, let's see .. 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:32.739
 Everything in it. 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.519
 So easy. 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.159
 Here you can see that I also use rice flour. 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.989
 But I don't use rice flour to mix in, just to roll it out. 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.369
 That also dries the potato out a bit. 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.810
 Mix it. Always use your hands if they are clean. See how I do it. 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.449
 Make sure 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.429
 that all the egg, everything is included. 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:04.429
 But don't edit it too much. 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.279
 You can see here on this board 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.299
 Everything has been recorded, it is dry. 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.069
 And it's okay if you can still see the egg. 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.879
 We still have to 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.100
 unroll. 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.789
 A little bit of rice flour. 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.539
 Roll it over it. 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.139
 And you see how beautiful it gets, look! 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.150
 It stays together. I just washed my hands. 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.529
 It is very important that you go after making the gnocchi 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.069
 cleans your hands. Fantastic, that's done. 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.160
 Look. 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.869
 You can see how beautiful it is. That little bit of rice flour ensures that 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.190
 the cutting board stays nicely dry. 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.520
 Get a knife now 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.969
 and cut off a piece. 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.430
 I'm going to cut it further. Look. 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.490
 You can 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.050
 see all the egg inside 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.819
 a little pepper, and you can see the potato. 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.509
 Roll it gently. 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.900
 You can see that it all stays together when rolling. 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.110
 Just a little bit 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.340
 rice flour 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.069
 on top. 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.419
 Cut it. 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.419
 Put them next to each other. Grab a knife .. 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.139
 And you have perfect gnocchi ready for cooking. And if you like them 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.669
 do not want to be in this form .. 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.460
 If you want them more around, grab one .. 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.729
 put it between your hands and roll it. 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.430
 Then you get nice round gnocchi. 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.509
 If you want it a bit different 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:46.509
 grab a fork 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:50.879
 and press it on it, look. 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.080
 If you are 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.909
 If you want to do something else, grab one in your handem 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.599
 press your finger in and roll it between your fingers. 

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:04.880
 And then you make it again. With a small slot here 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.090
 and also the small lines 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.690
 on the other side. 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.360
 But .. come on! 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.719
 This is good enough. 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.449
 If you want to see how I cook this fantastic gnocchi 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.080
 please don't forget to go to the Jamie Oliver 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.539
 Food Channel to go on YouTube. 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.050
 And then you see how I prepare this gnocchi 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.370
 and lots of other dishes.
