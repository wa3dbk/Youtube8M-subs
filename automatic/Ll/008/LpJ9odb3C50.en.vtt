00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.609
 hello everyone just came from the post office 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.619
 got fresh parcels now we are with 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 you will see what is here for us 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.760
 I came to it so he had all the flags 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.019
 have to come because i'm honest 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.019
 saying did not check by track number 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.260
 here we came original cover 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 lenovo 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 cover book for lenovo s820 model 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 here is such a red phone than 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.449
 This is interesting because it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.500
 replaces the back cover 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:09.590
 in fact , firstly it fixes well 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:16.560
 phone crypto quickly here and secondly 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:19.369
 while having a nice beautiful view once 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.369
 show you how it looks 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:35.910
 here so here magnet even 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:39.960
 deer or then i'm random yes and 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:45.820
 unlocked automatically locked 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.410
 here even such a function is well so 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.960
 looks good 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.280
 here it is here we seem to be like 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.280
 artificial skin on it as if 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.960
 rubberized think this is some kind of under 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.720
 impregnated water pushes here 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.200
 lenovo logo 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.660
 back cover absolutely repeats 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.230
 the original is perhaps a little bit 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.450
 different shade so how much is that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.020
 I do not remember that everything will be links under the video 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.820
 there will be links to the seller in there 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.190
 look because now is not 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:29.130
 I remember that why is it like that 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.130
 the final cover 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:46.500
 so the next disc in the package wrapped 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:03:06.010
 electric train so visby 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:07.420
 Dad Dad I ordered a reference at all 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 there will be a patch video 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:19.600
 so no one is sending out by 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.780
 so fast too, had to 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.340
 study 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:31.090
 wants end stock unpack you 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:34.750
 show so it's not such a success 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.820
 very long wire somewhere centimeter i 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.820
 I think 50 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.959
 yusbi 20 times two three 4 5 six 7 ports 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.659
 what is the light on indication 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.830
 switch for each port 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:04:00.120
 plastic is so cheap in general 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:03.989
 very easy Well, that is such a farm 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.590
 so it sits down here it is the big one 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.590
 package yes except that there should be 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.729
 I do not think I did not order myself 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.970

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:34.669
 gymnic most likely just put 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:34.669
 here we have this 3 here this massage 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.370

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.090
 crib banks so on 12,000 milliamps hours 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:08.190
 LED charge indication is working 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:13.280

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:26.039

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:31.919

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:44.639

 onion garbage and that is obtained in 4 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.330

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.610

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:58.610
 Well, you need to test you need to check 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:02.130
 how many hours is there actually a milliamp 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.139
 because the Chinese like to fool like that 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.490
 Canopy principle is heavy and I think there 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:11.699
