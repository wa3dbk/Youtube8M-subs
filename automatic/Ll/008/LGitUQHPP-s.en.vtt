foot the last thing I want to talk about
here<00:05:51.820> on<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.030> x1<00:05:52.419> is<00:05:52.810> I'm<00:05:52.900> going<00:05:53.020> to<00:05:53.080> flip<00:05:53.349> it

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
here on the x1 is I'm going to flip it

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.200 
here on the x1 is I'm going to flip it
underneath<00:05:53.800> we're<00:05:54.490> gonna<00:05:54.580> look<00:05:54.729> at<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:54.970> sole

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
underneath we're gonna look at the sole

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.330 
underneath we're gonna look at the sole
so<00:05:55.810> it's<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:55.990> skywalk<00:05:56.289> sole<00:05:56.770> which<00:05:56.950> means<00:05:57.160> that

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
so it's a skywalk sole which means that

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.430 
so it's a skywalk sole which means that
CD<00:05:57.669> or<00:05:57.880> speedy<00:05:58.240> has<00:05:58.450> said<00:05:58.660> rather<00:05:58.840> they<00:05:59.260> said

you have the speedy design incorporated

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.830 
you have the speedy design incorporated
here<00:06:15.250> with<00:06:15.370> the<00:06:15.460> technology<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:16.090> skywalk<00:06:16.599> I'm

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
here with the technology of skywalk I'm

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.240 
here with the technology of skywalk I'm
gonna<00:06:16.990> give<00:06:17.169> it<00:06:17.199> an<00:06:17.380> 8<00:06:17.620> out<00:06:17.800> of<00:06:17.830> 10<00:06:17.949> on<00:06:18.220> the

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
gonna give it an 8 out of 10 on the

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.400 
gonna give it an 8 out of 10 on the
stiffness<00:06:18.580> scale<00:06:18.970> I<00:06:19.150> find<00:06:19.660> that<00:06:19.780> for<00:06:19.960> a<00:06:19.990> sport

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
stiffness scale I find that for a sport

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.529 
stiffness scale I find that for a sport
boot<00:06:20.590> of<00:06:20.710> this<00:06:20.889> nature<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.729> almost<00:06:22.000> is<00:06:22.210> kind<00:06:22.449> of

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
boot of this nature it almost is kind of

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.210 
boot of this nature it almost is kind of
in<00:06:22.690> between<00:06:22.810> a<00:06:23.020> sport<00:06:23.440> and<00:06:23.590> a<00:06:23.650> touring<00:06:23.979> style

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
in between a sport and a touring style

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.850 
in between a sport and a touring style
stiffness<00:06:24.729> there<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.240> reinforcement<00:06:25.860> in

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
stiffness there is a reinforcement in

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.010 
stiffness there is a reinforcement in
this<00:06:27.220> in<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.669> sole<00:06:27.940> as<00:06:28.180> well<00:06:28.479> and<00:06:28.690> you<00:06:28.750> can<00:06:28.870> see

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
this in the sole as well and you can see

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.469 
this in the sole as well and you can see
that<00:06:29.169> it's<00:06:29.320> a<00:06:29.470> high<00:06:30.010> grip<00:06:30.310> non-slip<00:06:30.970> anti-oil

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
that it's a high grip non-slip anti-oil

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.080 
that it's a high grip non-slip anti-oil
sole<00:06:32.110> here<00:06:32.349> it's<00:06:32.830> it's<00:06:33.099> similar<00:06:33.520> technology

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
sole here it's it's similar technology

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
that we see from skywalk and you even

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.290 
that we see from skywalk and you even
have<00:06:36.099> a<00:06:36.130> different<00:06:36.490> tread<00:06:36.699> pattern<00:06:37.030> here<00:06:37.180> as

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
have a different tread pattern here as

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.400 
have a different tread pattern here as
you<00:06:37.419> get<00:06:37.539> up<00:06:37.570> to<00:06:37.750> the<00:06:37.840> ball<00:06:37.990> of<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.229> foot

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
you get up to the ball of the foot

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.890 
you get up to the ball of the foot
depending<00:06:38.860> on<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:39.849> scenario<00:06:40.060> depending<00:06:40.810> on

depending on the scenario depending on

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.510 
depending on the scenario depending on
how<00:06:41.050> aggressively<00:06:41.620> you're<00:06:41.800> riding<00:06:42.160> you<00:06:42.430> know

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
how aggressively you're riding you know

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.490 
how aggressively you're riding you know
I<00:06:42.550> find<00:06:42.970> myself<00:06:43.060> on<00:06:43.599> all<00:06:43.630> of<00:06:43.930> my<00:06:44.050> sport<00:06:44.349> boots

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
I find myself on all of my sport boots

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.409 
I find myself on all of my sport boots
tending<00:06:45.070> to<00:06:45.190> wear<00:06:45.460> out<00:06:45.640> this<00:06:45.880> area<00:06:46.150> of<00:06:46.330> the

tending to wear out this area of the

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:48.300 
tending to wear out this area of the
boot<00:06:46.599> first<00:06:46.870> so<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.500> potential<00:06:47.830> different

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310

out hopefully will give you
some<00:06:50.870> better<00:06:51.110> longevity<00:06:51.410> if<00:06:51.980> you're<00:06:52.100> riding

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
some better longevity if you're riding
