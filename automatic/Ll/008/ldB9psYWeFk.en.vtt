the biggest thing and major thing I want
to<00:01:49.140> update<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.600> basically

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
to update is that you can basically

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.200 
to update is that you can basically
essentially<00:01:52.890> use<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.549> dragon<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:56.310> fire

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
essentially use any dragon that has fire

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.539 
essentially use any dragon that has fire
or<00:01:57.479> plant<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.899> think<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:58.920> you'll<00:01:59.490> have

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
or plant I think basically you'll have

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910 
or plant I think basically you'll have
to<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.210> use<00:02:00.420> fire<00:02:00.780> dragon<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.619> plant

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to just use fire dragon and plant

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
to just use fire dragon and plant
dragons<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:03.000> recommended

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
dragons but it's the most recommended

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
dragons but it's the most recommended
combination<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:05.430> video<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
combination in this video I'm going to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.949 
combination in this video I'm going to
show<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.259> use<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
