request<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.539> tutorial<00:00:27.900> about<00:00:28.350> the<00:00:28.650> salt

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
request a tutorial about the salt

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
request a tutorial about the salt
technique<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.609> watercolor<00:00:30.180> now<00:00:30.420> this

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
technique with watercolor now this

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.500 
technique with watercolor now this
technique<00:00:31.020> is<00:00:31.289> similar<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.910> alcohol

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
technique is similar to the alcohol

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.119 
technique is similar to the alcohol
watercolor<00:00:34.019> technique<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.650> I<00:00:34.800> will<00:00:34.980> link

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 
watercolor technique which I will link

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.740 
watercolor technique which I will link
in<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.580> downbar<00:00:35.730> below<00:00:35.970> if<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> haven't

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
in the downbar below if you haven't

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.259 
in the downbar below if you haven't
watch<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.080> yet<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> creates<00:00:38.670> kind<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
watch that yet but it creates kind of a

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.180 
watch that yet but it creates kind of a
different<00:00:39.720> effect<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.229> not<00:00:40.290> exactly<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
different effect it's not exactly the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.270 
different effect it's not exactly the
same<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.729> alcohol<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.479> I<00:00:42.510> thought<00:00:43.280> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
same as the alcohol so I thought this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
same as the alcohol so I thought this
was<00:00:44.489> requested<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.120> me<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.269> do<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.659> I<00:00:45.720> thought

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
was requested for me to do so I thought

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.780 
was requested for me to do so I thought
I<00:00:46.199> might<00:00:46.589> as<00:00:46.680> well<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.040> one<00:00:47.220> to<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.549> along

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
I might as well do this one to go along

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.509 
I might as well do this one to go along
with<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.449> what<00:00:49.290> happens<00:00:49.650> when<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.309> use

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
with that so what happens when we use

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.549 
with that so what happens when we use
salt<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.000> watercolor<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.839> that<00:00:52.049> the<00:00:52.260> salt

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
salt with watercolor is that the salt

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
salt with watercolor is that the salt
absorbs<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:54.120> water<00:00:54.799> off<00:00:55.799> the<00:00:55.860> paper<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.580> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
absorbs the water off the paper and it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.750 
absorbs the water off the paper and it
pulls<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.420> paint<00:00:57.949> across<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.250> paper<00:00:59.430> which

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
pulls the paint across the paper which

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.969 
pulls the paint across the paper which
makes<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.299> interesting<00:01:00.930> effect<00:01:01.229> this<00:01:01.769> is

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
makes an interesting effect this is

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.649 
makes an interesting effect this is
different<00:01:02.430> than<00:01:02.519> that<00:01:02.580> ringed<00:01:03.059> fisheye

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
different than that ringed fisheye

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.350 
different than that ringed fisheye
effect<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.680> alcohol<00:01:05.159> makes<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.210> can

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
effect that the alcohol makes so you can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
effect that the alcohol makes so you can
use<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.690> two<00:01:06.840> together<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.680> some<00:01:07.860> very

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
use the two together for some very

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.570 
use the two together for some very
different<00:01:09.140> yet<00:01:10.140> kind<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> similar<00:01:10.890> effects<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
different yet kind of similar effects in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.300 
different yet kind of similar effects in
watercolor<00:01:12.329> paintings<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.320> best<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:13.859> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
watercolor paintings it's best to use a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.969 
watercolor paintings it's best to use a
more<00:01:14.789> coarse<00:01:15.270> salt<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.710> demo

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
more coarse salt with this in my demo

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.069 
more coarse salt with this in my demo
that<00:01:17.250> you'll<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.579> I'm<00:01:17.759> using<00:01:17.939> three<00:01:18.539> courses

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
that you'll see I'm using three courses

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.560 
that you'll see I'm using three courses
of<00:01:19.289> salt<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.740> using<00:01:19.920> Epsom<00:01:20.430> salts<00:01:20.850> which<00:01:21.390> are

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of salt I'm using Epsom salts which are

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.169 
of salt I'm using Epsom salts which are
the<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.869> thick<00:01:22.409> chunks<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> salt<00:01:23.399> I'm<00:01:23.670> also

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
the very thick chunks of salt I'm also

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.060 
the very thick chunks of salt I'm also
using<00:01:24.359> coarse<00:01:24.929> sea<00:01:25.170> salt<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.679> then<00:01:25.859> I'm<00:01:25.920> using

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
using coarse sea salt and then I'm using

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.179 
using coarse sea salt and then I'm using
regular<00:01:27.109> sea<00:01:28.109> salt<00:01:28.380> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
regular sea salt kind of more the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.730 
regular sea salt kind of more the
consistency<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.090> table<00:01:30.600> salt<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.590> see

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
consistency of table salt so you can see

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.929 
consistency of table salt so you can see
the<00:01:31.859> difference<00:01:32.219> that<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> different<00:01:32.759> sizes

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the difference that the different sizes

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.169 
the difference that the different sizes
of<00:01:33.240> salt<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.619> way<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.789> this<00:01:35.969> is

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
of salt will make the way to do this is

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.539 
of salt will make the way to do this is
to<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.810> find<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.409> best<00:01:37.649> time<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to kind of find the best time in the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
to kind of find the best time in the
drying<00:01:38.909> process<00:01:38.999> of<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.659> watercolor<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.350> do

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
drying process of the watercolor to do

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.739 
drying process of the watercolor to do
this<00:01:40.799> if<00:01:41.609> you<00:01:41.759> try<00:01:41.999> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.600> your

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
this if you try to do it when your

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.739 
this if you try to do it when your
watercolor<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> already<00:01:43.710> too<00:01:43.890> dry<00:01:44.600> it's<00:01:45.600> not

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
watercolor is already too dry it's not

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.499 
watercolor is already too dry it's not
wet<00:01:46.170> enough<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> salt<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.520> absorb<00:01:47.969> any<00:01:48.359> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
wet enough for the salt to absorb any of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.209 
wet enough for the salt to absorb any of
the<00:01:48.570> water<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.679> it<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.009> won't

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
the water out of it so it really won't

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.580 
the water out of it so it really won't
make<00:01:50.460> any<00:01:50.729> effect<00:01:51.090> whereas<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.319> do<00:01:52.469> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
make any effect whereas if you do it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.669 
make any effect whereas if you do it
when<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:53.130> too<00:01:53.189> wet<00:01:53.899> then<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.380> salt

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
when it's way too wet then your salt

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.580 
when it's way too wet then your salt
actually<00:01:56.130> becomes<00:01:56.729> saturated<00:01:57.350> with<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
actually becomes saturated with the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
actually becomes saturated with the
water<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.249> actually<00:01:59.429> can't<00:01:59.969> absorb<00:02:00.509> any

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
water and it actually can't absorb any

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.080 
water and it actually can't absorb any
more<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.950> again<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.460> doesn't<00:02:02.609> really<00:02:02.759> leave

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
more so again it doesn't really leave

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.809 
more so again it doesn't really leave
you<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.539> very<00:02:03.869> much<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.170> effect<00:02:04.499> and<00:02:04.819> the

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
you with very much your effect and the

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:07.940 
you with very much your effect and the
other<00:02:06.090> thing<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.200> use<00:02:07.469> too<00:02:07.920> much

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
other thing is that if you use too much

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790 
other thing is that if you use too much
salt<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> your<00:02:08.910> water<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.500> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
salt to your water this is that all of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.700 
salt to your water this is that all of
your<00:02:10.979> paint<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.400> absorbed<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.180> again<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
your paint is absorbed and again it

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.140 
your paint is absorbed and again it
doesn't<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.069> leave<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.700> an<00:02:14.819> effect

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
doesn't really leave you with an effect

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.119 
doesn't really leave you with an effect
so<00:02:15.510> there's<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.170> lot<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.379> things<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:16.980> go

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
so there's a lot of things that can go

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.400 
so there's a lot of things that can go
wrong<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.549> this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
wrong with this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.800 
wrong with this
the<00:02:18.770> first<00:02:19.010> time<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.340> try<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.640> out<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.600> may

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
the first time you try it out you may

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.630 
the first time you try it out you may
not<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:21.140> effects<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.710> are<00:02:21.770> that<00:02:22.070> great<00:02:22.280> you

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
not get effects that are that great you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.250 
not get effects that are that great you
really<00:02:23.240> got<00:02:23.360> to<00:02:23.480> kind<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.660> play<00:02:23.810> around<00:02:23.990> with

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
really got to kind of play around with

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.370 
really got to kind of play around with
it<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:25.240> figure<00:02:26.240> out<00:02:26.360> when<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.810> opportune

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
it and figure out when the opportune

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.670 
it and figure out when the opportune
moment<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:28.040> put<00:02:28.310> your<00:02:28.460> salt<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
moment to put your salt in is the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.530 
moment to put your salt in is the
opportune<00:02:31.040> moment<00:02:31.070> basically<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.360> do

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
opportune moment basically is if you do

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.980 
opportune moment basically is if you do
a<00:02:32.570> flat<00:02:32.930> wash<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.530> your<00:02:33.680> paint<00:02:34.390> watch<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.720> and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
a flat wash of your paint watch it and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.690 
a flat wash of your paint watch it and
in<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.230> opportune<00:02:36.680> moment<00:02:36.710> it's<00:02:37.190> kind<00:02:37.490> of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
in the opportune moment it's kind of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.360 
in the opportune moment it's kind of
just<00:02:38.210> before<00:02:38.780> it's<00:02:39.380> about<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.710> lose<00:02:40.100> that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
just before it's about to lose that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.880 
just before it's about to lose that
Sheen<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.990> don't<00:02:42.170> want<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.440> do<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.650> when<00:02:42.770> it's

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
Sheen you don't want to do it when it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.710 
Sheen you don't want to do it when it's
like<00:02:42.950> super<00:02:43.430> glossy<00:02:43.760> because<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.510> means

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
like super glossy because that means

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.570 
like super glossy because that means
it's<00:02:44.870> very<00:02:44.930> wet<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.770> don't<00:02:46.040> want<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.460> do

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's very wet but you don't want to do

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.130 
it's very wet but you don't want to do
it<00:02:46.700> when<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:46.880> looks<00:02:47.180> matte<00:02:47.480> because<00:02:47.780> that's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
it when it looks matte because that's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.530 
it when it looks matte because that's
when<00:02:48.380> it's<00:02:48.500> too<00:02:48.680> dry<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.280> kind<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:49.970> right<00:02:50.210> where

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
when it's too dry so kind of right where

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.330 
when it's too dry so kind of right where
it's<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:51.080> middle<00:02:51.410> where<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:51.920> about<00:02:52.160> to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
it's in that middle where it's about to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.920 
it's in that middle where it's about to
kind<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.640> lose<00:02:52.820> its<00:02:53.030> Sheen<00:02:53.270> that's<00:02:53.660> when<00:02:53.870> you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
kind of lose its Sheen that's when you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.590 
kind of lose its Sheen that's when you
put<00:02:54.110> yourselves<00:02:54.470> on<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.980> yeah<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.880> kind<00:02:56.450> of

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
put yourselves on so yeah this kind of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720 
put yourselves on so yeah this kind of
does<00:02:56.870> require<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.530> actually<00:02:58.010> watching<00:02:58.460> paint

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
does require you actually watching paint

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.540 
does require you actually watching paint
dry<00:02:58.880> ah<00:02:59.450> which<00:03:00.170> isn't<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.560> most<00:03:00.680> exciting

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
dry ah which isn't the most exciting

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.490 
dry ah which isn't the most exciting
thing<00:03:02.300> in<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> world<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:03.080> fortunately

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
thing in the world but fortunately

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.520 
thing in the world but fortunately
watercolors<00:03:04.250> dry<00:03:04.460> very<00:03:04.760> fast<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.540> this<00:03:06.290> will

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
watercolors dry very fast so this will

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.040 
watercolors dry very fast so this will
happen<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.070> a<00:03:07.160> span<00:03:07.490> of<00:03:07.520> probably<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:08.450> within

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
happen in a span of probably like within

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.800 
happen in a span of probably like within
five<00:03:09.410> minutes<00:03:09.740> you<00:03:10.730> will<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.360> happening

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
five minutes you will see it happening

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.500 
five minutes you will see it happening
sometimes<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.800> may<00:03:12.920> even<00:03:13.190> wait<00:03:13.640> too<00:03:13.910> long<00:03:14.090> and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
sometimes you may even wait too long and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.940 
sometimes you may even wait too long and
then<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:14.900> realize<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.680> should<00:03:15.710> have

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
then you realize that you should have

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.370 
then you realize that you should have
done<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.250> earlier<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.030> it's<00:03:17.600> really<00:03:17.870> not<00:03:18.140> as

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
done it earlier so it's really not as

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.170 
done it earlier so it's really not as
bad<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.920> it's<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.190> basically<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.850> apply<00:03:20.120> it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
bad and it's so basically you apply it

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.390 
bad and it's so basically you apply it
to<00:03:20.420> your<00:03:20.540> wet<00:03:20.750> paint<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.530> sprinkle<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.190> salt

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
to your wet paint you sprinkle the salt

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.970 
to your wet paint you sprinkle the salt
on<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.750> leave<00:03:24.110> it<00:03:24.170> alone<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.950> you

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
on and then you leave it alone and you

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.280 
on and then you leave it alone and you
let<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.400> paper<00:03:25.610> completely<00:03:26.540> dry<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.230> then

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
let the paper completely dry and then

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.160 
let the paper completely dry and then
once<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.160> completely<00:03:28.580> dry<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.990> scrape<00:03:29.990> off

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
once it is completely dry you scrape off

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.470 
once it is completely dry you scrape off
your<00:03:30.230> salt<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.670> will<00:03:31.820> be<00:03:31.940> left<00:03:32.210> with<00:03:32.450> a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
your salt and you will be left with a

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.240 
your salt and you will be left with a
very<00:03:32.600> pretty<00:03:33.230> little<00:03:33.620> effect<00:03:35.170> that's

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
very pretty little effect that's

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.440 
very pretty little effect that's
basically<00:03:37.250> all<00:03:37.370> there<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.970> this<00:03:38.060> technique

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
basically all there is to this technique

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.910 
basically all there is to this technique
the<00:03:38.630> only<00:03:38.660> other<00:03:38.960> thing<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.260> want<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.500> add<00:03:39.620> it's

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
the only other thing I want to add it's

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.900 
the only other thing I want to add it's
kind<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.160> an<00:03:40.280> FYI<00:03:40.460> is<00:03:41.060> salt<00:03:41.950> can<00:03:42.950> change<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.550> pH

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
kind of an FYI is salt can change the pH

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.990 
kind of an FYI is salt can change the pH
of<00:03:43.940> your<00:03:44.210> paper<00:03:44.660> which<00:03:45.440> affects<00:03:45.920> its<00:03:46.190> archival

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
of your paper which affects its archival

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.690 
of your paper which affects its archival
value<00:03:47.720> so<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.890> best<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.280> use<00:03:49.520> this

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
value so it is best to use this

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.120 
value so it is best to use this
technique<00:03:50.150> for<00:03:50.600> things<00:03:51.050> like<00:03:51.260> mixed-media

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
technique for things like mixed-media

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.550 
technique for things like mixed-media
journals<00:03:53.830> things<00:03:54.830> like<00:03:55.310> any<00:03:55.730> type<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.560> collage

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
journals things like any type of collage

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.640 
journals things like any type of collage
where<00:03:58.250> you're<00:03:58.640> going<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.270> maybe<00:03:59.750> scan<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.470> and

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
where you're going to maybe scan it and

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.820 
where you're going to maybe scan it and
use<00:04:01.010> prints<00:04:01.850> of<00:04:02.209> your<00:04:02.420> work<00:04:02.720> basically<00:04:03.709> what

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
use prints of your work basically what
