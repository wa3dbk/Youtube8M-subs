00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.500
 how well camouflaged letters in 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.240
 a note 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.000
 well today that's what I'm going 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.130
 teach you how to do it first 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.130
 need an installation help 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:32.770
 a battery another battery of the led 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:38.770
 in addition to the LEDs and then that it 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:43.780
 fate and again that and that and that makes of a 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.190
 mocking and a well camouflaged network of 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.440
 ugly 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.050
 so I'm going to show you how a little 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 camouflaged in an original way and and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 discrete cables and LEDs between 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 lego first of all you have to conceal 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.800
 the battery so in a structure in 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.330
 general high here I put pillars 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.490
 stairs to be able to hide the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.100
 battery then you have to hidden 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 the switch that in general is just 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.830
 beside 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.670
 the problem is that you can 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.600
 have a limited amount of help that you 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.760
 can plug in 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990
 in this case it's 8 in general 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.260
 it's between 8 and 6 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.580
 it does not go further 12h01 guys so 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:43.540
 there I will bring them to sell and 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.820
 how does it work here we have all the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.130
 led in periphery that I wanted 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.560
 install under the stairs to make 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.409
 lights that rage the ground so 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.200
 to get to my ends I used to 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.240
 each time wool beads because the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.130
 wool does not walk two and I have them 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.150
 hung using small pieces that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.150
 I'll show you just now 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.600
 the second problem is that in general 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.200
 we do not have that place to put 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.530
 all LED 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.390
 so what I did to bring all 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.380
 the letters that is clear here is that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.950
 I ramified my facilities and but 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:38.050
 cable I passed them 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:40.420
 here what is not seen at all I 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.360
 generally pass the cables under 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.310
 a plate like these what is 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.130
 relatively discreet that allows them to 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.400
 bring to silwan in this case 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.830
 I use led under the earth of the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.060
 nature because here it's a green space with 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.269
 vegetation and it's a bit more 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.610
 hard only in an urban environment with 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.260
 pipes and everything but that's 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.170
 possible because it is enough to make a 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.610
 only layer of earth we have left 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.670
 two more problems 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.410
 how to hide all these cables 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.230
 once they get where they want 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.120
 that they arrive and especially the new 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.500
 light switch 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.450
 so what I used in this 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.260
 mock and well it's a rock so a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.000
 a natural structure 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.340
 we do not wonder about when 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.049
 we see in the mock we say ok 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.989
 it's a rock since his talents at 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.470
 a bit original like no other 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.540
 as you can see 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.790
 different parts of it do not 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.220
 are not supportive an effect here we have 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.500
 several parts that fit together 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.480
 allow to make a sloped rock and 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.970
 very original this allows two no 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.049
 only to make an unusual rock 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.040
 but mostly to hide stolen because when 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:18.370
 I remove this part of the project 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.579
 discover all the LEDs that are 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.849
 the inside and the switch that I 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:29.860
 can operate 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:33.120
 we have here all the led lights and we 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.120
 do not see any cable 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:44.900
 I'm attacking the penultimate problem that 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:51.170
 is camouflaged the LED itself there is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:55.640
 for these we will use some of 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:05:00.320
 pieces that serve as a terminal of come 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:04.610
 of the amp and we will slip the wool 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.630
 in like this is for against for 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.940
 fix this marker 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.010
 well, we're going to make it a bit complicated 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.790
 things because she does not hold everything 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.270
 only one must find a way of 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.870
 to fit 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.490
 I will show you two ways of 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.110
 maya that I use more frequently 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.890
 when it comes to camouflaging LEDs to 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.990
 ground the first technique and use it 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:36.920
 a gray plate like this is there 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.130
 drag out the LED and attach the 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.130
 thick headed 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.660
 it makes us interdependent we all 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.940
 can attach to the ground provided that there 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.390
 has a negator between the ground and the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.390
 plate with holes 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:05.150
 here we see this way in 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.420
 no way the led you can do that 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.950
 as many times as you want as long as you 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:14.840
 have led and that make you very pretty 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:25.790
 we also have this technique which consists of 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:33.260
 to put 3 tenons like that and then 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:36.760
 slide the led and put the fourth 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:40.210
 this technique is also effective but 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:45.110
 carey she is a little less showy 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:47.480
 because there is no grid but we can 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:52.130
 do it with the LEDs that are 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:55.000
 really hungry it's it's pretty hard to 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:59.210
 to realise 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.500
 so why put LEDs in a 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.900
 moc well already because it adds a 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.670
 touches a bit professional and that makes 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.880
 the difference in a competition 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.730
 for example between two creations 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:18.190
 almost equal when I have one that has some 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:22.790
 led well installed it makes really well 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:27.470
 then second reason is because it 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:31.250
 much more credible arrange and and 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:33.680
 realistic creations so here 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:37.100
 I hope you enjoyed this little tutorial 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.710
 I do not do anything again on the LEDs a 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.520
 second on the installation of LEDs at the 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.670
 ceiling what there was more ground 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.720
 so here is subscribe you put a little 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.360
 comment 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.920
 to tell me if you liked it and 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.920
 here you go ciao
