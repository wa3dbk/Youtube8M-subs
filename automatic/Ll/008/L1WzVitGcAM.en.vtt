00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
have stride now what stride is is it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
have stride now what stride is is it
allows<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> draw<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:53.940> passcode<00:00:54.570> instead

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

of<00:00:55.050> typing<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.430> draw<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of typing it in you can draw it so I'm a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.569 
of typing it in you can draw it so I'm a
slide<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> unlock<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> draw<00:00:59.430> my

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
slide to unlock down here and draw my

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.849 
slide to unlock down here and draw my
pass<00:00:59.820> code<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> checkmark<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.079> my

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
pass code which is a checkmark and my

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
pass code which is a checkmark and my
device<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.550> unlocked<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:03.390> stride<00:01:03.750> does

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
device is now unlocked now stride does

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
device is now unlocked now stride does
have<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> few<00:01:04.470> options<00:01:04.680> one<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.489> turn<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
show the green highlights so that when
you're<00:01:10.080> drawing<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.950> highlight<00:01:11.189> what

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
you're drawing it will highlight what
you're<00:01:11.700> drawing<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> green<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> also

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you're drawing and green you can also

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.950 
you're drawing and green you can also
change<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.010> pass<00:01:14.310> code<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
change your pass code here so this is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.420 
change your pass code here so this is
where<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.350> draw<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
where you can draw what it is and then

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
where you can draw what it is and then
you<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> few<00:01:17.939> options<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.450> terms<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.810> how

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
is known as magic badges so this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.210 
is known as magic badges so this
particular<00:03:06.750> tweak<00:03:07.350> you'll<00:03:07.500> notice<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> my

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
particular tweak you'll notice that my

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.220 
particular tweak you'll notice that my
badges<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.880> look<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.209> little<00:03:09.480> bit<00:03:09.690> different

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
badges here look a little bit different

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.390 
badges here look a little bit different
as<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.860> they're<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.070> little<00:03:11.190> bit

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
as you can see they're a little bit

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.160 
as you can see they're a little bit
bigger<00:03:11.610> they're<00:03:12.060> also<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.600> bottom<00:03:12.959> right

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
bigger they're also in the bottom right

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.780 
bigger they're also in the bottom right
corner<00:03:13.200> instead<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> top<00:03:14.280> right<00:03:14.550> corner

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
corner instead of the top right corner

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.060 
corner instead of the top right corner
so<00:03:15.120> if<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.300> happen<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.630> my<00:03:15.840> settings<00:03:16.290> into<00:03:16.530> magic

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
so if I happen to my settings into magic

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.009 
so if I happen to my settings into magic
