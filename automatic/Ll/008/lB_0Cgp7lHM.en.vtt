00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:21.539
 keep in the middle are equal 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:23.150
 when we do not have water to hit a 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.800
 fan 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.800

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.110
 well and then let's start with the video 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:42.790
 today and good as it says in the title is 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.370
 let's make goals in minecraft 1.8 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.010
 point 8 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.199
 and well, the people who carry 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.500
 time with the minecraft they should know 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.470
 not like that 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.710
 but for those who do not know well we are going to 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.710
 do 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.729
 he appeared to us in the middle of a village 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.630
 Quick 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.119
 what materials do they need? 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.119
 so the search engine will search 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.850
 of iron 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850
 pumpkin 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.180
 snow 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.910
 and then his sword to defend yourself 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.450
 also creative because they are going to fly 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.609
 in this way one on top of the other 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.289
 from the last one above 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.789
 up and the pumpkin puts it up and 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.789
 Well, the goal is going to be created 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.480
 and good 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.510
 they will ask good then if so 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.010
 does the golem so he asked me for snow 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.010
 they are going to put two snow 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.060
 and on top of the snow they are going to put another 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.420
 and then it is created 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.910
 mini golem could be said of snow with 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.710
 a little 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.710
 but that's not why he wants 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.450
 that the damage is much less yes 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.450
 but good 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.420
 I'm going to pause the video some friends 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.420
 to continue where we stay 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.460
 to come back let's do the screen 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.460
 big 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.440
 and well let's do what we 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.440
 we are doing 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.580
 where he stayed millions 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.900
 behind the moon 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.770

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.990
