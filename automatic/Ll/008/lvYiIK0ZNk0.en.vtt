00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
I got to kind of see how it plays out

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.410 
I got to kind of see how it plays out
because<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:13.130> they're<00:03:14.130> not<00:03:14.550> happy<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.300> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420

because if they're not happy with you
there<00:03:15.630> with<00:03:15.810> shit<00:03:16.770> I'll<00:03:16.980> go<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.310> for<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
there with shit I'll go in for it I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.000 
there with shit I'll go in for it I
don't<00:03:18.120> care<00:03:18.300> but<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.440> it'll<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.860> to

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
don't care but I think it'll have to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.580 
don't care but I think it'll have to
wait<00:03:20.040> until<00:03:20.370> after<00:03:20.580> homecoming<00:03:21.290> which<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.470> in

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
wait until after homecoming which is in

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.370 
wait until after homecoming which is in
about<00:03:22.680> two<00:03:22.980> weeks<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.959> think

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
about two weeks or so because I think

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.220 
about two weeks or so because I think
they<00:03:25.860> all<00:03:26.010> got<00:03:26.190> ass<00:03:26.370> already<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.360> I'm<00:03:27.600> just

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
gonna go by myself I guess I mean I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.250
