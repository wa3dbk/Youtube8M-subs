 still every one of you to the river well now 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.380
 let's see the pattern 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.380
 this one is mine 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.529
 what is people tell you when what 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.349
 identifies and calls me on the phone says 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.639
 it was the dolphin milestone so I know what 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.429
 that you are talking because 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.069
 it simply has a shape of a piquito 

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:29.989
 what makes it look like a little piquito 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.360
 of what we do for the 

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:34.069
 Christmas so much that there are perfect very well 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.610
 then this is the pattern and this pattern 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:39.589
 comes to within this package that is 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.889
 here I do not know right now let's make a cut 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:45.649
 and the return I show you how it is used 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.419
 correctly this pattern we are doing 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:50.229
 rapped fulfilling the promise that 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.229
 I made the return
