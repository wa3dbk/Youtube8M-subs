00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 I still have a quiz and that too 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.150
 this price 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.660
 that's the collector's edition to elder 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.370
 scrolls tamriel unlimited for xbox when 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.160
 we have the same thing though 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.520
 Also for the ps4 both are available 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.020
 to win each not together as 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.460
 a lucky winner goes with the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.260
 xbox version home a happy one 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.390
 winner goes with the ps4 version 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 home what is there in there is one 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.290
 unboxing to this special edition resp 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.450
 to her predecessor on the pc is there 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 but mostly the same in it me 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.969
 I have that before again very briefly 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 looked at there is this mulack ball 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.160
 statue there is the artbook dicator and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.620
 so on and so on most of it 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 is just as received in the pc version 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.430
 that means who gets a good impression of it 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.840
 want to get what's in there like that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 looks like and so we pack this now 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.559
 not everything here again individually 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.239
 but I recommend a look 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.090
 to throw the old unboxing 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.100
 I'll show you that would be very up 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 I want to be sure that I can handle the number 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.689
 Googling, of course, what exactly 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 I am here to tell you something 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.689
 you have to do around this collector's 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.510
 edition either for xbox or 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.650
 ps4 to win and it's like always 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.930
 terrifyingly simple on gamestar and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 gamepro de there is a quiz at ten 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.840
 just ask about elder scrolls online and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.670
 to the developer bethesda and who this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 questions answered correctly I go 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 assuming that will be some of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.259
 can one of these two collector's 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.600
 to win edition 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.189
 Inter as a trap decides that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
 It should not be that question 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 so heavy are that actually only two 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.280
 get people out like the answers 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.689
 must be 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.350
 you can still participate until the 21st 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.930
 August until then, the answers must 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.979
 be delivered and then one could 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.270
 This wonderful collector's editions 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 you belong that is for the time being 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.799
 Last quiz and that's why I was saying 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 join now again and again what 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.450
 bag or just with that % that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 you answer all questions correctly 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.659
 i could in any way wish i like 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.659
