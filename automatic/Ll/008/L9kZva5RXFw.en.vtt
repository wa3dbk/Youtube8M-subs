00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the moment I don't disagree with that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.139 
the moment I don't disagree with that
they're<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> best<00:00:49.649> team<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> watch<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.940> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460

forum but I don't think they'll be the
champions<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.120> England<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.660> thought<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.739> game

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
champions of England I thought that game

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
champions of England I thought that game
against<00:00:56.640> Cardiff<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> sort<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.930> game

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
against Cardiff was the sort of game

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
against Cardiff was the sort of game
maybe<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:59.010> last<00:00:59.280> season<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.480> saw<00:01:00.780> would

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
maybe at last season that I saw would

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.170 
maybe at last season that I saw would
have<00:01:01.020> drawn<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.379> maybe<00:01:01.530> lost<00:01:01.890> after<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
have drawn or maybe lost after just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729

bit<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> goalkeepers<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.350> age

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
bit is that the goalkeepers come of age
