00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
on-site mixers for the main contractors
obviously<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.190> create<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.090> saving<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
obviously to create the saving so at the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.389 
obviously to create the saving so at the
end<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.790> about<00:00:39.059> workability

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
end it's it's really about workability

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.090 
end it's it's really about workability
slump<00:00:41.399> retention<00:00:42.110> really<00:00:43.110> also<00:00:43.739> strength

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
slump retention really also strength

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
slump retention really also strength
obviously<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> actually<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.200> away

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
obviously and and to actually take away

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.549 
obviously and and to actually take away
some<00:00:46.829> water<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.640> sometimes<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.539> cement<00:00:48.930> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
some water and sometimes some cement to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.369 
some water and sometimes some cement to
create<00:00:50.100> value-add<00:00:50.750> then<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.930> also<00:00:52.110> do

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
create value-add then we also do

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.650 
create value-add then we also do
concrete<00:00:52.969> rehabilitation<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> protection

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660

so<00:00:55.070> especially<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> aggressive<00:00:56.640> area

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so especially in the aggressive area

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.479 
so especially in the aggressive area
lock<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> Western<00:00:58.350> Cape<00:00:58.559> there's<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> lot

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
lock like the Western Cape there's a lot

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.470 
lock like the Western Cape there's a lot
of<00:00:59.579> combination<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.100> sea<00:01:02.340> sea<00:01:02.879> wind<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
of combination the the sea sea wind is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.890 
of combination the the sea sea wind is
not<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.379> thing<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:05.360> for<00:01:06.360> buildings<00:01:06.750> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
not a good thing for for buildings that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.480 
not a good thing for for buildings that
that<00:01:07.229> goes<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> rust<00:01:09.210> for

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
that goes and on and and rust for

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.990 
that goes and on and and rust for
corroding<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.750> steel<00:01:12.750> rebar<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.790> that's

corroding of steel rebar and and that's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.840 
corroding of steel rebar and and that's
something<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:15.900> special<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
something that we are really special is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.070 
something that we are really special is
specialising<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.060> Euclid<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.840> mainly

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
specialising so on the Euclid we mainly

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
specialising so on the Euclid we mainly
have<00:01:22.200> two<00:01:22.619> products<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> called<00:01:23.700> Euclid

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
have two products one is called Euclid

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.620 
have two products one is called Euclid
