00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.179
 this good this 1st 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.250
 but present 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.250
 they have asked us 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.470
 let's draw 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 correcting for it we would be here 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 total 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.250
 interior angles 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.250
 so 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.559
 this besides looking 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 these are the other community 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.320
 it consists of five birdies in the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.320
 which 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.050
 after having collected us 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 these are the cousins 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.860
 to calculate the coordinates that we're going 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 to do is to leave 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 known from the vertex 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.149
 to that result of sumo 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.490
 we can realize that our 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.490
 is a feeling 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.290
 well when starting from the coordinate 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.290
 10,000 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.220
 and heritage of the 5000 crown 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.500
 then to draw you can import 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.380
 these things 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.030
 sugar 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.600
 For this, what we are going to do is that 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.600
 we copy 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.600
 we copy 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.630
 so that now simply only the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.630
 values 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.940
 reception of coordinates 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.940
 once good coordinates 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.980
 the earthquake 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.819
 of the interior by eat 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.819
 saving 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.310
 if you want place where it's huge 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.630
 this is the original file 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.630
 and this 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.019
 we can with the block of us and 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.019
 We can see 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.320
 how 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.140
 and then they can draw on the other 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:42.580
 case what we are going to do is that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.580
 we review the units 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.940
 we are interested in meters 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.140
 Now we have created for convenience 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.700
 and other greens what we are going to do is 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.700
 that we copy all the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.880
 we copy them 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.319
 let's go to what yes 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.950
 for a while 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.959
 point time listen 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.720
 it's a kind of point that I can observe 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.720
 easily in this case I have chosen this 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 d 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.190
 and we're going to go 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.580
 several points 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.930
 then he asks us to specify a little 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.689
 look at the command bar 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.819
 control 1 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.070
 and what the program does is that we 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.070
 they draw 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.070
 two 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.699
 this procedure is very 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.569
 It is highly recommended when we do not have 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.569
 many crops 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.570
 from time drawing one by one if 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.670
 we want we can enter with one for a 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.830
 tooth 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.630
 we draw the world 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.630
 Now what we are going to do is that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.699
 when you put lines 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.360
 and where know the order of the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.240
 vertices 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.180
 sketch if necessary to be able 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.750
 come because I have already done 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.750
 this day 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.409
 if we want is 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:57.419
 checking what are 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.419
 increase the vertices 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.960
 26 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.449
 but the vertex with coordinates 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.030
 28 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.689
 four thousand four hundred 8,217 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.939
 if we do not know how we can use 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.939
 the how 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.639
 and gives us here the coordinates of 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.819
 Or simply 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.809
 and we design the 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:57.860
 just point this point and we 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.860
 delivery the crown 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:10.089
 we perform the calculation in the field 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:12.349
 we know that in this case as 

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:14.829
 strangled very well we know that it 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.829
 want 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.400
 yes 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.740
 in this case I can 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.280
 is to resort to this method to solve 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.280
 what a mind 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.860
 well thats all thank you very much and up
