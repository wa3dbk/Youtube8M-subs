00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.890
Hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars.com Ihad some time to spend with the 2010

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.460
Honda Insight it is supposed to be
if the price is the right way

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.690
the most affordable hybrid in the United
States another front and

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.540
kinda recall the FCX Clarity which is
there kind of experimental fuel cell

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.160
vehicle

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.950
don't actually based on the that is the
smallest car

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.670
now you know it's based on it from about
here forward

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.210
everything from behind that has been
made specifically for this car and

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.310
that's important because

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.690
by putting all the elements the gas tank
me

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.359
battery pack all that stuff exactly
where they want it as opposed to putting

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.699
into an existing model

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.410
they get to maximize the space on the
inside the interior quality is good

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.550
space wise %uh it's comparable to

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.980
the fit and also the Honda Civic which
also comes in a hybrid

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.680
the leg room is by the numbers is about
the same but what I find is even with

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.060
the siege act all the way up

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.220
which is adjustable going to happen on I
feel like I'm sittin pretty low

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
in my legs around from so even on the
numbers the same instead of sending

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.390
higher with my like down I'm sittin
little bit back this steering wheel

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.229
tilts and telescopes to which is good
helps people in different sizes to fit

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.270
scars actually pretty fun to drive a
drive just like any other car probably

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.020
more than

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.710
and any Honda hybrid so far the brakes
feel totally natural steering is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.299
actually

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.659
very natural fun to drive fundamental

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.030
grounded feel good handling to be more
than that the current

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.700
2009 Prius which is a known for its
driving while in

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.750
the ride is good I find in the back seat

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.790
the ride is actually better than it is
in the back seat behind a bit

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.170
put pen to write a little bit more
firmly I would wanna be the guy back

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.680
there

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.930
now to gasoline-electric hybrid like all
the Honda hybrids have been

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.430
no manual transmission you only get the
automatic affect me

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.030
continuously variable transmission if
you get the action level you can

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.649
shipping yourself just kinda funny
because seeking don't have here

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.970
but you know the human the people like
that on

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.680
again he acts has the center armrest the
other one doesn't and little things

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.450
maybe

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.080
like visor mirrors

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.320
back to find any alive just a way to
keep the price down on that one so they

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.850
can say

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.690
they have the most affordable hybrid on
the market now it's term some fish into

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.650
this one is rated

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.670
40 city and 43 highway up

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.180
thats why im here it's not great action
the Civic is 40 45 that's a more

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.450
expensive and have your car

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.920
up for what it's worth though I was
driving this one golden

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.280
econ mode which is fault mode come down
sub-par

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.519
let you be relied on the hell petaluma

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.629
sensitive and I was getting figures in
the high 40s

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.769
and PGs other people were getting you
know fifty-some miles per gallon so the

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.239
EPA estimates might be

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.480
underestimating we'll have to see so
even though the

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.670
EPA estimates a 40 43 are not great on
this car the reality seems to be better

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.830
than that and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.200
even know fuel prices were high for a
while in hybrids were hot

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.540
economy is gone soft and now it seems to
be about money

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.909
just the cost of the car hybrid
pentecost more the non-hybrid

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.000
so the fact that this is aiming to be
the most affordable hybrid

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.440
in the country it's not a bad place to
be for additional information on this

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.690
car or any other

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.519
got a car start com on our blog kicking
tires
