the level you go left you get no prize
it<00:00:37.829> takes<00:00:38.160> towards<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.519> eye<00:00:38.550> level<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.360> if

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it takes towards the eye level but if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.329 
it takes towards the eye level but if
you<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.629> right<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.440> face<00:00:40.680> off<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.159> some

up you just hop up there to go to the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:59.819 
up you just hop up there to go to the
exit<00:00:49.019> like<00:00:49.920> so

you reach this part of the level jump up

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.930 
you reach this part of the level jump up
to<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.559> top<00:01:02.710> here<00:01:02.769> stand<00:01:03.460> right<00:01:03.579> here<00:01:03.640> and

to the top here stand right here and

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.820 
to the top here stand right here and
just<00:01:04.119> shoot<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:05.170> know<00:01:05.229> that's<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.649> warp

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
just shoot and you know that's the warp

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.210 
just shoot and you know that's the warp
right<00:01:06.040> there<00:01:06.689> isn't<00:01:07.689> that<00:01:07.720> great<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.950> takes

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
right there isn't that great it takes

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.630 
right there isn't that great it takes
you<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.399> here<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:12.040> get<00:01:12.159> yourself<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.460> bunch

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
you in here and you get yourself a bunch

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.730 
you in here and you get yourself a bunch
of<00:01:12.729> free<00:01:12.909> apples<00:01:13.299> don't<00:01:14.229> get<00:01:14.409> hit<00:01:14.560> by<00:01:14.680> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
of free apples don't get hit by the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.679 
of free apples don't get hit by the
grammar<00:01:15.009> you<00:01:15.520> go<00:01:15.670> up<00:01:15.729> there<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.030> get<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.659> the

grammar you go up there and get to the

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:24.580 
grammar you go up there and get to the
warp<00:01:17.259> it<00:01:17.409> will<00:01:17.500> take<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.799> a<00:01:17.920> world<00:01:18.100> 14

assuming<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.310> took<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.759> warp<00:01:25.969> from<00:01:26.179> level<00:01:26.509> 11

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
assuming you took the warp from level 11

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.380 
assuming you took the warp from level 11
you<00:01:27.500> can<00:01:27.530> get<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:27.920> warp<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:28.250> one<00:01:28.369> for<00:01:31.390> you

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
you can get to the warp it one for you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.690 
you can get to the warp it one for you
get<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.810> do<00:01:33.020> some<00:01:33.289> swimming<00:01:33.469> and<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.280> get<00:01:34.490> to

the<00:02:09.930> easiest<00:02:10.140> way<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.320> get<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.920> just

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the easiest way to get this one is just

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.740 
the easiest way to get this one is just
to<00:02:11.100> fly<00:02:11.400> over<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.820> top<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.240> it<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.540> over

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
to fly over the top of it and go over

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.670 
to fly over the top of it and go over
there<00:02:12.870> however<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> by<00:02:14.460> jumping

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
there however you can do it by jumping
