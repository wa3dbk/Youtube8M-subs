right here now on the back you got these

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.610 
right here now on the back you got these
this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.130> barcode<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.820> used<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> scan

for<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> price<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.059> guessing

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
for the price and then here I'm guessing

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.600

this is the barcode that people come in

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
this is the barcode that people come in
with<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.110> cheat<00:00:40.500> sheets<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.040> try<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
with and they use cheat sheets to try to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.639 
with and they use cheat sheets to try to
get<00:00:41.489> their<00:00:41.640> favorite<00:00:42.270> character<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.379> each

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
get their favorite character so each

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.100 
get their favorite character so each
barcodes<00:00:44.190> unique<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.899> can

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
barcodes unique so that they can

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.729 
barcodes unique so that they can
identify<00:00:47.090> this<00:00:48.090> barcode<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.530> I
