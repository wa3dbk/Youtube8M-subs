00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.069
 the agenda continues with Cuban doctors 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.629
 On a timely basis you interviewed the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.099
 specialist in the subject how 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.599
 the Cuban medical diplomacy works 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:17.010
 I entered the times without frontiers that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.520
 tomorrow, the sociologist Julio does 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.189
 silva it for more than 30 years studying the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 Cuban medicine this issue of doctors 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
 Cubans to 1 around the world is not a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 very large number of Cuban doctors is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.210
 very interesting this story because 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 when it happened the Cuban revolution is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.770
 half of Cuba's doctors half escaped 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.050
 for miami 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.090
 with only three thousand doctors and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.579
 I only had 14 university professors 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.620
 medicine she threatens to end medicine 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 in cuba but very large investment 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 was what would raise him as a doctor 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.789
 this system of changing medicine 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.210
 make a community medicine to train 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.219
 a large number of doctors are to live 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 within communities to make a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.949
 preventative medicine and worked 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
 cuba today have health indexes 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 comparable to the best that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 united states the European country with the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.220
 my country of the world that has the largest number 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.170
 of physicians per capita 6.7 percent 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.049
 is an extraordinary thing three times the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 the American rate that the United States 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.400
 that with this surplus of doctors Cuba 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.439
 for decades has sent medical teams to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.770
 poor countries to countries where it has 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.390
 natural disasters is a program that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.450
 is considered by the world organization 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.070
 health care as a model for the rest of the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.259
 the world health organization 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.259
 I would like the Cuban model adopted 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.960
 other countries that medicine in which the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.600
 doctor came and within the community in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.700
 the doctor is and 24 hours 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 disposition of patients in that place 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.799
 where I live is very interesting the system 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.939
 and now Brazilians will live with 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.909
 these doctors 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.759
 so what she says is that in many 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.890
 countries such as venezuela in bolivia 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.270
 where there are a large number of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.920
 of Cuban doctors 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.739
 there was enormous resistance from 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.120
 associations of local doctors as is 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.530
 happening in brazil 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.740
 because 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.319
 there is resistance to changing the model is 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.540
 a different model is a very 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.430
 most popular much more community 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.350
 then there is enormous resistance from 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.470
 physicians were trained within a 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.810
 Another model for this innovation is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.420
 revolution in medicine 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.480
 so she explains why there are so many 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 resistance but in many countries such as 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.420
 venezuela is night in south africa 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 the Cuban doctors ended up 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.440
 very popular and the people who are 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.870
 they are very grateful for them. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.959
 millions of people in the world are 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.760
 600 thousand cases of blindness benefit 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.070
 blindness caused by 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.040
 vitamin were treated and cured by 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.410
 Cuban doctors in Africa is at last a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.450
 Something we have to take the hat off. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.890
 Cuban medicine is an example for the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.019
 world 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.840
 good and just remembering and then point the 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.930
 without frontiers with our point George 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.370
 It's going to air tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.370
 do not miss eliane aquino
