00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:41.510
 ubuntu bar theme we have seen this from 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.159
 this Sunday today I posted two videos 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.230
 one first of how to resize 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:49.460
 windows partitions a second video 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.319
 in which we have seen how it was installed 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.839
 linux in a very very simple way in 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.219
 ubuntu and in this third video well 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.769
 let's see how to uninstall 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.780
 agreements and for whatever reason 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.489
 Kansas, you do not want to keep having 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.070
 linux you're not going to spend it because it's very 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.299
 complex is not clear is you did not like it 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.670
 I know anything I have 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.240
 problems or has me whatever it is 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.000
 ok then let's see how to eliminate it 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.070
 very simple process you address to the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.140
 folder or directory to the unit 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.689
 where you have installed it according to 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.229
 this case is in the unit of in ubuntu 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.610
 and here directly an install comes 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.540
 in accordance w 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.710
 i 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.710
 we double click 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.030
 we say yes and now we proceed to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 the uninstall a simple process 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.270
 clean and simple without a doubt the point 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.090
 strong of all this we are seeing 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.399
 today is its simplicity the work with the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.780
 operating system that already is worth depends on 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.820
 each one I am showing how 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.110
 install and how to uninstall voucher for 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.210
 all of you who are curious 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.180
 we give it to finish and once you 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.120
 let's finish we'll restart the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.480
 system of agreement for it we come 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.950
 here we are going to subtract we say ok 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.840
 and the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.980
 the multi boot options now 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.739
 we will check that in the system 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.540
 effectively the files that before 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.420
 we had added that we had created 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.520
 that have been eliminated and that the boat is 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.320
 how it has to be 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.850
 to be very quick this video very 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.750
 simple the bases that the other one 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.430
 has stretched too much and did not want 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.610
 lengthen it for a minute more than the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.610
 installation 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.510
 we'll see 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 system at the moment it seems that is 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.680
 loading well 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.920
 we'll see 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.400
 If nothing strange happens it should 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.900
 load windows 8 and we should already 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.550
 to be able to continue working as if 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.410
 nothing would have happened 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.360
 Of course, yes, they have 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.510
 worked hard 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.510
 at this point the subject of 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.500
 facilitate the installation of a linux 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.900
 next to a windows that I would prefer that 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.989
 They will work on making it easier to do more 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.459
 simple other other parts but I do not know 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.720
 can have everything but let's see 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.720
 windows explorer 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.200
 we'll see 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.200
 why 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.970
 point 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.849
 empty discs according to the unit and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.730
 here the two files that had no longer 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:54.900
 we are going to look at now 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:59.580
 in the properties of my pc to see 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.960
 advanced systems settings let's see 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.170
 To who 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.000
 advanced &amp; start up and recovery we give 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.750
 settings 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.250
 and effectively has already been removed from the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.000
 list 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.850
 ubuntu as we see a very very process 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.890
 simple and that will not have greater 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.220
 complication for anyone to agree well 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.980
 that although I walk a little pissed 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.770
 with people who like to crush 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.020
 windows the linux users that they 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.820
 I like to crush windows because 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.820
 curiously I do not find that same 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.390
 in favor of the people that is him 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.920
 I do not see accuracy in homage in the 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.050
 windows users like how good to use 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.500
 linux use whatever you want 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.990
 quiet as it is that of windows 6 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.860
 windows you are a bit silly and is 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.540
 good 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.540
 it's a point that I do not like much 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.070
 and what more do I hope you are 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.720
