00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.180
 Hello, I decided to take off a small 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.069
 video review about a model of a patriot of you 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.920
 De Agostini company magazine series 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.820
 car in service 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.800
 caught me still took this by myself 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.039
 interest model for motley painted 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.279
 I understand that some kind of technical assistance 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.590
 incomprehensible to me 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.230
 roof construction I don't know why 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.880
 so what can we say therefore dori 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.730
 of course for the magazine series she 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.360
 everything is wonderful 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 places 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.640
 Well, with regards to the model of vans gazelles and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.950
 Sable principle I have not met 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.520
 no model which would 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.020
 I was pleased 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.370
 apparently very difficult to reproduce 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.420
 vans are somehow more interesting because 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 that models, in principle, will not convince the model 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:12.570
 just a banal ordinary toy that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:17.479
 concerns model uaz patriot bought for 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.400
 299 rubles, I generally am an amateur 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.240
 fans if we can say so models 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.610
 the car itself uaz patriot not 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 like very much done very very 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 good great sprue great quality 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.140
 performance of the body for 300 rubles to me 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.520
 there is simply nothing to complain about 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.369
 what I did with the usual 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 nail polish 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.729
 which without acetone I deleted the labels in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.850
 the forest guard did not like the color black 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.560
 inscription models forest guards me not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.810
 Naturally, I just wanted to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 imagine a black camp uaz patriot collection 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.790
 great car I deleted them 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.810
 very easy and easy to observe 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.650
 accuracy 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.920
 so that the solvent does not get on the card 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.420
 as they are also painted gray 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.920
 mimic plastic lining and not 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.239
 overdo it so as not to erase the main 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.700
 paint so try if to someone 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.670
 interesting model cool there is a model 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.610
 the deep modules for a long time I thought 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 whether to take it 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.739
 it costs good money for a long time to 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.930
 She watched there price of more than 2000 rubles 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.410
 but now looking at photos of this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.970
 models and trying to compare quality from 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.830
 glacier panels of the body itself in principle 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.920
 I do not know if there is such a big difference 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:12.709
 subsequently take off a small review about 2 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:17.250
 Muscovites who also I bought one 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.140
 dear don't remember to firm and other exactly 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 the same Muscovite bought a magazine series 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.760
 and to my regret there are particular differences, I am there 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.700
 not found 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.090
 Of course the quality of performance is high but 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.200
 body detailing what we turned out 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.989
 separate elements should be behind 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.819
 such prices made unfortunately 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.640
 turned out to be just plain painted 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.640
 details on sprue thanks
