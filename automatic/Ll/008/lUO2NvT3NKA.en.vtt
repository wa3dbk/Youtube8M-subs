he<00:04:27.810> was<00:04:27.930> playing<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.470> very<00:04:28.880> clear<00:04:29.880> way<00:04:29.940> two

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350

he was playing in a very clear way two
constituencies<00:04:31.350> back<00:04:31.650> home<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:32.180> think<00:04:33.180> when<00:04:33.300> he

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
constituencies back home I think when he

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.970 
constituencies back home I think when he
talks<00:04:33.540> about<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.870> economy<00:04:34.080> he<00:04:34.440> absolutely<00:04:34.740> is

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
talks about the economy he absolutely is

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.350 
talks about the economy he absolutely is
but<00:04:35.400> look<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.670> think<00:04:35.760> probably<00:04:35.970> more

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
but look I think probably more

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.240 
but look I think probably more
importantly<00:04:36.840> for<00:04:37.080> him<00:04:37.260> on<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.830> political

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
importantly for him on the political

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.920 
importantly for him on the political

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
christine lagarde said yesterday i think

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.820 
christine lagarde said yesterday i think
if<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.720> look<00:05:00.810> at<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.140> president's<00:05:01.590> approval

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
if you look at the president's approval

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.310 
if you look at the president's approval
rating<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.490> UK<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.270> fairly<00:05:03.840> high<00:05:04.110> it's

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
rating in the UK it's fairly high it's

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.390 
rating in the UK it's fairly high it's
certainly<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.620> lot<00:05:04.740> higher<00:05:04.890> than<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.370> here

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
certainly a lot higher than it is here

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.700 
certainly a lot higher than it is here
so<00:05:06.000> every<00:05:06.330> time<00:05:06.360> the<00:05:06.720> president<00:05:06.870> compliments

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
so every time the president compliments

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.650 
so every time the president compliments
how<00:05:08.070> Prime<00:05:08.520> Minister<00:05:08.850> has<00:05:08.940> done<00:05:09.120> economically

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
how Prime Minister has done economically

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.420 
how Prime Minister has done economically
how<00:05:10.140> he's<00:05:10.320> done<00:05:10.470> on<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.680> security<00:05:11.130> side<00:05:11.160> of

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
how he's done on the security side of

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.380 
how he's done on the security side of
things<00:05:11.550> that's<00:05:11.820> something<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.150> benefits

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
things that's something that benefits

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.720 
things that's something that benefits
him<00:05:12.960> for<00:05:13.380> 2015<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.250> think<00:05:14.460> it's<00:05:14.550> something

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
him for 2015 and I think it's something

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.730 
him for 2015 and I think it's something
that<00:05:14.940> David<00:05:15.450> Cameron<00:05:15.810> absolutely<00:05:16.350> is<00:05:16.470> willing

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
right now is sitting in Chicago a little

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.630 
right now is sitting in Chicago a little
bit<00:05:33.000> gnashing<00:05:33.840> his<00:05:33.930> teeth<00:05:33.990> over<00:05:34.410> that<00:05:34.580> maybe<00:05:35.580> a

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
bit gnashing his teeth over that maybe a

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.220 
bit gnashing his teeth over that maybe a
little<00:05:35.730> bummed<00:05:36.000> out<00:05:36.150> I<00:05:36.210> think<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.960> think<00:05:37.140> he

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
little bummed out I think I think he

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.720 
little bummed out I think I think he
would<00:05:37.350> have<00:05:37.440> liked<00:05:37.710> if<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.980> president<00:05:38.640> would

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
would have liked if the president would

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.450 
would have liked if the president would
have<00:05:38.820> tempered<00:05:39.150> his<00:05:39.180> his<00:05:39.660> is<00:05:40.500> willingness<00:05:41.220> to

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
have tempered his his is willingness to

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.400 
have tempered his his is willingness to
compliment<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.030> Prime<00:05:42.240> Minister<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.840> little

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
compliment the Prime Minister a little

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.170 
compliment the Prime Minister a little
bit<00:05:43.560> look<00:05:44.040> I<00:05:44.160> think<00:05:44.250> there's<00:05:44.580> no<00:05:44.700> denying<00:05:45.000> and

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
bit look I think there's no denying and

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.909 
bit look I think there's no denying and
David<00:05:45.360> Axelrod<00:05:45.720> knows<00:05:45.900> as<00:05:46.050> well<00:05:46.380> as<00:05:46.560> anybody

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
David Axelrod knows as well as anybody

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.260 
David Axelrod knows as well as anybody
the<00:05:47.430> two<00:05:47.580> of<00:05:47.729> a<00:05:47.790> really<00:05:48.000> good<00:05:48.120> relationship

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
the two of a really good relationship

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.450 
the two of a really good relationship
the<00:05:48.840> two<00:05:49.320> leaders<00:05:49.650> get<00:05:49.890> along<00:05:50.130> very<00:05:50.160> well

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
the two leaders get along very well

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.820 
the two leaders get along very well
probably<00:05:50.970> as<00:05:51.390> good<00:05:51.810> if<00:05:51.930> not<00:05:51.990> better<00:05:52.140> than<00:05:52.560> any

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
probably as good if not better than any

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.770 
probably as good if not better than any
relationship<00:05:53.040> with<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:53.610> foreign<00:05:53.940> leader<00:05:54.060> in

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
relationship with a foreign leader in

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.480 
relationship with a foreign leader in
the<00:05:54.960> world<00:05:55.140> for<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.500> president<00:05:55.890> right<00:05:56.010> now<00:05:56.070> so

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
the world for the president right now so

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.040 
the world for the president right now so
i<00:05:56.520> think<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.880> always<00:05:57.300> shows<00:05:57.510> through

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
i think that always shows through

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.450 
i think that always shows through
Margaret<00:05:58.440> mentioned<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.800> buddy-buddy<00:05:59.220> thing

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
Margaret mentioned the buddy-buddy thing

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.680 
Margaret mentioned the buddy-buddy thing
so<00:05:59.610> you're<00:05:59.760> always<00:05:59.940> going<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.270> see<00:06:00.419> that<00:06:00.570> when

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
so you're always going to see that when

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.140 
so you're always going to see that when
these<00:06:00.780> two<00:06:00.960> are<00:06:01.020> together
