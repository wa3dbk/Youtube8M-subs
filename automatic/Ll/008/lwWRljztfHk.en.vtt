know I know that there I think that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
know I know that there I think that
they're<00:01:35.040> doing<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
they're doing it so that the the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.789 
they're doing it so that the the
background<00:01:36.750> looks<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.110> little<00:01:37.229> darker

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
background looks a little darker

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.210 
background looks a little darker
compared<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.119> screen<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:40.200> um<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.100> just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
compared to the screen but um I just

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.429 
compared to the screen but um I just
like<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> white<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> deliberately<00:01:42.689> asked

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
like the white so I deliberately asked

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.560 
like the white so I deliberately asked
for<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> white<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> mean<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.880> no<00:01:45.299> longer

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
for the white but I mean it's no longer

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.620 
for the white but I mean it's no longer
slow<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.320> all<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:46.950> usually<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> fast<00:01:48.270> yeah

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
slow at all that's usually a fast yeah

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.840 
slow at all that's usually a fast yeah
yeah<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.560> took<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:49.979> liquor<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.640> not<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
yeah so it took at the liquor but not a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.960 
yeah so it took at the liquor but not a
bad<00:01:51.090> flicker<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:52.200> got<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> yes<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:53.369> inverts

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
bad flicker it's got the yes it inverts

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.819 
bad flicker it's got the yes it inverts
the screen<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> then<00:01:54.990> puts<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> back<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the screen and then puts it back with a

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
the screen and then puts it back with a
new<00:01:56.040> text<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.149> you're<00:01:57.240> gonna<00:01:57.390> see

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.850 
pretty much like the same contrast Nolan
it's<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.570> contrast<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.649> think

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it's the same contrast I think I think

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.959 
it's the same contrast I think I think
what<00:02:04.950> we're<00:02:05.070> seeing<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.520> we're<00:02:05.670> seeing<00:02:05.909> an

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
what we're seeing is we're seeing an

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.300 
what we're seeing is we're seeing an
evolution<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> software<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.649> they<00:02:08.160> use

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
evolution of the software that they use

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.589 
evolution of the software that they use
them<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> drive<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.970> for<00:02:09.119> example<00:02:09.330> they're

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
them to drive it for example they're

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.090 
them to drive it for example they're
probably<00:02:09.950> pre-rendering<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.730> pages<00:02:12.060> ahead

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
probably pre-rendering these pages ahead

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.620 
probably pre-rendering these pages ahead
that's<00:02:14.100> clever<00:02:14.370> which<00:02:14.940> they<00:02:15.090> weren't<00:02:15.360> doing

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
that's clever which they weren't doing

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.600 
that's clever which they weren't doing
before<00:02:15.990> yes<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.040> know<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.430> there

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
before yes because you know that there

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.070 
before yes because you know that there
were<00:02:17.760> there<00:02:17.850> was<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.600> know<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.960> was

were there was it you know there was

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.470 
were there was it you know there was
enough<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.500> delay<00:02:19.860> originally<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
enough of a delay originally that as you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.930 
enough of a delay originally that as you
were<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.870> last<00:02:22.050> line<00:02:22.650> or<00:02:22.890> two<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.550> page

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
were on the last line or two of the page

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.510 
were on the last line or two of the page
you'd<00:02:24.570> hit<00:02:24.780> next<00:02:25.050> page<00:02:25.440> because<00:02:26.160> he<00:02:26.280> knew<00:02:26.490> it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
you'd hit next page because he knew it

was<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.000> take<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.390> while<00:02:27.510> right<00:02:28.200> to

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
was going to take a while right to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.550 
was going to take a while right to
activate<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.400> that's<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.910> all<00:02:30.120> gone<00:02:30.450> now

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
activate that that's just all gone now

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.290 
activate that that's just all gone now
internal<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.100> feels<00:02:32.310> very<00:02:32.610> mature<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
internal it just feels very mature and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.960 
internal it just feels very mature and
you<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.590> target<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.460> addition<00:02:35.730> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
you know that target it in addition to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.430 
you know that target it in addition to
target<00:02:36.390> carrying<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.400> uh<00:02:38.720> staples<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.960> now

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
target carrying it uh staples is now

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.910 
target carrying it uh staples is now
going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.740> start<00:02:40.950> carrying<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> Kindles<00:02:41.840> Wow

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
going to start carrying the Kindles Wow

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.500 
going to start carrying the Kindles Wow
yeah<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.580> price<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.180> way<00:02:45.740> yes<00:02:46.740> 149<00:02:47.730> for

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
yeah and the price is way yes 149 for

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.130 
yeah and the price is way yes 149 for
the<00:02:48.630> Wi-Fi<00:02:49.110> only<00:02:49.140> 189<00:02:50.100> for<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.270> for<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.690> Wi-Fi

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the Wi-Fi only 189 for the for the Wi-Fi

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.200 
the Wi-Fi only 189 for the for the Wi-Fi
and<00:02:52.380> 3g<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.220> think<00:02:53.490> I'd<00:02:53.730> probably<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.120> get

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
and 3g so I think I'd probably just get

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.400 
and 3g so I think I'd probably just get
the<00:02:54.360> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.030> don't<00:02:57.030> use<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.690> went<00:02:58.170> with<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the Wi-Fi don't use what I went with the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.650 
the Wi-Fi don't use what I went with the
3g<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.520> know<00:02:59.580> wherever<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.120> am<00:03:00.270> I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
3g just so that you know wherever I am I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.040 
3g just so that you know wherever I am I
