00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
versions of this one as I've got the two

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.610 
versions of this one as I've got the two
color<00:01:20.030> version<00:01:20.360> here<00:01:20.540> which<00:01:20.570> is<00:01:20.840> red<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.320> gold

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
color version here which is red and gold

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.400 
color version here which is red and gold
the<00:01:22.310> second<00:01:22.670> version<00:01:22.820> has<00:01:23.330> purple<00:01:23.990> stickers

the second version has purple stickers
on<00:01:24.530> most<00:01:24.980> of<00:01:25.070> these<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:28.750> these<00:01:29.750> ones

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
on most of these and then these ones

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.540 
on most of these and then these ones
here<00:01:30.140> has<00:01:30.320> got<00:01:30.470> three<00:01:30.740> different<00:01:30.950> colors<00:01:31.430> in

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
here has got three different colors in

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.800 
here has got three different colors in
which<00:01:31.670> gives<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:31.970> more<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.270> guide<00:01:32.480> I<00:01:32.510> think

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
which gives you more of a guide I think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.480 
which gives you more of a guide I think
to<00:01:32.990> where<00:01:33.170> they<00:01:33.320> need<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.530> go<00:01:33.800> where's<00:01:34.370> this

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
to where they need to go where's this

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.890 
to where they need to go where's this
one<00:01:34.640> money<00:01:34.850> scramble<00:01:35.330> you're<00:01:35.540> not<00:01:35.690> going<00:01:35.840> to

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
one money scramble you're not going to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.300 
one money scramble you're not going to
be<00:01:35.960> able<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.140> know<00:01:36.350> which<00:01:36.620> ones<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.220> these

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
be able to know which ones of these

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.610 
be able to know which ones of these
cubes<00:01:37.700> belong<00:01:38.060> where<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.200> can<00:01:42.290> see<00:01:42.440> in<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
cubes belong where so you can see in the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.740 
cubes belong where so you can see in the
first<00:01:42.830> terms<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.400> turns<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.940> strange<00:01:44.360> way<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
first terms it turns in a strange way it

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.650 
first terms it turns in a strange way it
turns<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.080> kind<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.500> offset<00:01:46.220> way<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.760> so

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
turns a kind of offset way like that so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.030 
turns a kind of offset way like that so
straight<00:01:47.930> away<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.140> know<00:01:48.290> it's<00:01:48.320> not<00:01:48.650> just<00:01:48.980> a

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
straight away you know it's not just a

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.210 
straight away you know it's not just a
normal<00:01:49.190> 2<00:01:49.460> by<00:01:49.640> 2<00:01:49.700> which<00:01:50.410> at<00:01:51.410> first<00:01:51.440> glance<00:01:51.770> you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
normal 2 by 2 which at first glance you

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.010 
normal 2 by 2 which at first glance you
might<00:01:52.370> see<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.240> look<00:01:53.510> at<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.720> thing<00:01:53.870> well

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
might see you look at that thing well

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.420 
might see you look at that thing well
how<00:01:54.170> on<00:01:54.290> earth<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.650> possibly<00:01:55.070> separate

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
how on earth can you possibly separate

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.820 
how on earth can you possibly separate
those<00:01:55.610> cubes<00:01:55.970> from<00:01:56.060> each<00:01:56.240> other<00:01:56.450> well<00:01:57.290> what

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
those cubes from each other well what

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.850 
those cubes from each other well what
you<00:01:57.920> ought<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.070> do<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:58.750> my<00:01:59.750> attorney<00:02:00.530> so

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
you ought to do is my attorney so

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.890 
you ought to do is my attorney so
they're<00:02:01.100> all<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.430> cuts<00:02:01.700> line<00:02:02.180> up<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.690> them

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
they're all the cuts line up with them

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.480 
they're all the cuts line up with them
and<00:02:03.170> then<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:04.550> can<00:02:04.760> separate<00:02:05.120> them

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.210 

okay<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.729> turning<00:02:10.090> quality<00:02:10.420> feels<00:02:10.890> fine

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
okay the turning quality feels fine

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.310 
okay the turning quality feels fine
especially<00:02:12.940> on<00:02:13.060> Easter<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:13.990> as<00:02:14.050> soon<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.260> you

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.280 
start trying to move the little two by
two<00:02:17.530> block<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:19.180> gets<00:02:19.330> slightly<00:02:19.750> stiffer

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
two block there it gets slightly stiffer

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.230 
two block there it gets slightly stiffer
it's<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.590> terrible<00:02:21.040> or<00:02:21.160> anything<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.210> a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
heavier than that side it's sort of it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.010 
heavier than that side it's sort of it
which<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.900> feels<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.230> little<00:02:38.350> odd<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:39.900> don't<00:02:40.900> want

which is feels a little odd I don't want

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.240 
which is feels a little odd I don't want

clearly<00:03:10.510> some<00:03:10.780> bandaging<00:03:11.320> going<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.650> with

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
clearly some bandaging going on with

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.820 
clearly some bandaging going on with
this<00:03:11.890> puzzle<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.810> other<00:03:13.810> things<00:03:14.110> as<00:03:14.290> well<00:03:14.470> of

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
this puzzle and other things as well of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.780 
this puzzle and other things as well of
course<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:18.040> don't<00:03:18.280> know<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:18.519> difficult

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
course so I don't know how difficult

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.520 
course so I don't know how difficult
this<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.150> gonna<00:03:19.269> be<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> suspect<00:03:20.140> it's<00:03:20.290> gonna<00:03:20.380> be

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
this is gonna be I suspect it's gonna be

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.259 
this is gonna be I suspect it's gonna be
quite<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.860> difficult<00:03:21.100> puzzle<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.670> solve<00:03:21.910> but<00:03:22.239> I

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
quite a difficult puzzle to solve but I

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.630 
quite a difficult puzzle to solve but I
don't<00:03:22.570> think<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:22.780> gonna<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:23.019> easy<00:03:23.290> at<00:03:23.680> all

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
don't think it's gonna be easy at all

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.400 
don't think it's gonna be easy at all
Bundy's<00:03:25.209> patrols<00:03:25.600> are<00:03:25.780> never<00:03:25.959> easy<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.320> don't

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
Bundy's patrols are never easy I don't

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.580 
Bundy's patrols are never easy I don't
think<00:03:26.739> anyway<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.720> think<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.470> is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
think anyway and so I think this is

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.199 
think anyway and so I think this is
gonna<00:03:29.709> be<00:03:29.799> an<00:03:30.070> interesting<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:31.060> your

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
gonna be an interesting with your

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.920 
gonna be an interesting with your
challenge

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.259 

so<00:03:37.560> yeah<00:03:38.250> I'm<00:03:38.430> very<00:03:38.610> much<00:03:38.700> looking<00:03:38.879> forward<00:03:39.030> to

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
so yeah I'm very much looking forward to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.929 
so yeah I'm very much looking forward to
playing<00:03:39.510> with<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.430> always<00:03:41.640> say

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
playing with this I know I always say

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.160 
playing with this I know I always say
that<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.299> know<00:03:42.360> I<00:03:42.480> always<00:03:42.720> say<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:42.989> I

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
that and I know I always say that I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.160 
that and I know I always say that I
always<00:03:43.349> say<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:44.209> well<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.510> gonna<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
always say that well this is gonna be a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.929 
always say that well this is gonna be a
tough<00:03:46.579> puzzle<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.790> think<00:03:48.590> capture<00:03:49.590> those<00:03:50.549> small

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
tough puzzle I think capture those small

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.050 
tough puzzle I think capture those small
things<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.659> smaller<00:03:51.930> tubes<00:03:52.260> or<00:03:52.379> something

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
things on the smaller tubes or something

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.869 
things on the smaller tubes or something
catching<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.299> bit<00:03:54.569> there

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
catching a little bit there

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.710 
catching a little bit there
probably<00:03:56.879> this<00:03:57.000> needs<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.359> little<00:03:57.480> bit<00:03:57.629> of

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
probably this needs a little bit of

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.809 
probably this needs a little bit of
great<00:03:57.959> feeling

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.190 

so<00:04:02.819> yeah<00:04:02.939> that's<00:04:03.090> excellent<00:04:03.689> put<00:04:03.900> oh<00:04:03.930> I'm<00:04:04.019> very

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so yeah that's excellent put oh I'm very

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.349 
so yeah that's excellent put oh I'm very
happy<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.650> this<00:04:04.799> one<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.879> said<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.180> was

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
happy with this one but I said this was

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.300 
happy with this one but I said this was
the<00:04:06.390> one<00:04:06.629> I<00:04:06.659> was<00:04:06.780> most<00:04:06.840> excited<00:04:07.769> out<00:04:07.920> about

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
the one I was most excited out about

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.460 
the one I was most excited out about
from<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.579> whole<00:04:08.700> order<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:12.170> turning<00:04:13.170> quality

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
from the whole order the turning quality

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.939 
from the whole order the turning quality
we<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.069> said<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:15.120> good<00:04:15.889> you<00:04:16.889> can

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
we and I said this is good you can

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.170 
we and I said this is good you can
definitely<00:04:17.190> feel<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.519> difference<00:04:17.940> between

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
definitely feel the difference between

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.170 
definitely feel the difference between
the<00:04:19.310> small<00:04:20.310> cubes<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.760> big<00:04:20.880> one<00:04:21.030> that's

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
the small cubes and the big one that's

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.029 
the small cubes and the big one that's
definitely<00:04:21.510> an<00:04:21.570> extra<00:04:21.840> stiffness<00:04:22.139> there<00:04:22.590> but

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
definitely an extra stiffness there but

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.810 
definitely an extra stiffness there but
I<00:04:23.100> suspect<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.550> know<00:04:23.669> why<00:04:23.820> that's<00:04:23.970> ease<00:04:24.180> as<00:04:24.300> well

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
I suspect I know why that's ease as well

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
I suspect I know why that's ease as well
well<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.940> don't<00:04:27.240> think<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.449> need<00:04:27.600> any

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
well I don't think you need any

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.510 
well I don't think you need any
lubrication<00:04:28.410> or<00:04:28.710> anything<00:04:28.860> like<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.310> turns

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
lubrication or anything like it turns

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.600 
lubrication or anything like it turns
quite<00:04:29.820> well<00:04:33.380> otherwise<00:04:34.380> so<00:04:35.220> yeah<00:04:35.430> I'm<00:04:35.580> very

happy with this one shall I go ahead and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.750 
happy with this one shall I go ahead and
scramble<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.250> one<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:40.560> think<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.610> probably

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
scramble this one I think I probably

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
scramble this one I think I probably
will<00:04:43.460> since<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.820> pretty<00:04:45.419> much<00:04:45.539> what<00:04:45.750> I

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
will since that is pretty much what I

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.610 
will since that is pretty much what I
always<00:04:46.020> do<00:04:46.320> these<00:04:46.530> days<00:04:46.830> so<00:04:47.099> yeah<00:04:47.610> let's<00:04:47.970> see

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
always do these days so yeah let's see

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.050 
always do these days so yeah let's see
okay<00:04:49.620> everything<00:04:49.979> line<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.280> thinking<00:04:50.490> split

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
okay everything line of thinking split

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.290 
okay everything line of thinking split
up<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> TVs<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.760> see<00:04:53.760> where<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.120> go<00:04:54.150> from

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
up the TVs and see where we go from

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.409 
up the TVs and see where we go from
there<00:04:58.400> yeah<00:04:59.400> this<00:04:59.580> is<00:04:59.699> tough<00:04:59.909> even<00:05:00.090> just

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
there yeah this is tough even just

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:01.399 
there yeah this is tough even just
Graham<00:05:00.690> oh<00:05:00.840> never<00:05:01.020> mind

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409

Graham oh never mind
Oh<00:05:02.330> accidentally<00:05:03.330> sold<00:05:03.539> everything<00:05:03.930> again

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.470 

this<00:05:13.920> really<00:05:14.130> is<00:05:14.580> challenging<00:05:15.120> even<00:05:15.210> to

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
this really is challenging even to

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.240 
this really is challenging even to
scramble<00:05:15.930> this<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.470> much<00:05:16.620> fun<00:05:16.860> do<00:05:17.040> you<00:05:17.070> know

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250

funding on it Palladino gonna have a
hard<00:05:20.130> time<00:05:20.610> solving<00:05:21.030> this<00:05:21.360> one<00:05:21.540> for<00:05:21.720> sure<00:05:23.900> I'm

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
hard time solving this one for sure I'm

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.030 
hard time solving this one for sure I'm
not<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.080> best<00:05:25.410> at<00:05:26.330> solving<00:05:27.330> baddest<00:05:28.080> portals

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
not the best at solving baddest portals

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.820 
not the best at solving baddest portals
anyway<00:05:29.700> I<00:05:30.540> like<00:05:31.020> some<00:05:31.170> of<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.350> simpler<00:05:31.650> ones

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
anyway I like some of the simpler ones

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.170 
anyway I like some of the simpler ones
like<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:34.680> ones<00:05:34.860> that<00:05:35.130> twist<00:05:35.880> must

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
