 the senator 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.759
 in the fourth chain you will introduce a tree that will make a high point in the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.450
 hand 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.019
 she insures 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.480
 in the next race where you will now enter again 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.719
 the high point of the advice 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.719
 in the same chain another high point 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.960
 or in every chain of this we did 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.890
 you will work two high points inside it 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.370
 this will already be the base of our scarf 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.940
 You may be using a light bulb. 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.390
 we are now having wonderful results. 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.180
 he looks good like the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 who comes from the first career there was series d he already became the sister 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.420
 to go back to second career we have two points on each continent 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.400
 now we're going to make three clients up 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.290
 she is a woman 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 inserts needle in the first space 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.030
 then make a high point we have two high points a chain by the stork 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.270
 in the next high point what is it that the two that stayed in the last chain 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.840
 let's just make it a high point 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.280
 in a chain she is a woman 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.540
 let's pro next point 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.960
 where are we going to do at high point 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.930
 a chain by the second in the same place a high point 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.739
 an accountant was born gurrÃ­a 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.919
 on the front dorset 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.919
 we'll just put one high point 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.449
 there occurs to be titled goliath next point 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.799
 Similarly 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.620
 in the author's point with a chain there ran in the same place 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.279
 a high point 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.599
 in a chain 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.889
 in the second we have a calf in the first point 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.079
 on the next point 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.199
 we are going to make only one high point 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.829
 they will stay then 9 March 5 which were two points in each stream 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.829
 in the above career will be three points such 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.609
 the second career is ready 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.169
 he goes 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.289
 involving more and will increase on the sides 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.169
 now let's start third career 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.079
 two 3 four chains 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:12.509
 we have the first chain is that divided the two high points of the last you 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.389
 will learn this act 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.259
 in interlagos did not score 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:19.550
 not for two three 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.550
 four chains in the next pakistan 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:25.009
 Similarly 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.039
 we are going to work on current arcs now 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.679
 you're going to make the bow with four chains and we're going to attach this bow 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:38.769
 between each chain that has divided the high points of the previous career 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.049
 four chains 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.069
 entered needle at its point where we made a current by dividing the points 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.339
 from the base we'll hold the air like these chains 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.259
 it's getting this way 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.179
 continue the world 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.279
 four chains 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.269
 hold on next states 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.719
 that is 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:08.309
 we will always work in contact with neighbors and we will arrest in which all 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:12.129
 the spaces do not let pass any space to not be nervous 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.719
 four upcoming matches 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.109
 he'll be fine 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.169
 balardin london these chains 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.169
 being very crooked 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.469
 4 continents 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.419
 our space 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.330
 he is staying above 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.789
 we finish the third race, notice that it looks like a flower 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.460
 hence withdrawing money 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.350
 let's start in the fourth and last career in the same way in the third part 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.080
 of the trader you will introduce needle taking the first bow 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.759
 then make a new arc in the fourth row 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.939
 four chains 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.939
 to move in with 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.009
 four chains to live in 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.759
 now we're going to work like this until the end of our earth says 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.259
 in the sequel holding us 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.259
 in the arc of the third 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.020
 it gets very beautiful and effective action
