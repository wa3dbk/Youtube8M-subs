find<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:07.080> for<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.040> reason<00:01:08.369> they

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
find to it is for some reason they

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
find to it is for some reason they
decided<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.880> design<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> bottle

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
decided to design it where the bottle

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
decided to design it where the bottle
will<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.830> fit<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.729> otherwise<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
will not fit in there otherwise the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
will not fit in there otherwise the
