00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
you wear it's essentially the same thing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.130 
you wear it's essentially the same thing
but<00:01:53.180> it's<00:01:53.330> not<00:01:53.390> going<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.690> be<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:53.900> your<00:01:53.990> way

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
want a brace that's constantly there in

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.370 
want a brace that's constantly there in
your<00:02:02.600> way<00:02:02.720> where<00:02:02.960> your<00:02:03.050> head<00:02:03.170> might<00:02:03.350> be

bumping<00:02:03.800> into<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.460> airbag<00:02:04.820> vest<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.540> a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
bumping into it the airbag vest is a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.350 
bumping into it the airbag vest is a
good<00:02:05.810> option<00:02:06.230> as<00:02:06.380> an<00:02:07.130> alternative<00:02:07.640> basically

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
good option as an alternative basically

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.690 
good option as an alternative basically
what<00:02:08.450> it's<00:02:08.569> going<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.140> if<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.399> crash

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
what it's going to do is if you crash

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.509 
what it's going to do is if you crash
this<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.750> going<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.260> pull<00:02:12.620> off<00:02:12.860> of<00:02:13.220> your<00:02:13.370> bike

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
this is going to pull off of your bike

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.880 
this is going to pull off of your bike
which<00:02:14.510> will<00:02:14.660> inflate<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.140> airbag<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.650> point

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
which will inflate the airbag in point

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.770 
which will inflate the airbag in point
two<00:02:16.040> seconds<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:16.970> what's<00:02:17.120> neat<00:02:17.300> about<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.659> is

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
two seconds but what's neat about it is

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.710 
two seconds but what's neat about it is
that<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.590> pull<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.340> by<00:02:20.090> accident<00:02:20.599> like

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
that if you pull it by accident like

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.690 
that if you pull it by accident like
just<00:02:21.110> getting<00:02:21.319> off<00:02:21.409> the<00:02:21.560> bike<00:02:21.739> it's<00:02:22.280> not<00:02:22.489> going

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
just getting off the bike it's not going

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.920 
just getting off the bike it's not going
to<00:02:22.819> inflate<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.300> if<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> pull<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.629> really

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
to inflate but if you pull it really

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.360 
to inflate but if you pull it really
hard<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.409> in<00:02:25.099> a<00:02:25.220> crash

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
hard as in a crash

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.850 
hard as in a crash
in<00:02:28.370> plates<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:31.690> basically<00:02:32.690> that's<00:02:33.290> going<00:02:33.500> to

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
in plates so basically that's going to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.800 
in plates so basically that's going to
seal<00:02:34.310> up<00:02:34.490> around<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.600> stays

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
seal up around and you can see it stays

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.500 
seal up around and you can see it stays
really<00:02:36.260> rigid<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.400> as<00:02:37.670> you're<00:02:38.000> tumbling<00:02:38.180> and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
really rigid so as you're tumbling and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.120 
really rigid so as you're tumbling and
crashing<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:39.020> going<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.350> hold<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.830> remember

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
crashing it's going to hold and remember

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.500 
crashing it's going to hold and remember
Graham's<00:02:40.310> going<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.520> be<00:02:40.580> wearing<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.850> helmet<00:02:41.000> so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
Graham's going to be wearing a helmet so

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.980 
Graham's going to be wearing a helmet so
it's<00:02:41.630> really<00:02:41.840> going<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.200> limit<00:02:42.410> how<00:02:42.650> much<00:02:43.160> is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
it's really going to limit how much is

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.720 
it's really going to limit how much is
how<00:02:44.990> much<00:02:45.110> movement<00:02:45.290> his<00:02:45.680> neck<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.190> have<00:02:46.370> so

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
how much movement his neck can have so

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.850 
how much movement his neck can have so
if<00:02:46.820> he<00:02:46.940> hits<00:02:47.120> his<00:02:47.180> head<00:02:47.270> his<00:02:47.840> neck<00:02:48.110> can't<00:02:48.440> be

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
if he hits his head his neck can't be

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
if he hits his head his neck can't be
wrenched<00:02:49.340> forward<00:02:49.730> or<00:02:49.850> backwards<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.450> is

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
wrenched forward or backwards and is

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.260 
wrenched forward or backwards and is
going<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.110> keep<00:02:51.290> him<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:52.010> much<00:02:52.220> safer<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
going to keep him that much safer the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.670 
going to keep him that much safer the
other<00:02:53.390> thing<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.810> did<00:02:53.870> want<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.260> point<00:02:54.530> out
