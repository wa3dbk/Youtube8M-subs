00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.569
 under the agreement disney will acquire the property of five thousand characters of 

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:21.800
 marvel 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 the analyst David Coetzee 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.349
 said the acquisition will help disney attract young people 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.829
 they have gone to the movie theaters to see the marvel superheroes in years 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:33.880
 recent 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.010
 that contrasts with recent disney successes and among young girls who 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 include hannah montana and the jonas 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.850
 hear exposure to a population of young males with whom he had 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.300
 lost some balance 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.830
 said john isner my main concern is that my patients still 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.430
 underlining that the offer of 4 billion dollars in the unc 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 the director of disney 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.790
 combines the strong global position of marvel and its portfolio of characters 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.970
 known worldwide with the incomparable world portfolio of centers 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.750
 of Disney entertainment and with it its ability to increase 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750
 to maximize the value in multiple platforms and territory 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800
 employees of marvel review 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.360
 so far not all in Madrid had confirmed the purchase that will make Disney 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.790
 why added to the teasing of some fans on twitter and challenged employees like 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.050
 illustrators codie young 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.850
 in his profile on twitter young lamented the past he was made 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.780
 I am very happy today 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.499
 but I hope that either tomorrow and the lousy jokes about disney go 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 inter creates comedy rushed and cheap bad jokes 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.520
 but the writer and so big preferred to take justice in a way 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.810
 more relaxed 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.810
 my main concern is that mystic and saul 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.570
 that was my first question in this way 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.130
 he answered cheste according to sky editor 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.330
 it was comic giant who said that for now they only have 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310
 general meetings 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.069
 specified still 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.239
 shares marvel shareholders will receive 30 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.729
 cash per share plus 0 comma 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.169
 35 Disney shares for each 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.929
 the marvel they have 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.699
 disney and marvel directives approved 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.699
 with the transaction but that requires a network 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.069
 since the approval of the shareholders of 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.019
 and if this is the bad news I shit on disney can ruin the best 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.299
 comics like him 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.049
 and the x men among many others
