00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.000 
you how to do some pushing resistance
training<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> slackline<00:00:05.750> I<00:00:06.890> just<00:00:07.890> showed

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
training with a slackline I just showed

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.850 
training with a slackline I just showed
you<00:00:08.160> how<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.730> some<00:00:09.210> pulling<00:00:09.719> exercises<00:00:10.469> so

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
you how to do some pulling exercises so

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.310 
you how to do some pulling exercises so
the<00:00:11.040> next<00:00:11.190> logical<00:00:11.509> position<00:00:12.509> would<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.170> go

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
the next logical position would be to go

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.180 
the next logical position would be to go
from<00:00:13.500> here<00:00:13.769> or<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:14.700> here<00:00:15.710> to<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> lower

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
from here or here or here to a lower

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.960 
from here or here or here to a lower
position<00:00:17.520> or<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.330> front<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:19.170> high<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.130> when

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
position or in front or high so when

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.040 
position or in front or high so when
it's<00:00:21.090> low<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.470> do<00:00:22.619> push-ups<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:27.050> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
it's low I like to do push-ups and a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290 
it's low I like to do push-ups and a
push-up<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> thing<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:29.970> your<00:00:30.000> waist

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
push-up with the thing at your waist

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.740 
push-up with the thing at your waist
would<00:00:30.510> work<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.960> lower<00:00:31.199> part<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:31.949> chest

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
would work the lower part of your chest

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.510 
would work the lower part of your chest
and<00:00:33.750> further<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.500> front<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.980> would<00:00:35.340> work

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and further in front of you would work

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
and further in front of you would work
the<00:00:35.790> upper<00:00:35.820> part<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.420> chest<00:00:36.690> near<00:00:36.960> your

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the upper part of your chest near your

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.580 
the upper part of your chest near your
shoulders<00:00:37.610> wide<00:00:38.610> grips<00:00:39.090> tend<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.200> work<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
shoulders wide grips tend to work the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
shoulders wide grips tend to work the
wider<00:00:40.800> part<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.340> chest<00:00:41.550> narrower<00:00:42.030> grips

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
wider part of your chest narrower grips

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
wider part of your chest narrower grips
the<00:00:42.780> middle<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.980> really<00:00:44.219> move<00:00:44.430> your

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the middle so you can really move your

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
the middle so you can really move your
hands<00:00:44.850> around<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.300> lot<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.059> even<00:00:48.120> start<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
hands around a lot you can even start to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.709 
hands around a lot you can even start to
work<00:00:48.840> areas<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:51.539> your

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
work areas in your back if you put your

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.369 
work areas in your back if you put your
head<00:00:54.289> underneath<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.879> push<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
head underneath and push up that way so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.069 
head underneath and push up that way so
some<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.770> these<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.180> kind<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.300> advanced<00:01:00.809> moves

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
some of these are kind of advanced moves

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.789 
some of these are kind of advanced moves
but<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:03.300> start<00:01:03.809> slow<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.559> anything

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
but you know start slow like in anything

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.670 
but you know start slow like in anything
but<00:01:06.290> do<00:01:07.290> push-ups<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.470> some

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
but do push-ups and then you can do some

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.179 
but do push-ups and then you can do some
pushing<00:01:11.659> forward<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> line<00:01:13.080> again<00:01:13.619> for

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
pushing forward on the line again for

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
pushing forward on the line again for
chest<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:14.939> starts<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> incorporate

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
chest but it also starts to incorporate

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
chest but it also starts to incorporate
your<00:01:16.080> legs<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
your legs a little bit and to get the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
your legs a little bit and to get the
range<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> motion<00:01:21.299> again<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
range of motion again you just need to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
range of motion again you just need to
keep<00:01:22.470> moving<00:01:22.710> your<00:01:23.159> feet<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.240> close<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
keep moving your feet so close to the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
keep moving your feet so close to the
line<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:26.159> be<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.970> close<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> get

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
line would be up close and then to get

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.429 
line would be up close and then to get
the<00:01:30.210> full<00:01:30.360> range<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.689> motion<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.170> start

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the full range of motion just start

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.550 
the full range of motion just start
moving<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:32.009> further<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> further<00:01:33.180> away

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
moving back further and further away

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.410 
moving back further and further away
until<00:01:34.560> you've<00:01:34.770> locked<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.460> elbows<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:37.130> now

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
until you've locked your elbows out now

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.219 
until you've locked your elbows out now
to<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> squat<00:01:40.170> pushing<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> line

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
to get a squat pushing up on the line

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.370 
to get a squat pushing up on the line
tighten<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:45.170> maybe<00:01:46.170> not

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
tighten it up a little bit maybe not

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.770 
tighten it up a little bit maybe not
enough<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.880> range<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.270> motion<00:01:51.420> is

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
enough and the range of motion is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.880 
enough and the range of motion is
difficult<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.180> because

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
difficult to get with this one because

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.209 
difficult to get with this one because
the<00:01:55.890> line<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.340> only<00:01:56.549> give<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.149> much<00:01:58.070> or<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the line will only give so much or you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.649 
the line will only give so much or you
can<00:01:59.399> get<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.759> under<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:02.390> just<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.540> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can get right under it just like you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.620 
can get right under it just like you
would<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> gym<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> do<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> squat<00:02:04.799> or<00:02:05.630> calf

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
would in the gym to do a squat or calf

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.710 
would in the gym to do a squat or calf
raises

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
raises

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.580 
raises
on<00:02:08.110> your<00:02:08.290> toes<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:10.540> if<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.869> want<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.170> get<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
lower range of motion out of it like you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.460 
lower range of motion out of it like you
want<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.210> get<00:02:16.360> hard<00:02:16.780> here<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.290> move

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
want it to get hard here just move

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.330 
want it to get hard here just move
closer<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.190> fixed<00:02:18.550> point<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.740> push<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.190> on

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
closer to the fixed point so push up on

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.500 
closer to the fixed point so push up on
a<00:02:21.400> squat<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:22.030> way<00:02:25.590> lock<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.770> out<00:02:27.450> down<00:02:28.450> a

a squat that way lock it out down a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.090 
a squat that way lock it out down a
little<00:02:28.690> lower<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:32.700> as<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.420> moving<00:02:35.100> you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
little lower and as this is moving you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.430 
little lower and as this is moving you
can<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.840> there's<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.930> lot<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.140> core

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
can see that there's a lot of core

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.830 
can see that there's a lot of core
strength<00:02:38.680> involved<00:02:39.310> with<00:02:40.440> bouncy<00:02:41.440> resistant

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
strength involved with bouncy resistant

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.340 
strength involved with bouncy resistant
so<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.050> pretty<00:02:44.260> effective<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:47.020> we've<00:02:47.170> done

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
so it's pretty effective so we've done

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
so it's pretty effective so we've done
some<00:02:47.590> legs<00:02:48.250> or<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:49.450> obviously<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:51.160> can

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
some legs or this and obviously you can

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.020 
some legs or this and obviously you can
get<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.550> little<00:02:51.790> bit<00:02:51.880> lower<00:02:53.640> push<00:02:54.640> up<00:02:54.820> with<00:02:54.970> your

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
get a little bit lower push up with your

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.080 
get a little bit lower push up with your
shoulders<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:56.440> again<00:02:56.709> range<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.130> motion<00:02:57.520> you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
shoulders and again range of motion you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.390 
shoulders and again range of motion you
just<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.420> move<00:02:58.690> away<00:02:59.010> away<00:03:00.010> from<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
just have to move away away from the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.160 
just have to move away away from the
line

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.040 

so

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
so

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.190 
so
I<00:03:08.140> guess<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.920> rule<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.220> just<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.550> think<00:03:09.790> of<00:03:10.200> all

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I guess the rule is just to think of all

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.530 
I guess the rule is just to think of all
the<00:03:11.590> different<00:03:11.890> ways<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.540> push

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
the different ways that you can push

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.110 
the different ways that you can push
away<00:03:14.320> from<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:16.890> each<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:17.950> valid<00:03:18.490> I<00:03:18.670> guess

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
away from it and each is valid I guess

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.980 
away from it and each is valid I guess
so<00:03:19.650> those<00:03:20.650> are<00:03:20.680> some<00:03:20.860> pushing<00:03:21.310> ideas<00:03:22.060> for

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
so those are some pushing ideas for

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.760 
so those are some pushing ideas for
strength<00:03:23.800> training<00:03:23.920> with<00:03:24.460> a<00:03:24.490> slackline
