00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
and that should actually be good for our

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.520 
and that should actually be good for our
roof<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:07.090> then<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.269> yeah<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.660> then<00:04:08.810> we<00:04:09.380> also

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
roof and then so yeah and then we also

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.410 
roof and then so yeah and then we also
built<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:09.920> next<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.220> water<00:04:10.400> for<00:04:10.640> one<00:04:10.820> key

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
built it next to water for one key

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.390 
built it next to water for one key
reason<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.350> can<00:04:12.560> build<00:04:12.769> kind<00:04:12.980> of<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.130> moat

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
reason so you can build kind of a moat

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.640 
reason so you can build kind of a moat
around<00:04:13.549> your<00:04:13.850> house<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.540> if<00:04:14.720> something<00:04:15.500> tries

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
around your house so if something tries

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.590 
around your house so if something tries
to<00:04:15.799> get<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.040> they're<00:04:16.760> not<00:04:16.790> going<00:04:17.090> to<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.359> be

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
to get in they're not going to really be

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.659 
to get in they're not going to really be
able<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.810> because<00:04:18.590> there's<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.310> moat<00:04:19.549> around

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
able to because there's a moat around

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.150 
able to because there's a moat around
your<00:04:19.970> house<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.560> doing<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:21.770> we're<00:04:22.039> also

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160

it's just a party now luckily we spawned
next<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.050> some<00:05:03.200> gravel<00:05:03.620> which<00:05:03.980> is<00:05:04.190> always<00:05:04.340> a

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
next to some gravel which is always a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.850 
next to some gravel which is always a
great<00:05:04.640> find<00:05:05.000> because<00:05:05.420> gravel<00:05:05.990> also<00:05:06.320> falls<00:05:06.590> and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
great find because gravel also falls and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.320 
great find because gravel also falls and
it's<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.280> lot<00:05:07.400> more<00:05:07.550> common<00:05:07.820> than<00:05:08.000> sand

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
it's a lot more common than sand
