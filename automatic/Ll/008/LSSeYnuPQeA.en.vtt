can have different effects on on ball
flies<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> contact<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.079> see

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
flies and a contact now I like to see

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.979 
flies and a contact now I like to see
personally<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> ball

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
personally I like to see the ball

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.930 
personally I like to see the ball
position<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> left<00:00:44.219> side<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> chest

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
position on the left side of the chest

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.049 
position on the left side of the chest
and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.410> need<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> adjust<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and then all we need to do is adjust the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
and then all we need to do is adjust the
width<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.750> stance<00:00:48.989> okay

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
width of the stance okay

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.150 
width of the stance okay
depending<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> iron<00:00:51.270> we've<00:00:51.420> got<00:00:51.660> now

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
depending on the iron we've got now

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
depending on the iron we've got now
although<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.850> would<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.239> my<00:00:54.480> ideal<00:00:54.930> ball

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
although that would be my ideal ball

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.920 
although that would be my ideal ball
position<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> very<00:00:57.000> simple<00:00:57.510> way<00:00:57.660> then

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
position and it's a very simple way then

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
position and it's a very simple way then
to<00:00:58.140> sort<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.829> replicate<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.520> with<00:00:59.670> each

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to sort of to replicate it with each

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.139 
to sort of to replicate it with each
iron<00:01:00.859> there's<00:01:01.859> no<00:01:02.070> sort<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.520> there's<00:01:02.760> no<00:01:02.879> sort

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
iron there's no sort of there's no sort

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.399 
iron there's no sort of there's no sort
of<00:01:03.210> set<00:01:03.390> rule<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.840> needs<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.260> there

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
of set rule that it needs to be there

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.219 
of set rule that it needs to be there
because<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.799> very<00:01:04.979> much<00:01:05.280> based<00:01:05.580> on

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
because it's very much based on

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.710 
because it's very much based on
individual<00:01:07.229> preference<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.860> also<00:01:08.729> depending

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
individual preference and also depending

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
individual preference and also depending
on<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.200> generating<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.640> impact

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
on what you're generating and impact

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
on what you're generating and impact
with<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.570> golf<00:01:12.750> club<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.920> instance

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
with the golf club so for instance

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.310 
with the golf club so for instance
you'll<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> majority<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> guys<00:01:15.720> on

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you'll see the majority of the guys on

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
you'll see the majority of the guys on
tour<00:01:16.680> trying<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> tuck<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> top<00:01:17.909> guys<00:01:18.180> will

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
tour trying to tuck the top guys will

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
tour trying to tuck the top guys will
have<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> ball<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.140> forward<00:01:19.619> than<00:01:19.770> back

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
have the ball more forward than back

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.460 
have the ball more forward than back
okay<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:21.030> because<00:01:21.360> they're<00:01:21.570> generating<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
okay that's because they're generating a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
okay that's because they're generating a
great<00:01:23.040> lag<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> great<00:01:23.909> weight<00:01:24.240> shift<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
great lag of great weight shift in the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
great lag of great weight shift in the
golf<00:01:24.960> swing<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> lot<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> people<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
golf swing but a lot of the people the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
golf swing but a lot of the people the
average<00:01:27.150> golf<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.720> weekend<00:01:28.200> they're

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
average golf on the weekend they're

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.249 
average golf on the weekend they're
struggling<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.369> things<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:31.020> can't

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
struggling with these things so we can't

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
struggling with these things so we can't
say<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.460> average<00:01:32.579> 25<00:01:33.180> handicapper

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
say that the average 25 handicapper

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.950 
say that the average 25 handicapper
should<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> same<00:01:35.159> position<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.960> Lee

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
should have the same position as Lee

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.990 
should have the same position as Lee
Westwood<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.619> Tiger<00:01:38.220> Woods<00:01:38.400> because<00:01:38.640> they're

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
Westwood or Tiger Woods because they're

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.310 
Westwood or Tiger Woods because they're
they're<00:01:39.180> creating<00:01:39.540> different<00:01:39.840> dynamics<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
they're creating different dynamics in

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.230 
they're creating different dynamics in
the<00:01:40.409> golf<00:01:40.619> swing<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.700> great<00:01:41.939> way<00:01:42.210> for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the golf swing but it's a great way for

you to have a guide of where it should
be<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> work<00:01:45.180> towards<00:01:45.659> now<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.770> water<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.729> say

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
be in work towards now a water would say

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.960 
be in work towards now a water would say
is<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.329> yes<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> great<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
is that yes this is a great way to to
think<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> needs<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.530> practiced

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
think of it but it needs to be practiced

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.200 
think of it but it needs to be practiced
so<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.340> I've<00:01:53.430> got<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.759> ground<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.149> is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so what I've got on the ground here is

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600 
so what I've got on the ground here is
I've<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.479> shaft<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.680> help<00:01:55.860> me<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.369> ball

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I've got a shaft to help me with my ball

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.679 
I've got a shaft to help me with my ball
position<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.210> does<00:01:57.360> need<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.570> be

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
position and it does need to be

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.289 
position and it does need to be
practiced<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.820> what<00:01:59.820> I'm<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.210> is

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
practiced and what I'm going to do is

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
practiced and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:00.390> gonna<00:02:00.509> set<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.960> exactly<00:02:01.439> where<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.979> feel

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
I'm gonna set it up exactly where I feel

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.090 
I'm gonna set it up exactly where I feel
comfortable<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:03.119> terms<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.869> left<00:02:04.680> side<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
comfortable in terms of left side of the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.130 
comfortable in terms of left side of the
chest<00:02:05.310> okay<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.630> feel<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
chest okay so now it's I feel it in a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.540 
chest okay so now it's I feel it in a
great<00:02:07.350> position<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.039> comfortable

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
great position and that's comfortable

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.930 
great position and that's comfortable
for<00:02:08.819> me<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:10.289> if<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:11.039> somebody<00:02:11.340> who<00:02:11.670> tends

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
for me now if you're somebody who tends

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800 
for me now if you're somebody who tends
to<00:02:12.090> hit<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> ground<00:02:12.540> for

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
to hit the ground for

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.890 
to hit the ground for
first<00:02:12.959> then<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.790> may<00:02:14.970> move<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.209> ball<00:02:15.510> position

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
first then we may move the ball position

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.809 
first then we may move the ball position
back<00:02:16.080> okay<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.280> bottom<00:02:17.700> of

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
back okay because your your bottom of

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.930 
back okay because your your bottom of
the<00:02:17.910> golf<00:02:18.120> swing<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.890> too<00:02:19.890> early<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.489> again<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
the golf swing is too early so again it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.339 
the golf swing is too early so again it
all<00:02:21.150> depends<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.569> how<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.810> creating<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
all depends on how you creating that

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.680 
all depends on how you creating that
strike<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:22.800> well<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.640> what<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.120> will<00:02:24.239> find<00:02:24.450> is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
strike as well but what you will find is

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.900 
strike as well but what you will find is
if<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.989> go<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.410> general<00:02:25.770> rule<00:02:26.010> left

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
if you go with the general rule left

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.839 
if you go with the general rule left
side<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.360> chest<00:02:28.310> adjust<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.459> width<00:02:29.640> of

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
side of the chest adjust the width of

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.059 
side of the chest adjust the width of
the<00:02:29.940> stance<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:31.050> may<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.260> may<00:02:31.650> going<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the stance it may be may going to

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.199 
the stance it may be may going to
further<00:02:32.190> fall<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.580> make<00:02:32.790> them<00:02:32.970> an<00:02:33.060> inch

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
further fall you make them an inch

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.910 
further fall you make them an inch
further<00:02:33.390> back<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.440> great<00:02:34.709> way<00:02:34.890> for

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
further back but it's a great way for

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.680 
further back but it's a great way for
you<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.220> replicate<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.090> without<00:02:36.450> getting

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
you to replicate it without getting

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.990 
you to replicate it without getting
confused<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.620> trying<00:02:38.340> all<00:02:38.610> sorts<00:02:38.940> of

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
confused and trying all sorts of

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.970 
confused and trying all sorts of
different<00:02:39.180> ball<00:02:39.510> positions<00:02:40.050> with<00:02:40.650> different

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
different ball positions with different

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.339 
different ball positions with different
golf<00:02:41.099> clubs<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:42.030> said<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.599> have<00:02:42.810> what

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
golf clubs as I said that can have what

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.320 
golf clubs as I said that can have what
a<00:02:43.380> damaging<00:02:43.800> effect<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.580> contact<00:02:45.060> but

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
a damaging effect on the contact but

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.030 
a damaging effect on the contact but
also<00:02:45.480> direction<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> ball<00:02:46.769> position

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
also direction because the ball position

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.430 
also direction because the ball position
does<00:02:47.430> influence<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.480> direction<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:49.080> got<00:02:49.230> more

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
does influence the direction we got more

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.970 
does influence the direction we got more
as<00:02:49.590> well

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
as well

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.640 
as well
so<00:02:50.459> what<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.480> would<00:02:51.630> say<00:02:51.780> guys<00:02:52.019> on<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.470> range

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
so what I would say guys on the range

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.580 
so what I would say guys on the range
set<00:02:53.040> yourself<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.549> with<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.850> shaft<00:02:54.440> get<00:02:55.440> it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
set yourself up with the shaft get it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.949 
set yourself up with the shaft get it
slightly<00:02:56.010> closer<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.239> front<00:02:57.510> foot<00:02:57.690> as<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
slightly closer to the front foot as I

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.690 
slightly closer to the front foot as I
say<00:02:58.290> slightly<00:02:58.709> left<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> center<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
say slightly left of the center of the

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.030 
say slightly left of the center of the
chest<00:02:59.910> there<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.450> work<00:03:01.319> on<00:03:01.560> your<00:03:01.799> ball

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
chest there and work on your ball

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.280 
chest there and work on your ball
position<00:03:02.069> just<00:03:03.000> feeling<00:03:03.330> comfortable<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
position just feeling comfortable the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.780 
position just feeling comfortable the
more<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.190> you'll<00:03:05.340> find<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
more you do it the more you'll find the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.370 
more you do it the more you'll find the
ideal<00:03:06.090> position<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.900> well<00:03:07.049> it<00:03:07.170> may<00:03:07.319> be

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
ideal position for you is well it may be

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.289 
ideal position for you is well it may be
an<00:03:07.530> inch<00:03:07.680> further<00:03:07.799> forward<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.340> said<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:09.060> may

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
an inch further forward as I said it may

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.789 
an inch further forward as I said it may
be<00:03:09.360> an<00:03:09.540> inch<00:03:09.690> back<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.140> at<00:03:10.230> least<00:03:10.410> then<00:03:10.680> you

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
be an inch back but at least then you

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.860 
be an inch back but at least then you
can<00:03:10.950> replicate<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.880> keep<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.690> same

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
can replicate it and keep it the same

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.080 
can replicate it and keep it the same
each<00:03:13.049> time<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.530> let's<00:03:13.950> hit<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.130> shot<00:03:14.310> from<00:03:14.940> where

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
each time so let's hit a shot from where

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.300 
each time so let's hit a shot from where
my<00:03:15.299> ball<00:03:15.540> position<00:03:15.930> would<00:03:16.049> be<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.190> give

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
my ball position would be just to give

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.190 
my ball position would be just to give
you<00:03:17.400> an<00:03:17.489> idea<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.810> up<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.049> pollow
