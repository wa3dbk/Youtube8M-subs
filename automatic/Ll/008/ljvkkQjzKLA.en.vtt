2013 redesign and I think that was smart
that's<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.559> my<00:00:37.710> favorite<00:00:38.129> features<00:00:38.280> right

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
side of the head phones and they charge

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.250 
side of the head phones and they charge
rarely<00:01:04.710> rather<00:01:05.309> quickly<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.270> don't<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
rarely rather quickly I don't have a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
rarely rather quickly I don't have a
whole<00:01:07.439> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> issue<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.000> speed<00:01:09.240> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
whole lot of issue with the speed in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840 
whole lot of issue with the speed in
which<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.659> charge<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.670> overall<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> think

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
which they charge and overall I think

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
which they charge and overall I think
it's<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.330> awesome<00:01:12.450> system<00:01:13.250> when<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.280> talk

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it's an awesome system when you talk

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's an awesome system when you talk
about<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.909> case<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.720> hard<00:01:15.990> case

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
about this case I think this hard case

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.249 
about this case I think this hard case
works<00:01:16.439> fairly<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.880> wish<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:19.020> had

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
works fairly well I wish to this had

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
works fairly well I wish to this had
been<00:01:19.470> stitched<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> premium<00:01:20.580> product

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
been stitched as a premium product

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
been stitched as a premium product
because<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> three-hundred-dollar

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
because this is a three-hundred-dollar

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.359 
because this is a three-hundred-dollar
headset<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> sticker<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
headset but it is a sticker but it's a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.950 
headset but it is a sticker but it's a
nice<00:01:26.520> sticker<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.119> still<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> sticker<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
nice sticker but it still is a sticker I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.480 
nice sticker but it still is a sticker I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
would like to have had that stitched and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.319 
would like to have had that stitched and
I<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.900> other<00:01:31.110> gripe<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.920> case

this<00:02:56.160> overall<00:02:56.550> design<00:02:57.180> particularly<00:02:57.720> on<00:02:58.020> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
this overall design particularly on the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.920 
this overall design particularly on the
black<00:02:58.650> ones<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:59.820> thing<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.150> mention<00:03:00.300> is

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
black ones one thing I will mention is

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.080 
black ones one thing I will mention is
that<00:03:00.959> as<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.739> can<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:03.030> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
that as you can see here they do get a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.960 
that as you can see here they do get a
lot<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.360> fingerprints<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.680> huge<00:03:05.220> deal<00:03:05.700> for

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
lot of fingerprints not a huge deal for

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.350 
lot of fingerprints not a huge deal for
me<00:03:06.150> because<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.720> generally<00:03:07.590> carry<00:03:07.890> a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
me because I generally carry a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.300 
me because I generally carry a
microfiber<00:03:09.360> cloth<00:03:09.540> around<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.920> wipe<00:03:11.130> them

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
microfiber cloth around and I wipe them

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.550 
microfiber cloth around and I wipe them
off<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.670> keep<00:03:11.940> going<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.200> some<00:03:13.380> people

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
off and keep going but for some people

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.310 
off and keep going but for some people
that<00:03:13.770> may<00:03:14.100> be<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.310> big<00:03:14.580> deal<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:14.850> they<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:15.989> a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
that may be a big deal so they do have a

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.860 
that may be a big deal so they do have a
blue<00:03:16.769> white<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.070> blue<00:03:18.000> white<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.239> red<00:03:18.450> right

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
blue white and blue white and red right

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.460 
blue white and blue white and red right
now<00:03:18.900> also<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.310> my<00:03:20.489> opinion<00:03:20.549> these<00:03:21.030> are<00:03:21.470> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
now also but in my opinion these are the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.680 
now also but in my opinion these are the
the<00:03:22.980> best<00:03:23.190> looking<00:03:23.400> ones<00:03:23.790> cuz<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.360> can<00:03:24.540> win

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
the best looking ones cuz you can win

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.620 
the best looking ones cuz you can win
with<00:03:24.900> almost<00:03:25.200> any<00:03:25.500> any<00:03:26.220> outfit<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.360> think

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
with almost any any outfit and I think

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.440 
with almost any any outfit and I think
they<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.080> look<00:03:28.530> more<00:03:29.400> beats<00:03:29.730> if<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.330> know

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
they just look more beats if you know

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.410 
they just look more beats if you know
what<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.600> mean<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.410> they<00:03:32.310> look<00:03:32.700> more<00:03:32.910> grown<00:03:33.299> up

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
what I mean and they look more grown up

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.060 
what I mean and they look more grown up
at<00:03:33.840> least<00:03:34.049> am<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.350> in<00:03:35.310> my<00:03:35.489> case<00:03:36.620> other<00:03:37.620> than<00:03:37.739> that

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
at least am I in my case other than that

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.550 
at least am I in my case other than that
there's<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.910> great<00:03:39.269> button<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.170> ear<00:03:40.320> cup
