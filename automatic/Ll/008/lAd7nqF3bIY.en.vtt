 in her larina and care mascot units 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.330
 per liter jar not per liter of water 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.440
 she's a liter jar 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.160

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.919
 shuffle put on fire and wait 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.350
 so she started to boil and the way the water 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.770
 just starts to boil we add vinegar 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.410
 and you need to boil the water completely and 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.740
 when it boils you can pour the jar 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:28.890

 cover and leave for 15-20 minutes 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.600
 now you need to sterilize the bank for 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.360
 take a bowl or saucepan 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.010
 which you do not really need or 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.490

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.350
 on the bottom of the carpeted 2 and rabid rags 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.669
 Here I have two pieces on but here 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:55.169

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.990
 the bank stood for 20 minutes lower it in on 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:08.160
 zhki ready if you 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.790

 jar in the pot of boiling water and leading away 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.510
 be prepared because if 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.540
 cool brand will burst keep that in mind 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.000
 Now add water as much boiling water 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.580
 to be as high as possible 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.400
 so that from the pan does not flow and 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.500
 the jar is covered with water he look at 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.360

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.490
 bend 10 minutes here's the water started 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.410
 boil after boiling for 10 minutes she 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.890
 still has to boil over here you will see 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.710
 bubbles and cucumbers should change their 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:56.310
 color from bright green to this color 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:59.160
 our protective jar is already boiling for 10 minutes 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.860

 take out the jar put it on a towel 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:15.570
