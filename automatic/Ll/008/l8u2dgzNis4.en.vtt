00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
able to get a chance to see my last

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.350 
able to get a chance to see my last
video<00:00:49.510> where<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.470> actually<00:00:51.100> colored<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.059> hair

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
video where I actually colored this hair

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.939 
video where I actually colored this hair
okay<00:00:53.140> so<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:53.650> colored<00:00:54.040> it<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.780> soft<00:00:56.739> or

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
okay so I colored it to a a soft or

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.920 
okay so I colored it to a a soft or
natural<00:00:57.370> black<00:00:57.610> I<00:00:58.000> mean<00:00:58.479> the<00:00:58.570> reason<00:00:58.780> why<00:00:58.870> did

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
natural black I mean the reason why did

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.590 
natural black I mean the reason why did
that<00:00:59.140> is<00:00:59.290> because<00:00:59.650> it<00:01:00.190> allows<00:01:00.580> it<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.879> match<00:01:01.420> a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
that is because it allows it to match a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.710 
that is because it allows it to match a
little<00:01:01.720> bit<00:01:01.960> more<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.440> my<00:01:02.710> own<00:01:03.269> my<00:01:04.269> actually
