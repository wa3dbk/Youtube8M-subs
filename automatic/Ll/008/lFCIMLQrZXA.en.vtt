definitely<00:00:09.110> is<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:09.559> study<00:00:09.800> of<00:00:09.889> death<00:00:10.540> fauna

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
definitely is the study of death fauna

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.070 
definitely is the study of death fauna
me<00:00:11.750> is<00:00:11.929> it's<00:00:12.919> basically<00:00:13.299> what<00:00:14.299> happens<00:00:14.719> to<00:00:14.959> an

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
me is it's basically what happens to an

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.880 
me is it's basically what happens to an
organism<00:00:15.850> after<00:00:16.850> it<00:00:17.000> dies<00:00:17.320> we<00:00:18.320> try<00:00:18.530> to<00:00:18.590> take

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
organism after it dies we try to take

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.730 
organism after it dies we try to take
that<00:00:19.100> a<00:00:19.130> step<00:00:19.280> further<00:00:19.790> and<00:00:20.180> actually<00:00:21.110> think

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
that a step further and actually think

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.660 
that a step further and actually think
about<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:22.340> rotting<00:00:22.910> process<00:00:23.480> itself<00:00:24.020> and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
about the rotting process itself and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.420 
about the rotting process itself and
look<00:00:25.670> for<00:00:25.940> environments<00:00:26.750> where<00:00:26.990> things<00:00:27.430> may

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
look for environments where things may

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.850 
look for environments where things may
actually<00:00:28.730> not<00:00:29.270> happen<00:00:29.870> the<00:00:30.020> same<00:00:30.260> in<00:00:30.680> other

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
actually not happen the same in other

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.450 
actually not happen the same in other
words<00:00:33.190> we're<00:00:34.190> interested<00:00:34.820> in<00:00:35.030> in<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.199> actual

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
words we're interested in in the actual

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.189 
words we're interested in in the actual
bacterial<00:00:37.460> invasion<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:41.390> animal<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:41.989> its

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
bacterial invasion of the animal and its

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.189 
bacterial invasion of the animal and its
skeleton<00:00:42.769> on<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.640> big<00:00:43.999> scale<00:00:44.329> we<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:44.629> say<00:00:44.989> that

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
skeleton on a big scale we can say that

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.160 
skeleton on a big scale we can say that
taphonomy<00:00:45.620> helps<00:00:46.159> us<00:00:46.309> figure<00:00:47.300> out<00:00:47.359> what<00:00:47.659> you

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
taphonomy helps us figure out what you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.770 
taphonomy helps us figure out what you
know<00:00:48.399> what<00:00:49.399> happened<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.089> skeleton<00:00:50.629> after

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
know what happened to the skeleton after

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.579 
know what happened to the skeleton after
it<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.530> animal<00:00:51.949> died<00:00:52.359> whether<00:00:53.359> whether<00:00:54.350> it

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
it the animal died whether whether it

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.500 
it the animal died whether whether it
broader<00:00:54.829> than<00:00:55.249> the<00:00:55.460> stream<00:00:55.879> carries<00:00:56.390> it

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
broader than the stream carries it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.729 
broader than the stream carries it
somewhere<00:00:56.989> or<00:00:57.319> whether<00:00:58.390> animals<00:00:59.390> carried<00:00:59.899> off

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
somewhere or whether animals carried off

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.860 
somewhere or whether animals carried off
pieces<00:01:02.109> when<00:01:03.109> we<00:01:03.139> attempt<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.649> do<00:01:03.979> taphonomy

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
pieces when we attempt to do taphonomy

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.480 
pieces when we attempt to do taphonomy
really<00:01:05.870> you<00:01:06.380> know<00:01:06.470> we<00:01:06.650> don't<00:01:06.770> need<00:01:07.040> very<00:01:07.310> many

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
really you know we don't need very many

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.039 
really you know we don't need very many
tools<00:01:08.560> we<00:01:09.560> need<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> tape<00:01:10.100> measure<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.869> we<00:01:11.869> need

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
tools we need a tape measure and we need

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.830 
tools we need a tape measure and we need
a<00:01:12.079> compass<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:13.909> figure<00:01:14.240> out<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.600> orientation

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
a compass to figure out the orientation

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.590 
a compass to figure out the orientation
of<00:01:15.530> things<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.340> know<00:01:16.430> nowadays<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:17.180> could<00:01:17.360> use

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
of things you know nowadays we could use

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.410 
of things you know nowadays we could use
our<00:01:17.899> lidar<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.920> can<00:01:19.070> actually<00:01:19.219> scan<00:01:20.119> them

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
our lidar you can actually scan them

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.249 
our lidar you can actually scan them
scan<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.259> quarry<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.880> then<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.360> then

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
scan the quarry and then and then

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.679 
scan the quarry and then and then
excavate<00:01:25.159> some<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:25.670> scan<00:01:25.969> it<00:01:26.000> again<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
excavate some and then scan it again the

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.740 
excavate some and then scan it again the
next<00:01:26.899> great<00:01:27.200> smaller<00:01:27.500> scan<00:01:28.039> it<00:01:28.189> again<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
next great smaller scan it again and the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.899 
next great smaller scan it again and the
lidar<00:01:29.960> would<00:01:30.380> actually<00:01:30.799> create<00:01:32.020> 3d<00:01:33.909> digital

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
lidar would actually create 3d digital

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.390 
lidar would actually create 3d digital
images<00:01:35.630> of

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
images of

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.030 
images of
of<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:37.000> site<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.270> you're<00:01:37.600> looking<00:01:37.930> at<00:01:38.140> but<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
of a site that you're looking at but the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.850 
of a site that you're looking at but the
whole<00:01:39.190> idea<00:01:39.370> is<00:01:39.880> really<00:01:40.270> just<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:41.320> map<00:01:41.590> the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
whole idea is really just to map the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.720 
whole idea is really just to map the
position<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.670> all<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.360> bones<00:01:44.370> taphonomy<00:01:45.370> is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
position of all the bones taphonomy is

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.820 
position of all the bones taphonomy is
can<00:01:46.540> only<00:01:46.720> be<00:01:46.960> done<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:50.050> site<00:01:50.260> hasn't<00:01:50.500> been

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
can only be done if a site hasn't been

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.880 
can only be done if a site hasn't been
disturbed<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:52.540> people<00:01:52.870> find<00:01:53.230> dinosaur

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
disturbed when people find dinosaur

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.090 
disturbed when people find dinosaur
bones<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.420> best<00:01:55.630> thing<00:01:55.840> they<00:01:55.990> could<00:01:56.050> do<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.530> is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
bones the best thing they could do is is

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.820 
bones the best thing they could do is is
call<00:01:57.730> a<00:01:57.760> museum<00:01:58.330> call<00:01:58.900> us<00:01:59.020> up<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.410> let<00:01:59.530> us<00:01:59.560> know

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
call a museum call us up and let us know

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.680 
call a museum call us up and let us know
that<00:02:00.040> they<00:02:00.160> found<00:02:00.430> something<00:02:00.700> because<00:02:01.240> as

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
that they found something because as

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.530 
that they found something because as
soon<00:02:01.930> as<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.230> pick<00:02:02.470> something<00:02:02.890> up<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.360> have

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
soon as you pick something up you have

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.250 
soon as you pick something up you have
disturbed<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.200> site<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:07.110> there's<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
disturbed the site and there's the

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.230 
disturbed the site and there's the
possibility<00:02:08.980> if<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.160> if<00:02:09.460> you<00:02:09.580> pick<00:02:09.820> very<00:02:10.030> much

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
possibility if you if you pick very much

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.350 
possibility if you if you pick very much
of<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.540> up<00:02:10.690> then<00:02:11.680> there<00:02:12.460> really<00:02:12.610> isn't<00:02:12.880> any<00:02:13.150> way

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
of it up then there really isn't any way

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.960 
of it up then there really isn't any way
that<00:02:13.600> we<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.900> determine<00:02:14.850> whether<00:02:15.850> it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
that we can determine whether it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:24.210 
that we can determine whether it
happened<00:02:16.330> at<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.780> site

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
