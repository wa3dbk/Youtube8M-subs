00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
prefer it and this actually does give

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.850 
prefer it and this actually does give
you<00:00:57.909> a<00:00:57.940> pretty<00:00:58.269> good<00:00:58.390> tactile<00:00:59.170> feel<00:00:59.589> and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
you a pretty good tactile feel and

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.160 
you a pretty good tactile feel and
visibility<00:01:00.519> of<00:01:00.879> everything<00:01:01.420> except<00:01:02.080> for

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
visibility of everything except for

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.920 
visibility of everything except for
reports<00:01:02.619> maybe<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.220> touch<00:01:03.489> screen<00:01:03.670> I<00:01:04.059> don't<00:01:04.540> I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
reports maybe a touch screen I don't I

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
reports maybe a touch screen I don't I
never<00:01:05.199> actually<00:01:05.320> try<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.680> touch<00:01:05.920> your

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
never actually try to touch your

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.350 
never actually try to touch your
connection<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:06.580> maybe<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:06.850> could<00:01:07.150> use<00:01:07.330> it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
connection so maybe you could use it

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.830 
connection so maybe you could use it
through<00:01:07.659> it<00:01:07.750> but<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.710> can<00:01:08.799> see<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.600> can't

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
through it but as you can see you can't

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.870 
through it but as you can see you can't
actually<00:01:10.990> see<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.380> screen<00:01:11.650> there<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.460> it's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
actually see the screen there but it's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.460 
actually see the screen there but it's
obviously<00:01:13.240> not<00:01:13.330> going<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.660> be<00:01:13.750> as<00:01:13.900> perfect<00:01:14.170> as

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
obviously not going to be as perfect as

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.320 
obviously not going to be as perfect as
viewing<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.890> screen<00:01:15.130> on<00:01:15.280> its<00:01:15.430> own<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:16.090> could

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
viewing the screen on its own you could

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.690 
viewing the screen on its own you could
even<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.630> guess<00:01:16.870> cut<00:01:17.320> out<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.770> screen<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.580> you

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
even I guess cut out the screen if you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.910 
even I guess cut out the screen if you
wanted<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.210> but<00:01:19.810> it's<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.080> really<00:01:20.260> basic<00:01:20.470> thing

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
wanted to but it's a really basic thing

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.950 
wanted to but it's a really basic thing
all<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:21.670> really<00:01:21.820> do<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.210> you<00:01:22.300> take<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.600> camera

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
all you really do is you take the camera

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.660 
all you really do is you take the camera
and<00:01:23.440> I'm<00:01:23.530> just<00:01:23.650> going<00:01:23.800> to<00:01:23.830> take<00:01:23.980> it<00:01:24.040> out<00:01:24.280> and

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
and I'm just going to take it out and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.690 
and I'm just going to take it out and
reverse<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.390> process<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.550> take<00:01:27.550> off

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
reverse the process for you take off

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.360 
reverse the process for you take off
this<00:01:27.880> thing<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:29.290> camera<00:01:29.620> just<00:01:29.650> goes<00:01:29.950> right<00:01:30.220> on

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
this thing the camera just goes right on

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.260 
this thing the camera just goes right on
the<00:01:30.430> tail<00:01:30.640> end<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:33.310> basic<00:01:33.520> I've

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
the tail end of it so pretty basic I've

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.300 
the tail end of it so pretty basic I've
actually<00:01:34.420> been<00:01:34.600> using<00:01:34.930> with<00:01:35.020> my<00:01:35.170> c<00:01:35.440> 100<00:01:36.130> and

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
actually been using with my c 100 and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.490 
actually been using with my c 100 and
the<00:01:36.940> c100<00:01:37.630> even<00:01:37.930> though<00:01:38.020> it's<00:01:38.110> bigger<00:01:38.290> than<00:01:38.380> a

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
the c100 even though it's bigger than a

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.770 
the c100 even though it's bigger than a
DSLR<00:01:39.070> this<00:01:39.730> thing<00:01:39.909> seems<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.360> work<00:01:40.510> pretty

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
DSLR this thing seems to work pretty

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.890 
DSLR this thing seems to work pretty

but as you can see this is the size of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.089 
but as you can see this is the size of
the<00:02:10.030> 5d<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.599> lens<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.739> just<00:02:11.920> goes

right in
pretty<00:02:14.590> easily<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.120> hole<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.840> they

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
pretty easily and that hole that they

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.010 
pretty easily and that hole that they
put<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.260> for<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.590> lines<00:02:17.830> up<00:02:18.099> with<00:02:18.280> your

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
put in for you lines up with your

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.979 
put in for you lines up with your
viewfinder<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.830> easy<00:02:20.980> viewing<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.420> one

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
viewfinder for easy viewing so and one

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.140 
viewfinder for easy viewing so and one
other<00:02:23.080> trick<00:02:23.319> actually<00:02:23.590> has<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.520> cinch<00:02:24.880> is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
other trick actually has this cinch is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
other trick actually has this cinch is
practically<00:02:25.930> useless<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.360> cinch<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.900> but

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
practically useless it can cinch up but

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.680 
practically useless it can cinch up but
then<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:30.000> can't<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:31.239> do<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:31.360> with<00:02:31.540> one

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
then I can't really do that with one

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.449 
then I can't really do that with one
hand<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:31.959> anyways<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:32.800> cinch<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.190> up<00:02:33.280> it's

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
hand but anyways if you cinch it up it's

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.770 
hand but anyways if you cinch it up it's
pretty<00:02:33.700> much<00:02:33.850> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> always<00:02:34.180> go<00:02:34.390> behind

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
pretty much going to always go behind

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.449 
pretty much going to always go behind
the<00:02:34.900> hood<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:35.980> do<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.250> take<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
the hood so what I just do is take a

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.100 
the hood so what I just do is take a
little<00:02:36.580> bit<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.760> gaff<00:02:36.940> tape<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.270> whether

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
little bit of gaff tape and whether

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.479 
little bit of gaff tape and whether
using<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.500> rubber<00:02:38.620> hood<00:02:38.860> like<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.250> or<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
using a rubber hood like this or the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.910 
using a rubber hood like this or the
built-in<00:02:39.850> hood<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.720> go<00:02:40.870> ahead<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.050> tape<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
built-in hood just go ahead and tape the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.610 
built-in hood just go ahead and tape the
end<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.060> very<00:02:43.239> rear<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.440> hood

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
end of this to the very rear of the hood

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.830 
end of this to the very rear of the hood
and<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:45.130> will<00:02:45.220> hold<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.610> just<00:02:45.850> fine<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.209> that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
and it will hold up just fine so that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.270 
and it will hold up just fine so that
