00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
workrate so I didn't really have to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.130 
workrate so I didn't really have to
notice<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> passing<00:03:07.239> too<00:03:07.390> much<00:03:07.600> because<00:03:07.840> he

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
notice the passing too much because he

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.479 
notice the passing too much because he

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
and I feel like the 89 was pretty solid

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.260 
and I feel like the 89 was pretty solid
at<00:04:35.390> more<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:35.870> everything<00:04:36.590> but<00:04:37.250> heading<00:04:37.700> but

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
at more of everything but heading but

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.480 
at more of everything but heading but
then<00:04:38.450> when<00:04:38.960> I<00:04:38.990> tried<00:04:39.200> to<00:04:39.410> team<00:04:39.890> of<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.070> season

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
then when I tried to team of the season

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.550 
then when I tried to team of the season
his<00:04:41.060> heading<00:04:41.480> just<00:04:41.810> got<00:04:41.930> like<00:04:42.080> ten<00:04:42.380> times

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
his heading just got like ten times

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.790 
his heading just got like ten times
better<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.550> don't<00:04:44.510> really<00:04:44.840> know<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.200> guess<00:04:45.380> it

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
better so I don't really know I guess it

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.500 
better so I don't really know I guess it
I<00:04:45.950> guess<00:04:46.250> I<00:04:46.370> would<00:04:46.520> say<00:04:46.550> based<00:04:46.940> on<00:04:47.150> your<00:04:47.240> play

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
I guess I would say based on your play

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.020 
I guess I would say based on your play
style<00:04:47.780> if<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.290> like<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:49.190> way<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.610> Falcao

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
style if you like the way that Falcao

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.550 
style if you like the way that Falcao
plays<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.900> he's<00:04:51.680> target<00:04:52.250> man<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:53.350> you<00:04:54.350> like

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
plays and he's target man and you like

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.500 
plays and he's target man and you like
to<00:04:54.680> cross<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:55.070> in<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.340> would<00:04:55.520> say<00:04:55.700> go<00:04:56.270> for<00:04:56.450> the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
to cross it in I would say go for the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.030 
to cross it in I would say go for the
team<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.810> season<00:04:57.050> because<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.290> did<00:04:57.590> notice<00:04:57.800> a

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
team of season because I did notice a

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.790 
team of season because I did notice a
big<00:04:58.280> increase<00:04:58.640> on<00:04:58.940> his<00:04:59.330> heading<00:04:59.780> but<00:05:00.320> if<00:05:00.590> you

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
big increase on his heading but if you

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.830 
big increase on his heading but if you
like<00:05:01.040> him<00:05:01.490> playing<00:05:01.820> more<00:05:02.150> just<00:05:02.330> as<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.450> normal

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
like him playing more just as a normal

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.990 
like him playing more just as a normal
striker<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:04.340> know<00:05:04.430> working<00:05:04.640> his<00:05:04.820> way<00:05:04.850> through

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
striker you know working his way through

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.450

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
the defense using those four star skills

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.040 
the defense using those four star skills
using<00:05:07.640> that<00:05:07.790> five-star<00:05:08.210> weak<00:05:08.540> foot<00:05:08.810> then<00:05:08.990> I

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
using that five-star weak foot then I

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.360 
using that five-star weak foot then I
