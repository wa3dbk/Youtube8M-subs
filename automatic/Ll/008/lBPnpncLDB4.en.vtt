00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 I have here a laugh and I want 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.900
 with biscuits 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.030
 in a fear with such a lamello 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.599
 and those cards if I get half one 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.890
 fear it will come 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.020
 h storms let you go so I suggested 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.570
 have such a thin layer and I don't want that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.060
 then I have to go shallow one way 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.309
 belong and the other side is a stunt 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 deeper other stitch that looks natural 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 that whole card so you have to be able to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 the one side 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 shallow and the other way deep that i go 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.079
 now just do this here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.420
 because I want no more than the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.520
 half that layer 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.210
 that means i have one here 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.210
 line up 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.190
 so I will use that line 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:26.939
 I can try this or look at that below 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 the line is coming now I see the line 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.020
 still so i want him there something 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.759
 underneath 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.969
 let's see if it can come out again 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.969
 get it 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:54.460
 when I booked something shifter 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:58.180
 look here put I have me and nuts and me 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.640
 no it is a bit 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.350
 just have a look deeper 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.350
 so I have to drive him something out 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.420
 you have a few strokes free that you have to 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.420
 a little on and then 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:29.030
 then I try my kaki and then it is 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:31.340
 line there just below this one biggest 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.170
 part there is the line 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.170
 then I take a look and that dress that goes 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:48.859
 so and now I have a certain size 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.609
 I'm going to convince that and then 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.209
 I put on by dashes so that I am 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:59.260
 not mistaken 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.260
 and then I'm going to set the other side like that 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:07.239
 now I see a line here and how 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:13.939
 let's fear that 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:16.040
 because that must now come here and then 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.750
 can I put that leaf firmly on the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.120
 workbench but I actually have to and 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.650
 support too thick 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.060
 this leaves you a kind of board behind it 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.849
 where i mine 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.489
 and slat cutter can learn so me 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:37.010
 must have a 26mm load 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.040
 I have a slip of a 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.489
 floor plate is 18 and a piece of plywood 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.790
 and if I add that together then 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.930
 I am slightly higher than my mine 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.819
 are you laughing? 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.199
 so I have to extract some of this then 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.090
 I can do that 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.090
 make a combination of these two 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.060
 look now we fear no where one 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.530
 plateau on which can fear but 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.120
 I must to the shallower 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.330
 because namely to stand in depth 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.510
 so he has to be a lot shallower and I have 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.270
 different positions before that but that 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.270
 I have to settle you with that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.270
 screw 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.350
 so he must be shallow so i go 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.350
 all the way 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.400
 so let's see if that 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:31.030
 look and that is also included 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.030
 so he goes 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.020
 and I do it like that then it goes there 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.670
 easy in and then the top is 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.050
 equal 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:48.050
 not exactly, but then I 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.170
 for be careful that this is also exact or 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.460
 slightly lower than this is from it of that 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.980
 let you 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.970
 because then you see that the still unequal 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.680
 word 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.300
 so you have to be careful with this but this 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.980
 goes very well 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.840
 so you can do that with a thin layer 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.550
 anyway and it's easy with lines too 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.870
 he is right on the right size as 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.870
 you try this out exactly
