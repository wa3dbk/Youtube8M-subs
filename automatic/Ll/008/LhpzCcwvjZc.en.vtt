00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.080
 2015 ultimate time this 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.400
 the children of the downloads I leave 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 in the description the goods are 900 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 from the dsd and 15 megs of the application 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.560
 then for the program that you have using 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.560

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.430
 little bit

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.500

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.690

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.490

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.490

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.170
