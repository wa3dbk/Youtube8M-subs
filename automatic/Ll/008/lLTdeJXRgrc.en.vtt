00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
got n draft Wireless I mean the things

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
got n draft Wireless I mean the things
got<00:00:31.050> everything<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.189> let's<00:00:32.340> start<00:00:32.520> off<00:00:32.610> with

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
got everything so let's start off with

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
got everything so let's start off with
the<00:00:32.850> display<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.510> obviously<00:00:33.719> that's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the display because obviously that's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.780 
the display because obviously that's
kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> centerpiece<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.489> here

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
kind of like the centerpiece on here

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.600 
kind of like the centerpiece on here
you're<00:00:36.510> looking<00:00:36.630> at<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> 16<00:00:37.559> by<00:00:37.800> 9<00:00:37.829> display<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you're looking at a 16 by 9 display so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
you're looking at a 16 by 9 display so
native<00:00:39.090> sixteen<00:00:39.870> by<00:00:40.020> nine<00:00:40.050> format<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.710> means

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
native sixteen by nine format that means

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.319 
native sixteen by nine format that means
when<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.070> watch<00:00:41.250> movies<00:00:41.670> they're<00:00:41.820> gonna<00:00:41.910> have

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
when you watch movies they're gonna have

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
when you watch movies they're gonna have
no<00:00:42.570> letter<00:00:42.809> boxes<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> side<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.770> long<00:00:43.800> as

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
no letter boxes on the side as long as

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
no letter boxes on the side as long as
they're<00:00:44.160> sixteen<00:00:44.489> by<00:00:44.610> nine<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:45.510> actually

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
they're sixteen by nine it's actually

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.630 
they're sixteen by nine it's actually
sixteen<00:00:46.320> hundred<00:00:46.649> by<00:00:47.070> nine<00:00:47.399> hundred

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
sixteen hundred by nine hundred

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
sixteen hundred by nine hundred
ironically<00:00:48.570> enough<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> perfect

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
ironically enough so that's the perfect

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.049 
ironically enough so that's the perfect
resolution<00:00:49.739> means<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.160> do<00:00:50.219> 720p<00:00:50.489> native

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
resolution means you can do 720p native

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150 
resolution means you can do 720p native
and<00:00:51.210> very<00:00:51.629> close<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> 1080p<00:00:52.469> native<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:52.949> well

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
and very close to 1080p native as well

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
and very close to 1080p native as well
of<00:00:53.760> course<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> always<00:00:54.360> output<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
of course you can always output that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.260 
of course you can always output that
with<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> HDMI<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> big<00:00:56.550> TV<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.059> full

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
with the HDMI so a big TV and do full

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
with the HDMI so a big TV and do full
1080<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.350> will<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.219> nine<00:00:59.370> hundred

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
1080 but this will do up to nine hundred

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.920 
1080 but this will do up to nine hundred
lines<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> resolution<00:01:00.030> which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.539> great<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
lines of resolution which is great it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930 
lines of resolution which is great it's
also<00:01:01.230> LED<00:01:01.620> backed<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:02.340> gonna<00:01:02.430> save<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> some

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
also LED backed it's gonna save you some

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.189 
also LED backed it's gonna save you some

it's a premium webcam really nice
low-light<00:01:09.600> performance<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.439> saw

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
low-light performance from what I saw

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
low-light performance from what I saw
looked<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:11.939> good<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> dark

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
looked really really good in the dark

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
looked really really good in the dark
area<00:01:13.140> where<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.320> testing<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.770> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
area where I was testing it which is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.200 
area where I was testing it which is
basically<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> studio<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> lights<00:01:15.060> are

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
basically the studio when the lights are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
basically the studio when the lights are
turned<00:01:15.509> off<00:01:15.689> now<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.470> top<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.009> does

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
turned off now on top of that it does

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
turned off now on top of that it does
have<00:01:17.340> an<00:01:17.430> Intel<00:01:17.670> Core<00:01:17.850> i5<00:01:17.970> processor<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.780> the

gonna<00:03:06.240> plug<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.690> your<00:03:06.840> power<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.070> a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
gonna plug in your power this was a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.890 
gonna plug in your power this was a
modem<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.820> is<00:03:08.940> not<00:03:09.120> actually<00:03:09.360> there

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
modem but that is not actually there

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.530 
modem but that is not actually there
it's<00:03:10.200> just<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.440> blank<00:03:10.710> space<00:03:11.270> this<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.300> your

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
it's just a blank space this is your

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.390 
it's just a blank space this is your
eSATA<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.350> we<00:03:13.410> already<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.740> one<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.100> board<00:03:14.340> if

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
eSATA so we already have one on board if

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.590 
eSATA so we already have one on board if
you<00:03:14.490> want<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.670> add<00:03:14.760> more<00:03:15.000> later<00:03:15.180> through<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
you want to add more later through that

you want to add more later through that
Express<00:03:15.900> card<00:03:16.140> slot<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.800> this<00:03:17.310> would<00:03:17.490> be

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
Express card slot you can this would be

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.480 
Express card slot you can this would be
your<00:03:17.910> 10100<00:03:18.780> Ethernet<00:03:18.900> port<00:03:19.470> right<00:03:19.650> next<00:03:20.400> to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
your 10100 Ethernet port right next to

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.090 
your 10100 Ethernet port right next to
an<00:03:20.610> additional<00:03:21.180> USB<00:03:21.600> 2.0<00:03:22.110> port<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.500> then<00:03:22.890> over

an additional USB 2.0 port and then over
here<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:23.940> ways<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.209> get<00:03:24.330> video

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
here you have the two ways to get video

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.410 
here you have the two ways to get video
out<00:03:24.800> which<00:03:25.800> is<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.100> VGA<00:03:26.400> port<00:03:26.730> d-sub<00:03:27.270> 15-pin

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
out which is the VGA port d-sub 15-pin

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.650 
out which is the VGA port d-sub 15-pin
for<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.080> monitor<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.400> HDMI<00:03:30.060> output<00:03:30.540> which

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
for a monitor and the HDMI output which

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.790 
for a monitor and the HDMI output which
is<00:03:30.690> really<00:03:30.959> nice<00:03:31.080> because<00:03:31.140> that'll<00:03:31.410> give<00:03:31.620> you
