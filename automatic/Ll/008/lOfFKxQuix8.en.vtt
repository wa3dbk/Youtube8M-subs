00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.120
 hi how are you all here I have another 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.300
 video is not teaching how I did the 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.160
 painting or as the flag says that's going to 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.190
 come after this more than I have to 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.100
 finish other projects that I have to 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.140
 do and now I'm going to teach this 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.810
 has done this I am missing two more things 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.660
 what am I going to do and then I'm going to do 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.240
 the tutorial as I do if I do my 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.310
 paintings and how do I make the flags or how 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.750
 make a flag with the name but the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.510
 first thing I want to teach you 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.810
 I want to teach are two boxes that I made 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.210
 I 've done it before 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.160
 when it was I think two years and I 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.590
 I also have it here in Spanish but what 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.400
 did I did the same thing rather than use the 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.020
 new 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.170
 images that I have for sale 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.360
 and this is the first box this base 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.350
 I think this is going to be the one I'm going to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.230
 give a friend of mine who gave me some 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.560
 Little things almost like to say thank you 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.400
 just as the painting is the box that 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.940
 I have already done it once before and here 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.730
 is 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.810
 is the box 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.670
 the difference is this the skull that is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.090
 one of the images that I have window in 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090
 my blog 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.600
 color and there I put them this as it is called 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.410
 to glue with bright are the ones like that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.720
 can see in the eye and in this in the 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.270
 flower and I put the eros links in the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.550
 little flowers are in the box the first 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.790
 c2 box and will have one I'll give 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.450
 sale and then the other this is just to see 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 my friend but I also read four 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.100
 cards inside 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 This is the first or as it does not matter very 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 ok and then this is the other one is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.840
 care 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.180
 because I have two fridas that I drew and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.390
 Then it 's this and that's what I did 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.659
 cut to see the suit in the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.819
 card because if they put in the image 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.370
 most reputed her smallest 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.189
 I could not color it because I was very 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.599
 very very small but I did it alone 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.219
 they are from the cards and inside is 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.249
 also simple a piece of paper 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:23.040
 white or white cardboard and so it goes 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:25.620
 in and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.900
 this is the same no more than with a paper 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.150
 little bit different 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.150
 and if you look 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 and then I have a tutorial like I did 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.920
 I'm not there but in the first box I made 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.830
 and here are the other cards 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.830
 same 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.980
 and later 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.310
 another thing that I did 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.650
 It's a card for a friend friend who 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.190
 is going to give it to another friend for a 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.260
 birthday and this card that I made is 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.500
 another little doll that draws and I think 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.129
 I'm going to change it a little or this one 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.690
 just still but that's how it is here 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.420
 it is and what is inside 100 simple 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.210
 as well 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.780
 but this card I put him 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.940
 this spray that you have that has to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.430
 bright I do not know if they can see the best 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.069
 do not 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.849
 you can not see then there 's the card 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.670
 and then another thing to give and that I wanted 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.430
 tell them is if they go to my blog to my blog to 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.069
 my website that is I'm going to leave everything 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.069

 that I'm going to put on paintings just not 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.969
 I 've done it yet but if I'm going to 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.950
 have here I am eating it from a little bit 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.959

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.430
 I'm selling, I'm selling 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.480

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.090

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.410
 I have them there my site and then 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.239
