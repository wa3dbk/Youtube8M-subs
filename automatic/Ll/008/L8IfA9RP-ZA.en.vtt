vehicles here and drag it on over here

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
vehicles here and drag it on over here
it's<00:01:41.549> basically<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.060> simple<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.540> really

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it's basically that simple it's really

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.690 
it's basically that simple it's really
easy<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.549> for

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
easy to do and you really do that for

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
easy to do and you really do that for
everything<00:01:44.880> else<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.680> go<00:01:46.829> back

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
dragon project d 2.0 it mean it's just

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.470 
dragon project d 2.0 it mean it's just
really<00:02:04.420> easy<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.830> that's<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.970> project<00:02:07.330> D

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
really easy and that's for the project D

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.749 
really easy and that's for the project D
mod<00:02:07.690> now<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:08.740> for<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.130> real<00:02:09.280> feel<00:02:09.550> mod

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
mod now just for the real feel mod

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.460 
mod now just for the real feel mod
really<00:02:10.390> all<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.780> got<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:11.020> do<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.320> just

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
really all you got to do is just

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.960 
really all you got to do is just
dragging<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> two<00:02:12.130> files<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.670> are<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:12.940> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
dragging the two files that are in the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.160 
dragging the two files that are in the
real<00:02:13.150> Phil<00:02:13.300> mod<00:02:13.450> into<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> main<00:02:14.020> directory

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
real Phil mod into the main directory

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.710 
real Phil mod into the main directory
here<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.830> then<00:02:15.310> real<00:02:15.520> Phil<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.820> installed<00:02:16.150> now

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
here and then real Phil is installed now

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.630 
here and then real Phil is installed now
two<00:02:16.870> ways<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:17.950> real<00:02:18.130> fill<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.490> can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
two ways to just real fill you can

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.800 
two ways to just real fill you can
actually<00:02:18.730> adjust<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.210> feedback<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.750> how

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
actually adjust the feedback and how

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.370 
actually adjust the feedback and how
smooth<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
smooth it is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.700 
smooth it is
if<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.950> press<00:02:21.130> uhm<00:02:21.990> pretty<00:02:22.990> sure<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.410> ctrl

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
if you press uhm pretty sure it's ctrl

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.570 
if you press uhm pretty sure it's ctrl
alt<00:02:23.920> +<00:02:24.540> 1<00:02:25.540> or<00:02:25.870> 3<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> numpad<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:27.220> increase

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
alt + 1 or 3 on the numpad to increase

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.430 
alt + 1 or 3 on the numpad to increase
or<00:02:27.760> decrease<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:32.020> force<00:02:32.260> feedback

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
or decrease the the force feedback

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.650 
or decrease the the force feedback
forests<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.160> guess<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.880> could<00:02:34.000> say<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.390> then

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
forests I guess you could say and then

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.140 
forests I guess you could say and then
it's<00:02:34.900> 7<00:02:35.290> or<00:02:35.410> 9<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:36.280> increase<00:02:36.670> or<00:02:36.820> decrease<00:02:36.850> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
it's 7 or 9 to increase or decrease the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.990 
it's 7 or 9 to increase or decrease the
smoothness<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.840> wheel<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.580> 7<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.790> down

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
smoothness of the wheel and 7 is down

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.620 
smoothness of the wheel and 7 is down
and<00:02:40.300> 1<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.750> down<00:02:40.959> for<00:02:41.709> each<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.010> those<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.630> there

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
and 1 is down for each of those so there

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.820 
and 1 is down for each of those so there
it<00:02:43.720> now<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.900> know<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.470> can<00:02:44.590> get<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
it now you know that so you can get the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.770 
it now you know that so you can get the
the<00:02:45.250> real<00:02:45.430> field<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.820> feel<00:02:46.360> how<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.750> it

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the real field of feel how you like it

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.060 
the real field of feel how you like it
if<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.110> have<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.260> 900<00:02:47.650> rear<00:02:47.740> wheel<00:02:47.890> if<00:02:47.980> you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
if you have a 900 rear wheel if you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.370 
if you have a 900 rear wheel if you
don't<00:02:48.340> have<00:02:48.520> a<00:02:48.550> wheel<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.540> not<00:02:49.780> need<00:02:50.140> real

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
don't have a wheel you not need real

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.270 
don't have a wheel you not need real
feel<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:52.620> don't<00:02:53.620> know<00:02:53.800> why<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:53.980> play<00:02:54.160> off

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
feel I don't know why you play off

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.530 
feel I don't know why you play off
factor<00:02:54.580> without<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.850> wheel<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.390> don't

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
factor without a wheel but you don't

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.750 
factor without a wheel but you don't
really<00:02:55.690> need<00:02:55.840> one<00:02:55.900> or<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.190> don't<00:02:57.310> need<00:02:57.490> real

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
really need one or you don't need real

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.930 
really need one or you don't need real
Phil<00:02:58.000> -<00:02:58.269> yeah<00:02:59.250> if<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.340> don't<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.610> wheel<00:03:00.730> so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
Phil - yeah if you don't have a wheel so

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.240 
Phil - yeah if you don't have a wheel so
yeah<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.959> that's<00:03:02.050> basically<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.560> after<00:03:03.130> that

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
yeah but that's basically it after that

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400 
yeah but that's basically it after that
you're<00:03:03.760> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.940> open<00:03:04.030> our<00:03:04.209> factor<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.810> it's

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
you're going to open our factor and it's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.870 
you're going to open our factor and it's
going<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.560> open<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:06.550> going<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.730> like

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
going to open and it's going to like

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.580 
going to open and it's going to like
have<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> splash<00:03:07.360> screen<00:03:07.390> same<00:03:07.930> priority<00:03:08.230> 2.0

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
have a splash screen same priority 2.0

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.330 
have a splash screen same priority 2.0
you<00:03:09.280> skip<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.670> two<00:03:09.790> little<00:03:10.030> intros<00:03:11.190> well<00:03:12.190> I'll

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
you skip the two little intros well I'll

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.860 
you skip the two little intros well I'll
make<00:03:12.400> sure<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.640> have<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.790> cracked<00:03:13.180> hour<00:03:13.450> factor

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
make sure you have a cracked hour factor

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.479 
make sure you have a cracked hour factor
if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.560> know<00:03:14.650> how<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.860> crack<00:03:15.010> our<00:03:15.190> factor

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
if you know how to crack our factor

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.710 
if you know how to crack our factor
basically<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.940> think<00:03:16.060> if<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.600> remember

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
basically I think if I remember

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.820 
basically I think if I remember

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
installed our factor I'm pretty sure you

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.820 
installed our factor I'm pretty sure you
do<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.300> this<00:03:22.390> way<00:03:22.540> if<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.230> there'll<00:03:23.709> be<00:03:23.739> a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
do it this way if you there'll be a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.990 
do it this way if you there'll be a
cracked<00:03:24.130> one<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.400> these<00:03:24.549> if<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.760> find<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
cracked one of these if you find the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.600 
cracked one of these if you find the
cracked<00:03:25.269> exe<00:03:26.080> won't<00:03:26.110> file<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:27.100> overwrite

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
cracked exe won't file just overwrite

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.490 
cracked exe won't file just overwrite
the<00:03:27.880> one<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.690> game<00:03:28.810> installs<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.350> do

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
the one that the game installs and do

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.810 
the one that the game installs and do
not<00:03:29.650> open<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.070> game<00:03:30.190> before<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.610> crack<00:03:30.790> it

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
not open the game before you crack it

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.949 
not open the game before you crack it
because<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.239> open<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.540> game<00:03:31.660> before<00:03:31.810> you

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
because if you open the game before you

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.500 
because if you open the game before you
crack<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.230> then<00:03:32.980> it'll<00:03:33.549> like<00:03:33.640> say<00:03:33.850> demo<00:03:34.209> and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
crack it then it'll like say demo and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.830 
crack it then it'll like say demo and
like<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.780> don't<00:03:34.930> think<00:03:35.049> it'll<00:03:35.470> work<00:03:35.590> properly

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
like I don't think it'll work properly

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.210 
like I don't think it'll work properly
excuse<00:03:37.840> me<00:03:37.930> I've<00:03:38.019> ripped<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.230> little<00:03:38.410> bit<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.709> try

whatever you're doing right now that's
just<00:03:49.930> basically<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.350> graphics<00:03:50.769> mod<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.130> kind<00:03:51.340> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
just basically a graphics mod it kind of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.600 
just basically a graphics mod it kind of
makes<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.900> game<00:03:53.049> look<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.290> bit<00:03:53.440> better<00:03:53.610> and

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
makes the game look a bit better and

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.330 
makes the game look a bit better and
actually<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.590> some<00:03:56.709> info<00:03:56.950> on<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.130> game

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
actually just just some info on the game

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.979 
actually just just some info on the game
it's<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:57.910> really<00:03:58.299> realistic<00:03:58.600> with<00:03:58.870> real

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
it's it's really realistic with real

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.250 
it's it's really realistic with real
feel<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.410> then<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.370> mod<00:04:00.549> a<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.840> fourth<00:04:02.080> bag

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
feel and then the mod a the fourth bag

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.900 
feel and then the mod a the fourth bag
it's<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.620> way<00:04:02.860> better<00:04:03.130> than<00:04:03.340> four<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.640> like

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
it's like way better than four is like

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's like way better than four is like
the<00:04:04.750> first<00:04:04.990> video<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.349> ridiculous

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
the first video is ridiculous

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.270 
the first video is ridiculous
like<00:04:06.519> literally<00:04:07.329> it's<00:04:07.840> almost<00:04:08.170> well<00:04:08.950> I'm

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
like literally it's almost well I'm

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.130 
like literally it's almost well I'm
gonna<00:04:09.700> say<00:04:09.909> almost<00:04:10.239> but<00:04:10.390> it's<00:04:10.480> really<00:04:10.720> close

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
gonna say almost but it's really close

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.979 
gonna say almost but it's really close
to<00:04:11.200> real<00:04:11.590> life<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:13.000> real<00:04:13.180> life<00:04:13.209> when<00:04:13.900> you

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
to real life like in real life when you

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.360 
to real life like in real life when you
transition<00:04:14.409> in<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.560> drift<00:04:14.739> car<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:15.010> just

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
transition in a drift car you just

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.680 
transition in a drift car you just
basically<00:04:15.790> let<00:04:16.030> go<00:04:16.150> of<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.329> wheel<00:04:16.449> and<00:04:16.600> the

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
basically let go of the wheel and the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.670 
basically let go of the wheel and the
car<00:04:16.840> I'll<00:04:16.900> transition<00:04:17.139> yourself<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.620> you

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
car I'll transition yourself and you

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.900 
car I'll transition yourself and you
catch<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.979> wheel<00:04:18.100> that's<00:04:18.549> what<00:04:18.699> you<00:04:18.759> can<00:04:18.850> do

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
catch the wheel that's what you can do

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.699 
catch the wheel that's what you can do
an<00:04:19.000> R<00:04:19.090> factor<00:04:19.449> and<00:04:19.600> it's<00:04:19.690> really<00:04:19.870> cool<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.289> not

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
an R factor and it's really cool to not

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.260 
an R factor and it's really cool to not
like<00:04:20.889> have<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.370> know<00:04:21.489> put<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.000> lot<00:04:22.180> of

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
like have to you know put a lot of

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210 
like have to you know put a lot of
effort<00:04:22.600> well<00:04:23.289> a<00:04:23.320> stuff<00:04:23.650> makes<00:04:23.830> me<00:04:23.919> sound<00:04:24.009> lazy

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
effort well a stuff makes me sound lazy

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.010 
effort well a stuff makes me sound lazy
but<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.270> put<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.419> lot<00:04:25.570> of<00:04:25.630> effort<00:04:25.900> to

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
but you have to put a lot of effort to

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.810 
but you have to put a lot of effort to
drift<00:04:26.199> in<00:04:26.320> Forza<00:04:26.620> like<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.250> got<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.460> flick<00:04:27.669> the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
drift in Forza like you got to flick the

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.640 
drift in Forza like you got to flick the
wheel<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.720> gotta<00:04:28.870> grab<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.560> got

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
wheel and you gotta grab it and you got

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.200 
wheel and you gotta grab it and you got
to<00:04:29.740> move<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.009> a<00:04:30.070> lot<00:04:30.250> R<00:04:30.460> factor<00:04:30.759> is<00:04:30.850> just<00:04:31.000> really

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
to move it a lot R factor is just really

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.650 
to move it a lot R factor is just really
smooth<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.690> easy<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:33.190> like<00:04:34.120> literally<00:04:34.449> that

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
smooth and easy so like literally that

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.129 
smooth and easy so like literally that
that<00:04:34.870> interesting<00:04:35.440> video<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.710> did<00:04:35.889> um<00:04:37.020> which<00:04:38.020> is

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
and everything cost like one credit even

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:01.950

the<00:05:00.820> cars<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.270> they'll<00:05:01.389> create<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:01.780> all<00:05:01.840> that

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
so don't even worry about that so yeah I

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.860 
so don't even worry about that so yeah I
think<00:05:05.770> it's<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.039> to<00:05:06.099> do<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.340> actually<00:05:06.870> yeah

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
think it's going to do it actually yeah

think it's going to do it actually yeah
I<00:05:07.900> think<00:05:07.990> it's<00:05:08.139> gonna<00:05:08.259> do<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.380> so<00:05:08.470> that's<00:05:08.560> theta

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770
