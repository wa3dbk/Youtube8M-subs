00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.030 
I've cut the stems off of the leads what
I'm<00:01:30.350> going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.650> do<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:31.880> like<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.600> lead

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
I'm going to do is just like the lead

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.580 
I'm going to do is just like the lead
horse<00:01:34.040> way<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.760> you<00:01:35.630> want<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.900> keep<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.350> leave

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590

separate<00:01:37.280> from<00:01:37.550> your<00:01:37.730> stems<00:01:38.090> because<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
separate from your stems because the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.340 
separate from your stems because the
leaves<00:01:39.020> cook<00:01:39.470> quicker<00:01:40.220> than<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.090> status<00:01:41.630> so

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350
