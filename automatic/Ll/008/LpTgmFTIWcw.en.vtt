00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.269
 Hi guys , how are you today's recipe? 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.320
 calls be easy cover bowl 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.240
 Brigadeiro 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.550
 is that kind of reference for those who do not 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.820
 You can cook very well just like me. 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.560
 he wants something was intentional but the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.770
 true when you will see is about 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.060
 simple goes only the brigadier ice cream and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.970
 eraser 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.940
 in this one changed I think Maria maria crushed 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.480
 only this good the ingredients are like me 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.579
 said the brigadier I've already done here and this 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.069
 it's cool a little because as you go 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.199
 put the brigadier ice cream is not 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:44.239
 let the brigadeiro cool for who 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.420
 it's a lot of ice cream terrain gets tough 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.210
 When it comes to riding, then Brigadier is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.329
 normal can of condensed milk 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.940
 margarine to be there and choose the 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:10.040
 local as I like too 12 place 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:13.910
 three each and each of these squares of 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.040
 milk cookie maria helena any 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.290
 thing of the genre and turn in turn 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.790
 it is up to you to please 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.130
 preference of yours I'm using 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.720
 recent of dulce de leche is very good 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.400
 This ice cream I 'm not going to tell you from here. 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.600
 good because she's not sponsoring the 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.110
 our video but it's very tasty and well 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.050
 similar to dulce de leche even then 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.080
 limited to a feather it's better to make you 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.690
 You want to strike and strawberry and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.510
 chocolate even then it is the choice of 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.210
 You first people excuse the noise. 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.730
 more equitable raining a lot and I 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.770
 waiting hours but not 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.290
 or that noise that you are 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.800
 listening to the background is that of the rain 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.160
 Good to begin, we'll go with the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.160
 Brigadeiro 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.950
 and you give a little squeeze 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.350
 the wafer and each 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.540
 This is the wafer I put a 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.180
 plastic sachet a little with the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.480
 Mother run in a plastic sack 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 smashing just in time they practiced 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.930
 little bit of bread the pieces do not stick 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.310
 nothing too big, an ice cream only 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.610
 hand that you had a little bit of 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:17.819
 freezer in advance for those who 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:24.630
 Assembly is easy and we will receive 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:26.760
 asking for a ride will be like that. 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.870
 problem with ice cream of sweet 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.670
 milk that is all in the same color as the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.510
 wafer with cream ice cream and look good 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.000
 more beautiful 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:39.410
 and to finish we will play those 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.410
 grass together here just to give a sneaker 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.870
 and that's all you need 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.200
 to do is super simple has nothing to do 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:04.340
 Difficult, you can make the team hernanes. 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.340
 stole the clock and ready 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.440
 super fast and super easy to do and a 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.150
 delicious you can do at these rates 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.480
 large can put directly into a 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.760
 pyrex or a higher refractory can 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.650
 in these smaller ones as well as individual ones 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.540
 very little ones who look really nice 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.090
 also imagine i give you that not 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.340
 I like something very sweet is to replace 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.010
 which Scott has endowed in the 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.380
 brigadeiro already leaves a much less flavor 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.110
 sweet well but there is a chocolate flavor more 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.330
 kind and also replace involve 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.390
 chocolate candy with ice cream 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.950
 lemon fruit for already of the caximba 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.850
 stay a little more steel will break 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.490
 that 12 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.900
 So if you like something - do yourself 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.240
 Do you want to preserve this dessert in 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.910
 something more light is just to unify the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.669
 emerging and assembling according to the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.250
