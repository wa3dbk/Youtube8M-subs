00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.380 
intelligences all right now let's review
the<00:00:46.350> whole<00:00:46.500> process<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.430> separation<00:00:48.090> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the whole process of the separation and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:01:05.929 
the whole process of the separation and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
reading of the two spacecraft but this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.340 
reading of the two spacecraft but this
should<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.740> separation<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
should be the separation we look at the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.810 
should be the separation we look at the
two<00:01:10.530> spacecraft

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.429 

we<00:01:18.820> have<00:01:18.939> mr.<00:01:19.360> Joe<00:01:19.390> champion<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.170> chief

we have mr. Joe champion the chief

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.389 
we have mr. Joe champion the chief
designer<00:01:20.890> at<00:01:21.340> their<00:01:21.939> spacecraft<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:24.159> heard

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
designer at their spacecraft we heard

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.919 
designer at their spacecraft we heard
loud<00:01:25.210> airport<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:27.220> they<00:01:27.340> announced<00:01:27.929> the

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
loud airport when they announced the

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.410 
loud airport when they announced the
success<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.649> docking<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:31.210> were<00:01:31.329> you

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
success of the docking so were you

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.290 
success of the docking so were you
worried

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.540 

well<00:01:40.480> for<00:01:41.480> talking<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.800> have<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.130> make<00:01:43.340> a

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
well for talking you have to make a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.030 
well for talking you have to make a
sinless<00:01:43.820> one<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.960> make<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.140> perfect<00:01:45.440> one<00:01:45.970> and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
sinless one to make the perfect one and

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970 
sinless one to make the perfect one and
we<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:49.370> to<00:01:49.640> be<00:01:50.210> able<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.720> disconnect<00:01:51.590> them

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
we have to be able to disconnect them

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.270 
we have to be able to disconnect them
and<00:01:52.300> reject<00:01:53.300> them<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:57.110> connection<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.800> a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
and reject them so this connection is a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.180 
and reject them so this connection is a
very<00:01:58.580> important<00:01:59.180> job<00:02:02.110> when<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.410> disconnect

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
very important job when we disconnect

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.790 
very important job when we disconnect
the<00:02:04.520> two<00:02:04.700> parts<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.210> means<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.110> final<00:02:06.470> success

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
the two parts it means the final success

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.000 
the two parts it means the final success
of<00:02:06.980> our<00:02:07.160> first<00:02:07.520> talking<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.250> they<00:02:13.400> mature

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
of our first talking so as they mature

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:24.910 
of our first talking so as they mature
and<00:02:18.700> kosher<00:02:19.700> with<00:02:19.880> us<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:22.070> strength<00:02:23.920> notice

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and kosher with us the strength notice

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.270 
and kosher with us the strength notice
how<00:02:25.130> pulsating<00:02:25.880> UFO<00:02:26.450> appears<00:02:26.870> from<00:02:27.140> nowhere

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
how pulsating UFO appears from nowhere

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.160 
how pulsating UFO appears from nowhere
above<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.460> right<00:02:28.670> solar<00:02:29.060> array<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.540> shinzou

aid and passes in high speed by the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.660 
aid and passes in high speed by the
chinese<00:02:32.540> spacecraft<00:02:33.290> i'm<00:02:33.590> not<00:02:34.310> quite<00:02:34.640> sure

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
chinese spacecraft i'm not quite sure

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.000 
chinese spacecraft i'm not quite sure
but<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.660> seems<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.200> does<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> sudden<00:02:36.800> stop

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
but it seems that it does a sudden stop

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.250 
but it seems that it does a sudden stop
and<00:02:37.340> turns<00:02:37.550> back<00:02:37.850> but<00:02:38.330> for<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.570> chinese<00:02:38.990> TV

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
and turns back but for the chinese TV

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.380 
and turns back but for the chinese TV
cut<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.920> replay<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> undocking<00:02:40.970> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
cut to replay the undocking and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.050 
cut to replay the undocking and
definitely<00:02:42.260> it's<00:02:42.470> no<00:02:42.680> space<00:02:43.040> debris<00:02:43.400> ice

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
definitely it's no space debris ice

00:02:44.060 --> 00:03:04.710 
definitely it's no space debris ice
chunk<00:02:44.570> or<00:02:44.780> fuel<00:02:45.050> particle

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.360 

at<00:03:05.720> first<00:03:06.110> glance<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.709> seems<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:07.190> be<00:03:07.340> a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
at first glance it seems to be a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.789 
at first glance it seems to be a
disc-shaped<00:03:07.970> UFO<00:03:08.090> but<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.049> impossible<00:03:09.769> to

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
disc-shaped UFO but it's impossible to

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.460 
disc-shaped UFO but it's impossible to
estimated<00:03:10.519> size<00:03:10.819> in<00:03:11.180> comparison<00:03:11.659> with<00:03:12.230> the

estimated size in comparison with the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.800 
estimated size in comparison with the
Chinese<00:03:12.890> spacecraft<00:03:16.480> that's<00:03:17.480> irrefutable

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
Chinese spacecraft that's irrefutable

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.080 
Chinese spacecraft that's irrefutable
evidence<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.860> an<00:03:18.950> intelligent<00:03:19.580> controlled

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
evidence of an intelligent controlled

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.630 
evidence of an intelligent controlled
object<00:03:20.599> monitoring<00:03:21.590> human<00:03:21.920> activity<00:03:22.489> in

space and it seems that the Chinese
space<00:03:25.220> agency<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.239> less<00:03:26.420> worried<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.019> hide<00:03:27.260> it
