00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.880
 Hello everyone I bring you the myth 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.050
 number 31 in black ops the zombies in the 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.180
 risk map and good already teach in another 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.130
 previous video or in another myth how 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.950
 get good how we got to the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.360
 earth acs me from the map of munt and 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.430
 well some of you told me 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.890
 have a look at the moon that you see 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.620
 since the risk map is valid from the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.059
 classic zombie maps in black ops and 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 Well, I'm going to go there so that 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.230
 take a look so you can see how it is 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.149
 let's say we have the moon but there 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.429
 as it is like the sun from behind as if 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.839
 was an eclipse or something like that but not 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.429
 Well you are going to see now here he got a 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.899
 bit of speed the video because if 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.359
 it does not take long to get the truth 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.280
 it is not close precisely it takes a 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.829
 good time and good I'm using a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.899
 ps3 in dex with a hack using the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.359
 Use mode or the no clip is worth as you want 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.100
 call him and well when we are here the 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.960
 truth is that something that I found very 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 curious but very curious was that a 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.530
 As I was getting closer I was seeing 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.120
 like a red light is worth if you look here 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.830
 there is a kind of several light bulbs 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.620
 red I do not know well what it is because 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.689
 can not be defined well in fact I 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.800
 when I was testing it and such was 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.390
 looking 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.710
 I also did not see exactly what was 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.960
 and as you can see there is the map the truth 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.600
 that is quite far and it takes 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.800
 very much to get here is worth not to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.090
 take so much I would have to put the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.880
 speed but good with speed 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.560
 normal it takes a long time and good and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.030
 As you can see, these little red dots are 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.160
 that I do not know the truth what it is I do not have 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.160
 no idea are like balls there I do not know if 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.900
 you see it well it seems like a pentagon not 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.030
 I do not see it well but it has the shape of a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.770
 pentagon I'm not very sure and good 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.140
 here as you see, well logically it is 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.880
 transparently not that with the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.740
 mode of use is normal that you can 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.540
 to transfer but we go more than anything is 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.670
 so you can see that it is not round that is 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.790
 totally flat voucher is a picture of 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.860
 two dimensions just like what happened with him 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.230
 with the golden gate of the bridge 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.570
 dead the blackout 2 also passed that and 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.020
 good and in the good video on the map 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.550
 from munt 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.140
 the good lord on earth when 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.400
 I was teaching when we got to the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.870
 land was more of the same worth is 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.310
 simply an image in two 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.170
 dimensions and little else because we do not have 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.879
 that interact with this is worth so 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.410
 the nonsense that they say that if my 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.940
 cousin who is my friend and the other and the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.739
 another one that I saw him the one that's that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.239
 really big that you do not even case 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.190
 because they already say nonsense things of the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.019
 moon and earth and nonsense of these 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.310
 do not do anything casual so nothing 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.870
 it is simply this I am going to leave with the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 rest of the video I hope you like it 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 like to put I like favorites and we 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.170
 we see in the next video greetings to 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 everyone 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.210
 yes
