the thing about the ww they can change

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.200 
the thing about the ww they can change
things<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.030> different

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
things they can go in a different

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719 
things they can go in a different
direction<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.520> one

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
direction are they can you know get one

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.149 
direction are they can you know get one
over<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> dirt<00:01:51.240> sheets<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.720> they<00:01:51.869> say<00:01:52.079> um<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
over the dirt sheets as they say um but

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.069 
over the dirt sheets as they say um but

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
but in this predicament I think this is

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
but in this predicament I think this is
the<00:01:55.380> best<00:01:55.740> scenario<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.360> because

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the best scenario to go with because

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
the best scenario to go with because
listen<00:01:58.350> yeah<00:01:58.619> I've<00:01:59.189> been<00:01:59.430> off<00:01:59.579> I've<00:02:00.060> been
