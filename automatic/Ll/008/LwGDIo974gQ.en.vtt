but uh going into steelix on clefable

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.730 
but uh going into steelix on clefable
can<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> risky<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.640> easily<00:02:00.000> be

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
can be risky because it can easily be

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
can be risky because it can easily be
having<00:02:01.740> Fire<00:02:01.979> Blast<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.450> kind<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> why

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
having Fire Blast so that's kind of why

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
having Fire Blast so that's kind of why

he's randomly has some kind of heat wave

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.280 
he's randomly has some kind of heat wave
on<00:03:01.650> there<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:03.209> should<00:03:03.389> be<00:03:03.420> fine<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> drag

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
on there it should be fine to drag

inhale<00:03:04.680> uh<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:06.180> was<00:03:06.629> gonna<00:03:06.840> sub<00:03:07.609> but<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:09.120> thought

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
inhale uh I was gonna sub but I thought

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.220 
inhale uh I was gonna sub but I thought
you<00:03:10.049> know<00:03:10.200> if<00:03:10.829> he<00:03:11.430> has<00:03:11.549> heat<00:03:11.790> wave<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.079> would

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you know if he has heat wave I it would

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.860 
you know if he has heat wave I it would
be<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.440> bad<00:03:13.650> play<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.540> dragon<00:03:15.540> tail<00:03:15.690> would

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
be a bad play and dragon tail would

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.000 
be a bad play and dragon tail would
probably<00:03:16.199> bring<00:03:16.319> him<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> range<00:03:16.859> where

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
probably bring him to the range where

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.409 
probably bring him to the range where
he'd<00:03:17.760> being<00:03:18.000> defeatist<00:03:18.359> uh<00:03:20.060> next<00:03:21.060> time<00:03:21.329> he

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
he'd being defeatist uh next time he

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.180 
he'd being defeatist uh next time he
came<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.750> actually<00:03:22.199> he'd<00:03:22.530> probably<00:03:22.769> do<00:03:22.980> quite

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
came in actually he'd probably do quite

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.009 
came in actually he'd probably do quite
a<00:03:23.220> bit<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.790> go<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.299> earthquake<00:03:24.629> predicting

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
a bit I go for the earthquake predicting

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.439 
a bit I go for the earthquake predicting
the<00:03:25.079> Swift<00:03:25.290> again<00:03:25.730> knowing<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.000> he<00:03:27.120> probably

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
the Swift again knowing that he probably

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.970 
the Swift again knowing that he probably
isn'ta<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:27.989> able<00:03:28.139> do<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> lot<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.470> damage<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.829> me

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
isn'ta be able do a lot of damage to me

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.890 
isn'ta be able do a lot of damage to me
so<00:03:29.930> there's<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.879> think<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.239> go<00:03:33.810> ahead

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
so there's that I think I just go ahead

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.199 
so there's that I think I just go ahead
and<00:03:34.019> dragon<00:03:34.410> tail<00:03:34.560> him<00:03:34.680> out<00:03:34.769> here<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.489> hope

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
and dragon tail him out here and hope

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.699 
and dragon tail him out here and hope
that<00:03:36.480> he<00:03:36.629> goes<00:03:36.750> into<00:03:36.959> like<00:03:37.139> a<00:03:37.169> fable<00:03:37.590> is

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
that he goes into like a fable is

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.189 
that he goes into like a fable is
paralyzing<00:03:38.250> he<00:03:38.430> does<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.750> have<00:03:39.900> enough<00:03:40.109> to

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
paralyzing he does and I have enough to

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.220 
paralyzing he does and I have enough to
make<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.379> sub<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.489> i<00:03:41.879> believe<00:03:42.389> i<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:42.840> go<00:03:43.079> for

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
make a sub but i believe i just go for

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.140 
make a sub but i believe i just go for
the<00:03:43.290> earthquake<00:03:43.889> because<00:03:44.280> i<00:03:44.519> know<00:03:44.699> he<00:03:45.000> can

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
the earthquake because i know he can

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.569 
the earthquake because i know he can
just<00:03:45.299> break<00:03:45.449> myself<00:03:45.660> with<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.019> fire<00:03:46.199> last<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:47.040> he

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
just break myself with a fire last so he

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.250 
just break myself with a fire last so he
actually<00:03:47.730> has<00:03:47.940> flamethrower<00:03:48.419> which<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.049> a

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
actually has flamethrower which is a

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.289 
actually has flamethrower which is a
thing<00:03:49.549> maybe<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.699> doesn't<00:03:50.970> want<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.120> miss

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
thing maybe just doesn't want to miss

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.129 
thing maybe just doesn't want to miss
which<00:03:51.569> is<00:03:51.720> fine<00:03:51.900> i<00:03:52.699> prefer<00:03:53.699> power<00:03:53.940> he<00:03:54.810> prefers

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
which is fine i prefer power he prefers

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:01.009 
which is fine i prefer power he prefers
accuracy<00:03:55.769> uh<00:03:57.079> but<00:03:58.079> he<00:03:58.199> did<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:58.739> i<00:03:59.690> predict<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
accuracy uh but he did so i predict the

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.349 
accuracy uh but he did so i predict the
paralysis<00:04:01.349> year<00:04:01.859> i<00:04:01.980> literally<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.090> I'll

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
paralysis year i literally you know I'll

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.490 
paralysis year i literally you know I'll
just<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:03.690> there<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.169> know<00:04:04.260> i'm<00:04:04.349> just

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
just in there like you know i'm just

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.809 
just in there like you know i'm just
using<00:04:04.680> me<00:04:04.829> paralyzed<00:04:05.190> i<00:04:05.220> know<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.579> dragon

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
using me paralyzed i know for the dragon

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.750 
using me paralyzed i know for the dragon
is<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.180> he<00:04:06.389> does<00:04:06.599> so<00:04:07.069> when<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.190> predict<00:04:08.489> tax

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
is and he does so when you predict tax

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.180 
is and he does so when you predict tax

world so uh what's going on here i think

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.420

feraligatr and that's gonna be that so

feraligatr and that's gonna be that so
uh<00:04:58.370> i<00:04:59.750> would<00:05:00.750> think<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:03.229> paralysis

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
uh i would think that the paralysis

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.680 
uh i would think that the paralysis
wasn't<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.220> big<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:05.940> deal<00:05:06.150> because<00:05:06.449> i

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
wasn't that big of a deal because i

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.570 
wasn't that big of a deal because i
could<00:05:06.900> have<00:05:06.990> lived<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.380> hit<00:05:07.949> that<00:05:08.190> wasn't<00:05:08.490> like

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
could have lived a hit that wasn't like

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.980 
could have lived a hit that wasn't like
a<00:05:08.610> funder<00:05:09.090> like<00:05:09.389> I<00:05:09.509> don't<00:05:09.570> know<00:05:09.690> if<00:05:09.810> he<00:05:09.900> would

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
a funder like I don't know if he would

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.740 
a funder like I don't know if he would
have<00:05:10.139> thunder<00:05:10.500> but<00:05:10.970> if<00:05:11.970> he<00:05:12.419> didn't<00:05:12.690> have

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
have thunder but if he didn't have

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.659 
have thunder but if he didn't have
thunder<00:05:13.139> probably<00:05:14.039> could<00:05:14.190> have<00:05:14.220> lived<00:05:14.430> any

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
thunder probably could have lived any

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.689 
thunder probably could have lived any
hit<00:05:14.910> even<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.470> double<00:05:16.470> edge<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:19.160> drag<00:05:20.160> enhanced

hit even a double edge and drag enhanced

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.969 
hit even a double edge and drag enhanced
and<00:05:20.910> such<00:05:21.860> but<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.220> leaf<00:05:23.639> storm<00:05:23.970> was<00:05:24.330> kind<00:05:24.780> of

and such but the leaf storm was kind of

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.370
