00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
you need to dive underwater and you need

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.330 
you need to dive underwater and you need

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
to go into a cave and then rise to the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.010 
to go into a cave and then rise to the
main<00:01:07.340> water<00:01:07.579> level<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.329> then<00:01:08.509> you're<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.869> a

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
main water level and then you're in a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
main water level and then you're in a
actually<00:01:09.740> in<00:01:10.090> sootopolis<00:01:11.090> city<00:01:11.329> so<00:01:11.960> seeing<00:01:12.799> as

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
actually in sootopolis city so seeing as

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.200 
actually in sootopolis city so seeing as
ludicrous<00:01:13.400> is<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.060> only<00:01:14.210> one<00:01:14.540> who<00:01:14.689> can<00:01:14.900> learn

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
ludicrous is the only one who can learn

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.569 
ludicrous is the only one who can learn
dive<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.450> think<00:01:17.720> I'll<00:01:17.869> replace<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.530> awful<00:01:19.130> fury

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
dive I think I'll replace the awful fury

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.609 
dive I think I'll replace the awful fury
swipes<00:01:19.789> attack<00:01:20.450> because<00:01:20.960> fluorine<00:01:21.350> swipes

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
swipes attack because fluorine swipes

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.059 
swipes attack because fluorine swipes
never<00:01:21.979> does<00:01:22.189> any<00:01:22.369> good<00:01:22.869> again<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.140> real<00:01:24.469> bowels

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
never does any good again in real bowels

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:27.969 
never does any good again in real bowels
because<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.119> only<00:01:26.450> ever<00:01:26.749> slightly<00:01:27.530> good<00:01:27.740> if

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
because it's only ever slightly good if

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.309 
because it's only ever slightly good if
it<00:01:29.229> strikes<00:01:30.229> five<00:01:31.009> times<00:01:31.429> but<00:01:32.109> even<00:01:33.109> then

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
it strikes five times but even then

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.319 
it strikes five times but even then
that's<00:01:33.619> not<00:01:33.920> much<00:01:35.170> damage<00:01:36.170> done<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.799> the

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
that's not much damage done to the

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.800 
that's not much damage done to the
opposing<00:01:38.329> Pokemon<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:39.969> just<00:01:40.969> heal<00:01:41.329> my<00:01:41.569> Pokemon

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
opposing Pokemon I just heal my Pokemon

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.730 
opposing Pokemon I just heal my Pokemon
up<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.499> then<00:01:42.889> I<00:01:43.159> think<00:01:43.429> I'll<00:01:44.049> go<00:01:45.049> over<00:01:45.499> to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
up and then I think I'll go over to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.059 
up and then I think I'll go over to
sootopolis<00:01:46.729> city<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:47.719> we<00:01:47.929> mean<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.740> won't<00:01:48.920> be

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
sootopolis city so we mean it won't be

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.160 
sootopolis city so we mean it won't be
battling<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.880> gym<00:01:50.119> yet<00:01:50.359> because<00:01:50.840> it's

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
battling the gym yet because it's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.349 
battling the gym yet because it's
actually<00:01:51.619> not<00:01:51.770> possible<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.729> can't<00:01:52.999> get<00:01:53.240> in

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
actually not possible you can't get in

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.359 
actually not possible you can't get in
the<00:01:53.450> gym<00:01:53.659> until<00:01:53.950> we<00:01:54.950> do<00:01:55.520> something<00:01:56.920> but<00:01:57.920> um<00:01:58.100> I

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
the gym until we do something but um I

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.769 
the gym until we do something but um I
think<00:01:59.139> I'll<00:02:00.139> go<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:01.159> sootopolis<00:02:01.850> city<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.659> we

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
think I'll go to sootopolis city so we

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:06.879 
think I'll go to sootopolis city so we
can<00:02:02.959> fly<00:02:03.289> there<00:02:03.619> when<00:02:04.429> we<00:02:04.729> need<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:04.999> I'll<00:02:05.990> just

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
can fly there when we need to I'll just

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:10.160

quite<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> few<00:02:11.290> of<00:02:11.560> each<00:02:11.790> spend<00:02:13.200> almost<00:02:14.200> all<00:02:14.560> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
quite a few of each spend almost all the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:03:07.590 
quite a few of each spend almost all the
money<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.519> got<00:02:16.090> from<00:02:17.310> all<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.579> battles<00:02:18.970> on

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.320 

so<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:09.050> get<00:03:09.200> sootopolis<00:03:09.860> city<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:11.060> here
