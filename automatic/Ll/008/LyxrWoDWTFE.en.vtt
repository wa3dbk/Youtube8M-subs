00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
pricey and was supposed to be the best

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.380 
pricey and was supposed to be the best
well<00:00:34.769> I've<00:00:35.010> had<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.339> lot<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.580> toilets<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> I

well I've had a lot of toilets and I
could<00:00:36.600> tell<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.900> this<00:00:37.049> is<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.650> best<00:00:37.890> well

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
could tell you this is not the best well

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.640 
could tell you this is not the best well
it<00:00:38.850> flushes<00:00:39.330> fine<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.019> sides<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
it flushes fine but the sides of the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.399 
it flushes fine but the sides of the
bowl<00:00:40.830> were<00:00:40.979> rough<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.720> where<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:42.900> below<00:00:43.229> the

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
bowl were rough and where the below the

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.770 
bowl were rough and where the below the
waterline<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.220> smooth<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.909> I<00:00:45.360> thought<00:00:45.659> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
waterline it's smooth and I thought it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
waterline it's smooth and I thought it
was<00:00:45.900> a<00:00:45.930> museum<00:00:46.379> buildup<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.369> it's<00:00:47.519> not

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
was a museum buildup you know it's not

that old but all the scrubbing in the
world<00:00:50.040> it<00:00:50.339> still<00:00:50.549> left<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.970> sides<00:00:51.269> rough<00:00:51.659> so

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
world it still left the sides rough so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.960
