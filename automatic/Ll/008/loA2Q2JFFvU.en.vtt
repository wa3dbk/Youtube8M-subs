really crazy race a lot of drivers are
coming<00:00:56.960> not<00:00:57.290> just<00:00:57.740> from<00:00:58.220> Europe<00:00:58.880> you<00:00:58.910> know

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
coming not just from Europe you know

coming not just from Europe you know
they<00:00:59.330> are<00:00:59.390> coming<00:00:59.570> from<00:00:59.810> all<00:01:00.020> over<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:00.350> world

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.500 

some<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.250> drivers<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.730> first<00:01:04.970> time<00:01:05.180> here

so<00:01:05.720> I<00:01:05.930> think<00:01:06.310> it's<00:01:07.310> kind<00:01:07.550> of<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.730> good

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
so I think it's kind of a good

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.150 
so I think it's kind of a good
combination<00:01:08.260> it's<00:01:09.260> very<00:01:09.530> challenging<00:01:09.740> for

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
combination it's very challenging for

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.820 
combination it's very challenging for
them

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.940 

so<00:01:13.520> enormous<00:01:13.910> spread<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.480> cars<00:01:14.720> drivers<00:01:15.140> los

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
so enormous spread of cars drivers los

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.660 

we're<00:03:13.560> pretty<00:03:13.710> confident<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> car<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.520> going

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
we're pretty confident the car is going

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.190 
we're pretty confident the car is going
to<00:03:14.760> perform<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> cars<00:03:15.840> car

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
to perform and the cars car

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.720 
to perform and the cars car
well-balanced<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.160> we<00:03:17.250> will<00:03:17.520> have<00:03:17.670> a

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
well-balanced I think we will have a

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.190 
well-balanced I think we will have a
good<00:03:17.940> race<00:03:19.100> do<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.130> go<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> our<00:03:21.000> first<00:03:21.570> priority

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
good race do I go to our first priority

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470 
good race do I go to our first priority
is<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.560> finish<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.100> race<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.550> take<00:03:24.240> care<00:03:24.420> of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
is to finish the race and take care of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:51.740 
is to finish the race and take care of
the<00:03:24.600> car<00:03:27.560> they<00:03:49.880> go<00:03:50.880> anywhere<00:03:51.000> at<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.480> point

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
the car they go anywhere at that point

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.060 
the car they go anywhere at that point
already<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.220> apex<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:54.770> think<00:03:55.770> I<00:03:55.860> passed

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
already on the apex I think I passed

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.580 
already on the apex I think I passed
about<00:03:56.460> six<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.630> photos<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.320> first

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
about six of the photos in the first

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.430 
about six of the photos in the first
love

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.040 

so<00:04:03.100> really<00:04:03.280> really<00:04:03.400> good<00:04:03.640> stint<00:04:03.970> actually<00:04:04.300> no

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
so really really good stint actually no

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.630 
so really really good stint actually no
problems<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.890> balance<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.250> cars<00:04:06.460> really

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
problems and the balance the cars really

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.300 
problems and the balance the cars really
good<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.840> makes<00:04:07.990> posters<00:04:08.410> sort<00:04:09.130> of<00:04:09.190> your

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
good that makes posters sort of your

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.130 
good that makes posters sort of your
piety<00:04:09.520> through<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.000> corners<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.960> can

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
piety through the corners so you can

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.390 
piety through the corners so you can
really<00:04:11.590> lean<00:04:11.740> on<00:04:11.770> it<00:04:11.950> through<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.130> corners

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
really lean on it through the corners

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.610 
really lean on it through the corners
passed<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.330> couple<00:04:13.480> of<00:04:13.570> cars<00:04:13.810> from<00:04:13.990> our<00:04:14.080> class

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
passed a couple of cars from our class

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.390 
passed a couple of cars from our class
I<00:04:16.290> guess<00:04:17.290> Harlech<00:04:17.650> isn't<00:04:17.860> it<00:04:17.920> the<00:04:18.010> next<00:04:18.250> things

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
I guess Harlech isn't it the next things

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.560 
I guess Harlech isn't it the next things
going<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.610> be<00:04:18.670> in<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.790> dark<00:04:18.970> that's<00:04:19.299> a<00:04:19.390> whole
