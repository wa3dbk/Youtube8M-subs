00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.510 

so<00:00:12.410> this<00:00:12.590> is<00:00:12.710> going<00:00:12.920> to<00:00:12.980> be<00:00:14.110> fully<00:00:15.160> how<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.220> use

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
so this is going to be fully how to use

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.790 
so this is going to be fully how to use
the<00:00:16.760> universal<00:00:17.420> pulse<00:00:17.750> that<00:00:18.230> you<00:00:18.350> gain<00:00:18.560> from

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
the universal pulse that you gain from

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.570 
the universal pulse that you gain from
standing<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:19.790> the<00:00:20.630> Tai<00:00:21.050> Chi<00:00:21.080> exercises<00:00:21.580> for

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
standing and the Tai Chi exercises for

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.090 
standing and the Tai Chi exercises for
self-defense<00:00:23.860> universal<00:00:24.860> pulse<00:00:25.070> being<00:00:25.779> the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
self-defense universal pulse being the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.680 
self-defense universal pulse being the
expansion<00:00:28.100> and<00:00:28.340> condensation<00:00:29.030> of<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.360> body

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
expansion and condensation of the body

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.299 
expansion and condensation of the body
and<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.050> breath

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.389 

when<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.669> happening<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> natural<00:00:33.750> manner

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
when it is happening in a natural manner

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:46.369 
when it is happening in a natural manner
when<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.760> trying<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.979 

should<00:00:47.379> say<00:00:47.589> inhale<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:49.120> exhale

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
should say inhale and exhale

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.750 
should say inhale and exhale
but<00:00:50.350> here<00:00:50.589> we're<00:00:50.710> not<00:00:50.799> concentrating<00:00:51.519> on<00:00:51.640> the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
but here we're not concentrating on the

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.430 
but here we're not concentrating on the
breath<00:00:51.969> selection<00:00:52.600> as<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.850> contraction<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
breath selection as the contraction and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.310 
breath selection as the contraction and
expansion<00:00:57.189> really<00:00:58.079> condensation<00:00:59.079> rather

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
expansion really condensation rather

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.219 
expansion really condensation rather
than<00:00:59.559> contraction<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.609> density<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.809> learn

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
than contraction and density so to learn

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.249 
than contraction and density so to learn
that<00:01:02.439> I'll<00:01:02.979> have<00:01:03.129> Brock<00:01:03.430> put<00:01:03.729> a<00:01:04.000> punch<00:01:04.330> on<00:01:05.080> my

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
that I'll have Brock put a punch on my

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.990 
that I'll have Brock put a punch on my
arm<00:01:05.470> here<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:08.439> will<00:01:08.649> just<00:01:08.860> be<00:01:09.039> to<00:01:09.369> show<00:01:09.610> what

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
arm here this will just be to show what

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.800 
arm here this will just be to show what
is<00:01:10.119> going<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.360> happen<00:01:10.539> with<00:01:10.840> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is going to happen with that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:36.940 
is going to happen with that
so<00:01:13.810> first<00:01:14.080> very<00:01:14.409> slowly

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.550 

so<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:38.330> next<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:38.720> we<00:01:38.810> can<00:01:38.960> think<00:01:39.140> of<00:01:39.290> brush

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
so the next one we can think of brush

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:53.550 
so the next one we can think of brush
knee<00:01:40.990> having<00:01:41.990> position

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.050 

now<00:01:54.560> naturally<00:01:54.980> you're<00:01:55.130> coming<00:01:55.400> here<00:01:55.580> waiting

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
now naturally you're coming here waiting

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:16.240 
now naturally you're coming here waiting
and<00:01:56.150> passed<00:01:56.420> your<00:01:56.630> body

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.260 

lady<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.030> shuttle<00:02:18.640> as<00:02:19.640> supply<00:02:20.000> has

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
lady with the shuttle as supply has

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.660 
lady with the shuttle as supply has
followed

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.250 

this<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.790> against<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.240> shoppers<00:02:28.810> chopping

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
this is against the shoppers chopping

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.710 
this is against the shoppers chopping
down<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.760> what<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.300> do

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
down so what do I do

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:52.170 
down so what do I do
I<00:02:32.130> yield<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:33.670> chop

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:30.979 

can<00:02:52.299> be<00:02:52.450> done<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:53.019> same<00:02:53.079> way

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.760 

you<00:03:31.989> can<00:03:32.170> get

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.560 

you're<00:03:39.430> flying<00:03:41.220> here<00:03:42.220> if<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.180> come<00:03:43.390> at<00:03:43.540> me

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
you're flying here if you come at me

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:52.550 
you're flying here if you come at me
slowly<00:03:43.960> here<00:03:46.080> let<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> body<00:03:47.530> here

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.950 

the<00:03:52.950> energy<00:03:53.250> splits<00:03:53.640> browse<00:03:54.300> through<00:03:54.600> my<00:03:54.660> back

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
the energy splits browse through my back

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.280 
the energy splits browse through my back
comes<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.950> young<00:03:56.160> house<00:03:56.750> as<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.810> separate

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
comes to the young house as a separate

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:14.270 
comes to the young house as a separate
channel<00:03:58.590> grouse<00:03:58.860> eggs<00:04:02.660> coming<00:04:03.660> apart<00:04:13.100> this<00:04:14.100> is

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
channel grouse eggs coming apart this is

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.760 
channel grouse eggs coming apart this is
the<00:04:14.370> basic<00:04:14.670> idea
