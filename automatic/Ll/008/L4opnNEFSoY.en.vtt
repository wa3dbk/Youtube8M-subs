00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.450
 believe that we have 420 pockets of you that is 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 skills 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:24.990
 news 30 degrees a little bit 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.599
 more well, in general, 30 degrees and what 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 stand here I remember how long fast 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.840
 the space rocked there was n't any 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.390
 tasks sharpen it very well just 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.390
 he enrolled for what helped sharpened 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:01:41.450
 let's go win 30 counted wrong 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.850
 Well, I donâ€™t know honestly; 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.399
 how very conclusion is super 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.270
 abrasive 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.270
 me this charging, charging 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:02.670
 how exactly build dough around it 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:48.850
 well, let's finish this, then we'll see 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:03:05.170
 the next material here is also 30 by 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:03:12.000
 This keratin sausage of that 60 probably 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:15.640
 worth future tests and through a piece of paper and 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.830
 cuts but I'm already feeling here 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.140
 some problem that is the very first 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:04:09.040
 cutting a billion is easier 1 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:04:16.350
 let's 4 5 6 9 4 5 6 5 6 10 well yes let 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.350
 the last 30 g many half a meter fight 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.769
 this one just want a piece of wood 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.690
 let's look at the piece of paper 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:45.630
 I clearly and flooding well return yes and 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.320
 by analogy stark that is certainly cut 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.690
 a piece of paper and of course I am for a piece of paper 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.229
 maybe give us some insight 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.479
 process better but I do not know yet 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.300
 salt 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:03.449
 I suggested that in what is possible 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:07.949
 the problem of felt in this particular 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.610
 format maybe it will be like when you 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.130
 hold on 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.710
 He is bursting yes that is here it is 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.770
 entered the material and then no longer 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.930
 Depending why stupid not stupid knife he 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.560
 it just smacks we would be pushing 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.280
 bewitch about or 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.870
 I somehow think that this is not so let's 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.009
 still try somehow neatly 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.009
 blunt click 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:46.970
 it is so super how to develop 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.250
 need a little bit there she will sharpen 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:57.540
 look at what is here now 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:06:02.700
 sound azuna knife brain is not all dull 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:06.110
 knife I knew he was supposed to cut in 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.110
 such a decay 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:19.590
 no, he enters it a little bit but it 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:22.260
 all that is about no separation 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.090
 speech material does not go that this one 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:32.850
 the moment of me is still complex 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.950
 It turned out 3 390 cuts 420 carbon bar on 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.910
 goji is all bye search I think in 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.290
 next test we will start going through 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.820
 paper some amount to cut paper 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.420
 5 4 teeth 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.090
 thereby determining some degree 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.870
 landing became thanks for watching 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.870
 fight and bye
