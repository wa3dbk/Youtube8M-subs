 soldiers at banias van hamme at montamat 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.640
 the local guyane ej raum in the jersey but 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.210
 yaya diallo alpha but let's get menad to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 Charles G and the delegation 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 what is good is that each player 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.420
 and can apply imposes holders 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.140
 and that's a good thing for 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.269
 the National team 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.430
 in any case they made good matches 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.710
 we took two goals by the purpose of 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.269
 penalty but frankly they were 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.190
 solid 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.110
 our way I'm behind them I 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.699
 encouraged me when I play that behind 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.809
 me too so that's it 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.040
 team have to keep this help is 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.890
 Strict matches are important 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.989
 these three points in addition it is false must 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.549
 win it to get a little closer 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.190
 of qualification for the lack of 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:09.250
 lawyer chabannes and his adapted ballads 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:12.600
 to the sick but never we have to try 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.509
 of always difficult have learned that they 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 are well prepared are known 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.950
 conditions so I think that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.000
 we have all the means to go win 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.130
 to have low it's going to be a 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.650
 we will say for these two matches we 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.870
 will try to take the six points on 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.729
 are we going to focus well we're fine 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.380
 mobilize team there is able to 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.979
 all because they are used to the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.000
 heat and that's the case anyway 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.010
 put in the head this is very hard to 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.619
 down summers would make his yard is everywhere 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.060
 he was not afraid of heat I think 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.290
 even the synthetic ground there goes 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.350
 to be in their favor because they have 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.700
 the habit of playing on it and not in 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.690
 Africa is always hard when you play 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.010
 there you have the impression that it is 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.580
 it's a great team because they 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.720
 are used to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 they are in theirs in their 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.100
 environment of their condition we 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.710
 is not used to that but we have 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.810
 proved that we are champions we have made 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.340
 a big one a big progress especially 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.509
 also at Benin last year at the month 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.130
 from june two years ago to june 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.970
 I think that Algeria adventure is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.679
 when you play there you have the impression 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.340
 that it's a big team because 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.479
 they are used to 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.580
 they are in theirs in their 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.770
 environment of their condition 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.470
 we are not used to that but we 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.600
 proved that we and shopi we did we did 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.100
 a big one a big progress especially 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.270
 also at Benin last year at the month 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:32.340
 from june two years ago to june 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:32.340
 I think that manage it has progressed all 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.110
 as bastien lasne and I send it 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.760
 tried to choose him if they have to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.959
 choose France will choose but I 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400
 sense that he will choose Algeria but 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.630
 must be patient must be patient 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.000
 because he still remains young do not have to 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.500
 forget that maybe his club puts him 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.400
 the pressure I do not know I do not know so 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.829
 I can not talk to me anyway 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.510
 must be patient with him and listened to him 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.220
 by mouth before listening to people from 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.110
 1st day of the playoffs of the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.579
 africa cup of nations algeria 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.560
 is simply leading the group b 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.959
 with six points the double confrontation 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.370
 facing malawi on October 11 and 15 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.930
 next could allow the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.239
 national selection in case of victory 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.470
 to put both feet in Morocco the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.940
 national coach christian 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.620
 Gourcuff today animated a 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.480
 press conference at the hall of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620
 conference of the olympic complex mohamed 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.329
 algerian boudiaf 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.579
 for him the goal is to ensure the 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.630
 qualification to CAN 2015 of all 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.940
 matches so we play to win them 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.980
 so we have another 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.150
 I hate and even if we take into account 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.470
 characteristics of the opponent we are going 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.870
 not change our our game plan 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.670
 so we go first to malawi for 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.900
 impose our game after of course there is 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.880
 match conditions that make one 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.890
 is not my sometimes it is necessary to undergo 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.690
 but it's ambition to impose 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.340
 our game and this will be the case in malawi and 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.570
 this will be the case later also so that 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.670
 it's a philosophy that I would have 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.210
 as long as I'm here and even 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.650
 elsewhere so that's it's very clear 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.880
 now actually there is also a 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.620
 opponent who wants him to play 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.520
 a few times and if we do not do 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.830
 always what we want but in any case 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.260
 we have the ambition to play to win 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.760
 in malawi three players were 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.920
 also present and yacine brahimi 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.700
 jamal is not it and mohamed lamine 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.380
 Zemmamouche 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.150
 the atmosphere in the group is good 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.250
 fixed and the players are determined to 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.550
 pocket the three points in malawi on 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.720
 must be a great match even if we 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.800
 know that it's going to be very complicated 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.300
 to go and win there 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.150
 but in any case we have the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.430
 determination and will put them all 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.850
 our side to try to achieve a 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.980
 good match and a win there for 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.950
 maize movements is clear that 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.840
 now 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.750
 we have enough experience and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.800
 and craft to go there and 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.690
 report the three points 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.100
 it's clear that in the years 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.770
 previous and previous parts 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.110
 we have proved that we can win at 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190
 outside after 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.580
 I think it's going to be a match 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.200
 totally different from that of hopis 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.810
 because we are going to play on a synthetic 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.100
 years there will be a little heat so the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.040
 conditions they are not going to be very 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.920
 favorable for us but I think we 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.870
 has the abilities and the experience and also 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.080
 the potential to bring back the three 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.640
 points 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.120
 after it's clear it'll be difficult 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.980
 but anyway we are getting ready for 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.870
 this match the national coach 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.300
 christian gourcuff appealed to 24 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.250
 players the French technician has everything 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.630
 simply renew his confidence in 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.130
 practically the whole group that had 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.810
 took part in the first two matches of 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.880
 playoffs ended in two wins 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.450
 on the terrain of busan ethiopia and 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.450
 to normal 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.970
 statistics show that as a 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.810
 friend or a are difficult to maneuver 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:51.190
 on their synthetic pitch 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.770
 I'm also used to it since 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.730
 I have been in Lorient since many 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.070
 years we had a synthetic pitch 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:02.700
 so I called not the rules and 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.670
 the constraints imposed by such a terrain 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.970
 the stars of the mission ghana as 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:12.249
 impressive obviously not what will it be 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.919
 will need to be better level for 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:16.779
 our malawi dress she takes off amy 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:22.389
 winehouse dhabi nina world and wireless 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:32.919
 wi fi of the kabardino she left 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:34.809
 Tuesday launched the rebellion even Béchard 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.549
 so says wattao shut down one of 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.439
 afld members and alain year 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:42.149
 second green mate is originally at 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:44.769
 a royal enemy attack is like that 

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:47.319
 regarding the bile these games the 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:50.349
 to meet in Lyon in august 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:51.399
 people so d so it's not it's not 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.439
 again I knew his qualities 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.929
 since before that really imposes itself 

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:58.199
 with lyon so we had already 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:02.169
 discussed that about his situation 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:04.299
 here I have been on the phone regularly 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.610
 since the good I would say that the ball 

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:09.099
 is in his camp as it is 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.249
 it's a choice that's personal so we 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:14.049
 this is not about the influenced will be on 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:18.029
 his choices he knows all the 

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:20.199
 data and then after that's right there 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:21.579
 I think he's in a situation a 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:22.959
 little a little difficult it is in 

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:24.579
 doubt to choose good but requires that 

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:26.860
 turns off to him to make the choices 

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:30.089
 knowing that we can not stay between 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.089
 two for too long
