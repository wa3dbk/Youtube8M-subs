very<00:00:22.769> difficult<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.850> anything<00:00:24.439> now<00:00:25.439> this

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
very difficult to see anything now this

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.759 
very difficult to see anything now this
area<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.279> filled<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.849> light<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.769> it's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
area is filled with light and it's

area is filled with light and it's
filled<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.220> light<00:00:29.429> because<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.789> finally

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
filled with light because I finally

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.959 
filled with light because I finally
found<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.900> workable<00:00:31.289> solution<00:00:31.610> I've<00:00:32.610> tried

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
found a workable solution I've tried

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
found a workable solution I've tried
many<00:00:33.239> over<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.600> years<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
many over the years but the one that

lineal feet or you can wrap it around
all<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.150> lighting<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.320> let's<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> look

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.810 

this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> lighting<00:01:32.729> strips<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.530> a

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
this is one of the lighting strips of a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
this is one of the lighting strips of a
unit<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.939> I've<00:01:36.030> already<00:01:36.240> opened<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.049> you'll

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
unit that I've already opened and you'll

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.270 
unit that I've already opened and you'll
see<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.159> connector<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.280> flexible

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
see the connector with the flexible

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
see the connector with the flexible
light<00:01:41.460> strip<00:01:41.729> ends<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
light strip ends this is one of the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.660 
light strip ends this is one of the
lights<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:45.590> let's<00:01:46.590> take<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> look<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
backing of the strip of lights

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.999 
backing of the strip of lights
they<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.970> tape<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
they have tape on the back so that you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.950 
they have tape on the back so that you
can<00:01:53.159> fill<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> tape<00:01:53.700> off<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.240> adhere<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> a

to white and show you that you can turn

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.850 
to white and show you that you can turn
down<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.410> intensity<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> lighting<00:03:05.670> and

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.300 

as<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:24.060> solution<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:25.110> an<00:03:25.440> under<00:03:25.739> counter<00:03:25.890> work

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
as a solution for an under counter work

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.940 
as a solution for an under counter work
area<00:03:26.790> or<00:03:26.970> any<00:03:27.780> type<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.049> ambient<00:03:28.709> lighting

this<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.000> absolutely<00:03:30.810> perfect<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.590> once<00:03:32.190> again

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
this is absolutely perfect so once again

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.069 
this is absolutely perfect so once again
here<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.329> have<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:34.320> mosaic<00:03:35.900> flexible<00:03:36.900> light

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
here you have the mosaic flexible light

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.580 
here you have the mosaic flexible light
system<00:03:37.560> by<00:03:38.040> Sylvania<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:39.170> this<00:03:40.170> was<00:03:40.350> picked

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
system by Sylvania and this was picked

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.580 
system by Sylvania and this was picked
up<00:03:40.739> at<00:03:40.920> Costco<00:03:41.519> for<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.390> believe<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> range<00:03:43.260> of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
up at Costco for I believe a range of
