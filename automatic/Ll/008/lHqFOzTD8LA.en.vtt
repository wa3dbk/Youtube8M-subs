00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 Yes, this is a Komatsu washing machine, but a sufficient amount of water is needed 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:28.360
 Booby theory Kedomo I know if i child say is that clean water 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:31.450
 as so no water fore 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:41.620
 How long ate 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:42.970
 I will answer when you explain this faucet here 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.930
 We explain easily 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.380
 I can only see Chorochoro I enter intermittently 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.940
 Say that water is out 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.380
 It feels like this You can't use it for a while, so remember it 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.340
 I would like 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.690
 Other than the fact that water comes from the head water supply 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:09.240
 Besides supplying water from the water supply to the high-pressure washer Garr 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.570
 Because there is also a model that you can suck up yourself, for example, these two places are lined up 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.400
 You It is also in relation to this side of the model but de 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.990
 a Suction of water should be right 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:25.150
 I There is respect here of models that can not be if the water for you to shore 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:29.630
 Because it can suck up water, it's also about sucking up water 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.409
 Optional accessories will always be required 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.409
 It is for taking in water Intake of water 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 After a 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.350
 It is dedicated hose around to suck up mer was ear child 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.409
 It is +9 in filter 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.940
 If there is any impurities in the water, then 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:57.740
 Basically I tell the manufacturer how to prevent the filter from entering the body 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.740
 Chu Innovation Although the specification will change and you come to need the basic of the three 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:09.119
 In use of the two little container of the case saying that suck up the case is it well for water of water supply 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.640
 I did, but this little bucket 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.130
 If this is the capacity is 10 liters 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:23.560
 Because high pressure washers basically use 5 liters to 6 liters of water per minute 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:27.030
 It's one more of the more will come near that's bucket of 10 liters in about 2 minutes 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.370
 This barrel It is the capacity that I went 62 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.980
 Is an attempt to Suiageyo Well 5-liter Te ne 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.340
 It will be in the form of already sucking up in about 12 minutes 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.410
 It's just 12 minutes and I feel like it's so short 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.250
 It is recommended to do it for 12 minutes, as it is surprising 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.550
 It would be nice if you could buy something about 60 liters 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.330
 If it is only a little, I can use this 10 liter bucket already 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.180
 But also 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.680
 Well say when the Fu that fairly short because Well, about 61 units of barrels wonder if recommended 2 minutes 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.219
 Do you think 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:10.030
 As for water, this is the connection method 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:11.590
 Because there are many tips for sucking up the water, and those who struggle with this 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.510
 Even though it's often 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 If it is our shop, this is good separately 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.040
 Since we offer a video that describes in detail tricks your description with respect to bone in the way of there 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.189
 I think that I want to do it 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.500
 Yes after all it is new 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:33.129
 May be asked to contact us it is the person that some, such as water coming out from the main body something 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.840
 I will 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.990
 It is just a new one with regard to the washing machine right now 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.850
 is not it 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.960
 (2) Since we are testing water, it is possible that water may come out of the main unit even in new 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.500
 I will 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:52.550
 The buy in other stores even if this is gotten bought Well our store the same in any manufacturer 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.840
 Which manufacturer do you buy 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:00.430
 There is nothing to talk about what is supposed to be a water flow case 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.030
 That's why I 'm never neh ah but of course I'm selling used items 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:08.190
 As we never sell things we used once, 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.190
 Yes I would like to be relieved about that point
