00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.890
 for this test what we will do will be 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.480
 we have to create an application that what 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.719
 will do once it is installed on 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.849
 phone will create a connection between the 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.639
 attacker machine and the phone the 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.050
 victim and will allow us to control the 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.760
 phone remotely this 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.970
 application that we have created we have 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.460
 posted on a web page and what 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.720
 what are we going to do now that I'll show you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 will access this web page 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.080
 now the application is here 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.080
 downloaded we explain 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.250
 here we have the permits you request 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.699
 the application we can see 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.600
 permits such as access permission 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.370
 gps that can read messages even 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.769
 that the application could reach 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.920
 generate costs is to say that we have to 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.479
 pay then according to what according to what actions 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.730
 makes the application worth then you 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.980
 we say install 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.040
 the app waking up and wants 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.860
 install on the phone the user open 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.580
 open the application and what will happen is 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.610
 the moment the application 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.040
 would disappear that is to say we already have a 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.610
 anomalous behavior that the user 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.190
 could not see normal the attacker now 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 may have access to perform the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.520
 actions with the phone for example what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.920
 What are they going to do now 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.260
 is 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.400
 get the sms 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.890
 that the one on the phone then 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.920
 we dump the sms 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.110
 and this is stored in a file of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.360
 text 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.360
 we can check that file 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.610
 and here we can see 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.820
 on what date 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.000
 we have made that dump 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.630
 what version of android is running on 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 phone and the sms 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 other things that we are going to do is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.599
 take photos without the user being 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.330
 realize of it therefore we are going to 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.330
 take out the phone to take a picture 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.510
 now they are focusing on me to do 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.510
 the photo is we throw the photo 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.480
 and here we have the result 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.160
 the photo has been made we can 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.590
 specify if the phone has a camera 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.959
 front also make a photo so that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.060
 the attacker knows who is the owner of the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.440
 phone too and another thing that we can 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.760
 do 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.950
 is to record with the microphone of the phone without 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.990
 that nobody knows that way you do not 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.240
 we can leave the phone sometime that 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.940
 meeting is like you do not want the thing and 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.880
 you can see the conversation remotely 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.610
 then let's put to record during 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.440
 10 seconds hello hello you make a 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.450
 test recording we will record a 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.450
 organization without anyone hearing us 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.510
 and we could record with the phone 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.000
 remote what measures we could apply 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.520
 to avoid this because then then 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.860
 let's say electronic by applying a 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.620
 lock password for someone 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.870
 I can not easily take it 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.920
 we get to praise something without you 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.540
 common sense consent and those are 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.930
 some of the regulations that are 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.930
 can follow
