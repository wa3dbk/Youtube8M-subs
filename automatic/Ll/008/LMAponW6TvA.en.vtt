 hello guys how are you welcome to this 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.390
 new video a video that I want to make you 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.430
 more than anything for those users who 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.130
 we have been told that it can be seen 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.610
 something more than a simple sun or a halo 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.500
 solar 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.289
 this in yesterday's video that we have 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.900
 uploaded by the amazing solar halo in 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.200
 the city of mexico happened yesterday 21 of 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.020
 May 2015 we want to clarify that the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.890
 photographs and videos that we have 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.260
 put in this edition 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.860
 are photographs and videos sent by 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.960
 users who live in mexico we do not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.800
 We are in Mexico , therefore 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.410
 they have sent them to us 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.390
 after receiving those messages 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.579
 we have come back to see the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.920
 video since 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.289
 we have not noticed since then 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.589
 until we receive those comments 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:01.690
 and if you can appreciate something more than a 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:07.030
 sun and something more than a solar halo 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:10.000
 in this video you can appreciate here is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.740
 like an orange medium out there but 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.900
 we can not know if this is the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.520
 moon or is something else we do not know if the moon 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.600
 at that time I was there so if 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.380
 you dear user has some 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.320
 Other pictures please tell us if 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.330
 you can appreciate something there or if in your 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.930
 moment the moon where it can be 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.930
 good 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.150
 in this video you can also appreciate 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.630
 something that comes out 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.190
 and that comes back in, that is, we do not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.170
 we can 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.810
 neither ensure that it is a UFO 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 or from a different planet but if we can 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.350
 ensure that the images are real and 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.270
 that you can appreciate more than just 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.759
 halo and a sun 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.539
 as you can see here you can see something 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.539
 Orange 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 and I guess these are the reflections of 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 sun but this is what makes me see a 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.900
 Best little things 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.790
 I'm not sure if it 's the moon or it's something 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.719
 more than the moon 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.500
 so leave us a comment and tell us 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:26.109
 what do you think he would really give us 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.299
