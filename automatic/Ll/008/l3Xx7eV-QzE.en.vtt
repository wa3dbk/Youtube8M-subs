 germany hong kong japan singapore and the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.850
 United Kingdom- that's really surprising 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.870
 ear the day of release in one of

 the stores in london other data

 they had already booked more than 2 million 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.370
 of iphones and for the first three days 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.580
 already 5 million had been sold 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.050
 of 100 million devices are 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.100
 updated to the new operating system 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.040
 mobile ios 6 the demand for iphone 5 ha 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.259
 been superior to the initial offer and 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.810
 while most orders 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.940

 Friday , September 28 and in more than 100 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.170
 at the end of the year, however, some 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.660
 analysts stress that those 5 million 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 of devices sold do not meet or 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.140
 much less with expectations 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.330
 saved by the giant of the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.970
 computing ascend they have seen 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.270
 diminished and this is where we enter 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.890
 we the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.950
 and to make this clearer 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.530
 Let's recap a little the first 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.950
 evolution of the iphone brought two of the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.280

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.520

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.860
 second version of ios the iphone 3g 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.890
 He also renewed the physical aspect of 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.260
 phone the aluminum housing went to 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.520
 be lighter plastic and also more 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.830
 fragile the 16gb model also offered 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.250
 what was the first white version 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.490
 of the terminal one year later in January 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.820
 2009 an improved version was presented 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.220

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.070
 ram memory a photo camera with more 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.740
 resolution and auto-focus compass and little 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.260
 more of the same the millions of fans of 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.810
 apple had to wait 18 months 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.910
 until the next release 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.580
 announced in June 2010 a terminal 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.100
 completely renovated in aspect in 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.980
 hardware in system technology 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.840
 operating retina screen with double 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.470
 of resolution video in hd 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.180
 dual core processor the core 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.930
 multitasking etc the smartphone more 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.810
 fine to date the iphone 4 supposed 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.840
 a jump in every way and everything 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.709
 It was well after 16 months in October 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.799
 2011 apple released the fifth version of its 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.750
 phone the iphone 4s keeping the 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.730
 aspect of its predecessor although with 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.519
 new hardware features 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.170
 as software in fact it was siri the 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.769
 voice assistant the principal 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.440
 protagonist in addition to the new processor 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.220
 but what has changed with the new iphone 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.290
 5 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 good the screen is bigger is more 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.150
 thin and with a new processor in addition 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.010
 of some new toys but for 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.959
 make the new one a little more specific 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.200
 Apple smartphone has a chip 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.250
 a6 which is twice as fast as the a5 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.680
 of the iphone 4s is also the same 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.260
 twice as fast in the deployment of 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.020
 graphics the company has shown 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.880
 with some live exhibitions the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.100
 iphone 5 screen as was from 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.020
 wait is 4 inches more 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.710
 that of the previous versions of 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.440
 3.5 inches as expected 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.090
 4g technology also present in the 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.370
 latest version of ipad the new 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.130
 Apple smartphone will enjoy this 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.050
 capacity according to the company itself this 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.120
 type of networks will provide a 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.720
 faster connection than any wifi 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.570
 in the home the camera is 8 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.420
 megapixels with autofocus and detection 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.040
 facial the iphone 5 pretends to be a jump 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.470
 forward in photography 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.020
 done from mobiles like this has been 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.610
 patent at the event but it also 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.850
 can capture video and on high 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.710
 definition at 1080 pixels the connector is 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.860
 another of the novelties becomes more 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.540
 small and more manageable apple has also 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.180
 introduced some news of 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.310
 ios software as we already mentioned in 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.190
 its version 6 provides greater 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.220
 iPhone 5 capabilities but above all 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.430
 has highlighted the maps application with it 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.610
 the firm aims to replace google maps 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.280
 in fact, the pre-installed 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.170
 system is based on tun tun and owns 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.170
 Real- time traffic information 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.940
 however the first failures are not 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.410
 have made you wait and despite being one 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.570
 smart phones 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.610
 moment the iphone 5 still continues 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.060
 presenting imperfections in the design 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.770
 of his model and that 45% of those who 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.010
 they bought a unit in black 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.210
 they claim that it has scratches on the 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:05.460
 side part of its aluminum housing 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.560
 also in the anti scratch tests to 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.480
 which was submitted the iphone 5 to 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.060
 it seems that it has not gone well 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.430
 there are even some who showed serious 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.130
 complaints on social networks by the 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.370
 bubbles that appear when you tighten your fine 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:23.160
 and expensive other detail screen is that 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.770
 some users complain of flickers 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.350
 also on the screen so much that it seems 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.540
 Made in China and to make matters worse 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.250
 samsung has launched a campaign to 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.470
 discredit apple more 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.570
 specifically with his new galaxy s3 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.449
 that really makes you compete 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:44.879
 also it has a voice assistant 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:48.240
 from 8 to 4.8 inches 4g technology and 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:50.909
 much more but what do you think you think 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.710
 if steve jobs revived another one would die 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.689
 once to see everything that is happening to 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.520
 your company do you think the new 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.759
 apple administrators rushed 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.159
 for wanting to compete with samsung and more 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:05.159
 you still think that the new iphone 5 is 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:07.349
 really what was expected, leave me your 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:09.860
 comments and please do not forget to give 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:13.309
