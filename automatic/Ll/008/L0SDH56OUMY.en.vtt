00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
city streets around la live so it's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.979 
city streets around la live so it's
going<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.309> be<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.460> lot<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.670> tarmac<00:00:47.150> which<00:00:47.839> will

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
going to be a lot of tarmac which will

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.829 
going to be a lot of tarmac which will
make<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.199> cars<00:00:48.379> really<00:00:48.589> fast<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:50.120> think<00:00:50.629> you'll

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
make the cars really fast I think you'll

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.990 
make the cars really fast I think you'll
see<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.170> speed<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.620> these<00:00:51.739> cars<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.730> launch

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
see the speed of these cars the launch

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.460 
see the speed of these cars the launch
and<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:53.510> starts<00:00:53.870> going<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:54.140> be<00:00:54.230> more

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
and the starts going to be more

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.369 
and the starts going to be more
important<00:00:54.920> now<00:00:55.040> than<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.309> was<00:00:55.339> and<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:57.170> cars

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
important now than it was and the cars

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:58.840 
important now than it was and the cars
will<00:00:57.530> slide<00:00:57.769> around<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.159> lot<00:00:58.309> more<00:00:58.460> on<00:00:58.610> dirt

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
will slide around a lot more on dirt

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.820 
will slide around a lot more on dirt
because<00:00:59.089> the<00:00:59.360> setup<00:00:59.750> will<00:00:59.960> be<00:00:59.989> all<00:01:00.290> about<00:01:00.320> the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
because the setup will be all about the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.939 
because the setup will be all about the
pavement<00:01:01.390> I've<00:01:02.390> been<00:01:02.600> super<00:01:03.260> lucky<00:01:03.619> about

the last eight years the formula has

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.770 
the last eight years the formula has
been<00:01:48.860> both<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.700> know<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.970> TV<00:01:50.210> helped<00:01:50.659> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
been both you know the TV helped the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.200 
been both you know the TV helped the
racing<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.440> helped<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:52.340> know<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.460> certain

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
racing and helped you know a certain

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.810 
racing and helped you know a certain
branding<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.200> make<00:01:54.800> racing<00:01:55.130> possible<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.760> the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
branding to make racing possible and the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.140 
branding to make racing possible and the
racing<00:01:56.180> gave<00:01:57.049> credibility<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.040> TV<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.700> I

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
racing gave credibility to the TV and I

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.030 
racing gave credibility to the TV and I
think<00:01:59.390> both<00:01:59.690> kind<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.110> work<00:02:00.320> with<00:02:00.620> each<00:02:00.770> other

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
think both kind of work with each other

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.730 
think both kind of work with each other
so<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.640> like<00:02:02.180> them<00:02:02.360> both<00:02:02.390> for<00:02:02.840> me<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.170> core<00:02:03.500> is

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
so I like them both for me the core is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.710 
so I like them both for me the core is
motorsports<00:02:04.340> that's<00:02:04.729> what<00:02:05.000> I'm<00:02:05.360> in<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:05.690> for

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
motorsports that's what I'm in it for

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.990 
motorsports that's what I'm in it for
that's<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.229> reason<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.710> do<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.010> TV<00:02:07.340> frankly

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
that's the reason I do the TV frankly

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.199 
that's the reason I do the TV frankly
but<00:02:09.159> it's<00:02:10.159> hard<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.580> have<00:02:10.670> one<00:02:10.909> without<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
