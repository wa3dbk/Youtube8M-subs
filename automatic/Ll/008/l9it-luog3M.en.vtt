 that is how our cross was 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.590
 and I did 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.709
 other two layers decreasing the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.500
 two centimeters you can do the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.140
 layers that you want as well as you 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.370
 I comment two centimeters less and can 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.680
 do even the smallest one is going to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.629
 to be very pretty, very pretty 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.150
 for the top of our card we have 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:32.569
 here a square of 14 centimeters and what 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.109
 let's score 210 and 2 we have left 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.109
 the following way 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.349
 and to cut it we are going to cut 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.349
 only the left sides 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.380
 we are turning the lid 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.380
 the two corners 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.849
 and having it like that we're just going to cut 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.849
 a little triangular 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.599
 let's go around 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.770
 and we only double the part of the lines 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.090
 and weapons 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.450
 we put some adhesive on the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.450
 tabs 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.540
 m 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.740
 and so on until the four sides are finished 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.960
 to grab our card since 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.210
 we have our molds marked 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.910
 put the molds so that 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.330
 coincide in this way or if we do not 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.360
 we can set against so that at 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.930
 moment to open it is as one as 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.180
 a flower 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.180
 then we will place the sticker 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.519
 and we're going to put it that way against 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.810
 and the other layer is also going to put 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.810
