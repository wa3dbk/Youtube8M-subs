00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
be in a Compaq as if form and like a

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.080 
be in a Compaq as if form and like a
compressed<00:02:31.470> form<00:02:31.799> what<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.370> want<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.849> is

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
compressed form what you want to do is

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.580 
compressed form what you want to do is
you<00:02:33.420> want<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.599> right<00:02:33.780> click<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.260> extract

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you want to right click and extract

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.580 
you want to right click and extract
files<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.909> like<00:02:36.329> brings<00:02:36.659> it<00:02:36.810> into<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.079> folder

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
files this like brings it into a folder

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.339 
files this like brings it into a folder
so<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:38.459> easier<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.120> like<00:02:39.329> not<00:02:39.870> compressed

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
so it's easier it's like not compressed

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.670 
so it's easier it's like not compressed
it's<00:02:40.590> easier<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.250> emulator<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:43.230> process

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it's easier for the emulator to process

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.780 
it's easier for the emulator to process
so<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.790> up<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.530> find<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.739> folder<00:02:47.159> it<00:02:47.340> made<00:02:47.549> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
so go up and find the folder it made and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.349 
so go up and find the folder it made and
choose<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.959> game<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.669> papa

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.349 

and<00:02:54.359> here's<00:02:55.019> starfox<00:02:55.409> 64<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.209> go<00:02:57.299> to

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
and here's starfox 64 and you can go to

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.899 
and here's starfox 64 and you can go to
file<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:58.169> end<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.560> game<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:59.609> can<00:02:59.760> go<00:02:59.819> to

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
file and end the game you can go to

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.149 
file and end the game you can go to
system<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.299> reset<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.169> can<00:03:01.650> pause<00:03:01.829> I'm

gonna pause it so you don't have a

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.339 
gonna pause it so you don't have a
controller<00:03:05.519> so<00:03:06.030> what<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.139> go<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349
