00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
all right this is a 2009 kx250 SF that

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.150 
all right this is a 2009 kx250 SF that
we<00:00:06.210> have<00:00:06.330> done<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.899> two<00:00:07.379> brothers<00:00:07.560> exhaust

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
we have done the two brothers exhaust

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.700 
we have done the two brothers exhaust
and<00:00:08.849> we've<00:00:09.330> also<00:00:09.540> done<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.139> airbox

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
and we've also done the airbox

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.470 
and we've also done the airbox
modification<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.730> open<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.000> up<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.240> get<00:00:12.330> some

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
modification to open it up to get some

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.020 
modification to open it up to get some
more<00:00:12.570> airflow<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.799> then<00:00:13.920> also<00:00:14.160> rejected<00:00:15.000> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
more airflow and then also rejected the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150 
more airflow and then also rejected the
carburetor<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.230> aftermarket<00:00:16.680> needle

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
carburetor with the aftermarket needle

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.849 
carburetor with the aftermarket needle
as<00:00:17.250> well<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:18.630> still<00:00:18.960> work<00:00:19.350> quite<00:00:19.650> getting

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
as well and we still work quite getting

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.010 
as well and we still work quite getting
that<00:00:20.010> top<00:00:20.220> end<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.670> were<00:00:20.730> looking<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
that top end we were looking for that

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.929 
that top end we were looking for that
we're<00:00:22.230> used<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.859> all<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.340> 250<00:00:23.789> dirt

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
we're used to with all the 250 dirt

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.170 
we're used to with all the 250 dirt
bikes<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.359> things<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:26.150> one<00:00:27.150> thing

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
bikes and things like that and one thing

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
bikes and things like that and one thing
that's<00:00:27.570> always<00:00:27.720> been<00:00:27.930> known<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:28.529> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that's always been known is when you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
that's always been known is when you
increase<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.250> overlap<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:30.029> bit<00:00:30.210> on

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
increase your overlap a little bit on

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
increase your overlap a little bit on
your<00:00:30.599> cams<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.309> more<00:00:32.550> top<00:00:32.759> end

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
your cams that you get more top end

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
your cams that you get more top end
power<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:33.989> we're<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> show

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
power and so what we're going to show

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.740 
power and so what we're going to show
you<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.760> cam<00:00:36.000> mod<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.630> do

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you here is the cam mod that you can do

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
you here is the cam mod that you can do
on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> KX<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.920> order<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.180> little<00:00:39.450> bit

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
on the KX in order to get a little bit

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
on the KX in order to get a little bit
more<00:00:39.809> than<00:00:39.989> mid-range<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> topped<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.070> power

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
more than mid-range and topped in power

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
more than mid-range and topped in power
that<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> first<00:00:45.329> thing<00:00:45.510> we're

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
that we like so the first thing we're

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
that we like so the first thing we're
going<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.829> we'll<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.070> ahead<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.309> remove

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
going to do so we'll go ahead and remove

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
going to do so we'll go ahead and remove
the<00:00:47.969> plug<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.230> off<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.379> radiator<00:00:52.579> gets

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the plug in here off the radiator gets

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.720 
the plug in here off the radiator gets
that<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> road<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:57.949> then<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that out of the road and then just so we

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.099 
that out of the road and then just so we
don't<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> pull<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> whole<00:01:00.570> tensioner

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
don't have to pull the whole tensioner

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.630 
don't have to pull the whole tensioner
assembly<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.620> everything<00:01:01.859> else<00:01:02.070> out<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
assembly and everything else out and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.320 
assembly and everything else out and
mess<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.159> timing<00:01:05.159> chain<00:01:05.189> tension<00:01:05.760> we'll

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
mess with the timing chain tension we'll

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.620 
mess with the timing chain tension we'll
go<00:01:06.450> ahead<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.810> pull<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> bolt<00:01:07.860> out

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
go ahead and just pull the bolt out

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.359 
go ahead and just pull the bolt out
which<00:01:09.630> will<00:01:09.840> let<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> spring<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.159> will

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
which will let the spring out which will

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
which will let the spring out which will
keep<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.729> from<00:01:11.850> tensioning<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> chain<00:01:12.600> up

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
keep it from tensioning the chain up

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
keep it from tensioning the chain up
anymore<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.350> we'll<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.650> able<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> keep<00:01:14.159> our

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
anymore so we'll be able to keep our

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:27.200 
anymore so we'll be able to keep our
stock<00:01:15.030> tension<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.659> there

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.310 

the<00:01:28.210> first<00:01:28.450> thing<00:01:28.630> we'll<00:01:28.750> do<00:01:28.900> is<00:01:28.930> because<00:01:29.200> we

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
the first thing we'll do is because we

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.530 
the first thing we'll do is because we
need<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.560> have<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:30.009> bottom<00:01:30.700> bolt<00:01:30.939> out<00:01:31.150> first

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
need to have the bottom bolt out first

00:01:31.540 --> 00:02:05.710 
need to have the bottom bolt out first
we'll<00:01:32.500> go<00:01:32.619> ahead<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.890> turn<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:33.159> half<00:01:33.400> turn

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.170 

so<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:06.650> get<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.860> right<00:02:07.100> back<00:02:07.370> on<00:02:07.430> top<00:02:07.940> dead

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
so we get it right back on top dead

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.320 
so we get it right back on top dead
center<00:02:09.760> Jesus<00:02:10.760> right<00:02:11.390> there<00:02:12.970> you'll<00:02:13.970> notice

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
center Jesus right there you'll notice

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.620 
center Jesus right there you'll notice
you<00:02:14.660> have<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.200> intent<00:02:15.920> cam<00:02:16.160> all<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.360> tank

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
you have the intent cam all the in tank

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.290 
you have the intent cam all the in tank
lines<00:02:18.320> are<00:02:18.560> marked<00:02:18.800> up<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.850> also<00:02:20.000> in<00:02:20.210> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
lines are marked up and it's also in the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.570 
lines are marked up and it's also in the
intake<00:02:20.630> set<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.900> holes<00:02:21.080> now<00:02:21.890> what<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.280> is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
intake set of holes now what it is is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.370 
intake set of holes now what it is is
you<00:02:22.700> actually<00:02:22.910> have<00:02:23.210> both<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.810> same<00:02:24.020> exact

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
you actually have both the same exact

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.200 
you actually have both the same exact
gears<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.250> an<00:02:25.340> in-tank<00:02:25.790> set<00:02:26.120> of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
gears so you have an in-tank set of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.000 
gears so you have an in-tank set of
holes<00:02:26.390> which<00:02:26.780> will<00:02:26.930> put<00:02:27.050> on<00:02:27.140> your<00:02:27.260> in<00:02:27.470> tank<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
holes which will put on your in tank and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.380 
holes which will put on your in tank and
then<00:02:28.490> they<00:02:28.580> have<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:28.850> set<00:02:29.000> up<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
then they have it set up with the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.870 
then they have it set up with the
exhaust<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:30.020> your<00:02:30.320> exhaust<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.610> what<00:02:31.790> it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
exhaust on your exhaust and so what it

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.230 
exhaust on your exhaust and so what it
is<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.270> can<00:02:32.390> actually<00:02:32.570> take<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.170> put<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:34.240> in

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
is you can actually take and put the in

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.690 
is you can actually take and put the in
tank<00:02:35.630> set<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.350> holes<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> exhaust<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.640> you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
tank set of holes on the exhaust and you

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.640 
tank set of holes on the exhaust and you
can<00:02:37.880> adjust<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.480> timing<00:02:38.810> by<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> half<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.440> tooth

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
can adjust the timing by a half a tooth

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.240 
can adjust the timing by a half a tooth
to<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> time<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:42.010> after<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.070> get<00:02:43.160> your

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
to the time and so after you get your

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.510 
to the time and so after you get your
bottom<00:02:43.490> bolt<00:02:43.670> out<00:02:43.850> there<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.830> go<00:02:46.010> ahead<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
bottom bolt out there and go ahead and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.260 
bottom bolt out there and go ahead and
mark<00:02:47.480> your<00:02:47.920> timing<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.040> your<00:02:49.160> cam<00:02:49.490> since<00:02:49.940> after

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
mark your timing on your cam since after

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.540 
mark your timing on your cam since after
you<00:02:50.360> put<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.750> other<00:02:50.870> sets<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.260> holes

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
you put it on the other sets of holes

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.280 
you put it on the other sets of holes
none<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.850> lines<00:02:53.390> on<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.870> cam<00:02:54.080> will

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
none of the lines on the cam will

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.880 
none of the lines on the cam will
actually<00:02:54.710> line<00:02:54.890> up<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.460> head<00:02:55.760> anymore<00:02:56.890> so

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
actually line up on the head anymore so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.300 
actually line up on the head anymore so
you<00:02:58.010> mark<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.310> timing<00:03:02.620> right<00:03:03.620> on<00:03:03.920> your<00:03:04.040> cam

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
you mark your timing right on your cam

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.870 
you mark your timing right on your cam
there

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.180 

you<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.209> here<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:15.410> lined<00:03:15.709> up<00:03:15.920> nice<00:03:16.160> and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
you can see here it lined up nice and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.059 
you can see here it lined up nice and
straight<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> head<00:03:17.000> there<00:03:17.239> now<00:03:20.860> after<00:03:21.860> you

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
straight on the head there now after you

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.740 
straight on the head there now after you
got<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.340> marked<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:23.390> go<00:03:23.540> ahead<00:03:23.630> and

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
got that marked and you can go ahead and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:37.690 
got that marked and you can go ahead and
pull<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.260> other<00:03:24.530> cam<00:03:24.950> bolt<00:03:25.250> off

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:48.170 

I'm<00:03:38.690> going<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.170> cutes<00:03:39.560> right<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:40.040> top

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:57.950 

right<00:03:49.180> there<00:03:50.730> go<00:03:51.730> ahead<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:51.940> pull<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.150> out

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.690 

I<00:03:58.050> usually<00:03:58.860> just<00:03:59.010> take<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.190> flat<00:03:59.370> screwdriver

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
I usually just take a flat screwdriver

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:12.830 
I usually just take a flat screwdriver
and<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.790> pop<00:04:03.060> this<00:04:03.300> out<00:04:09.350> just<00:04:10.350> like<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:11.840> I'm

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
and you pop this out just like that I'm

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.180 
and you pop this out just like that I'm
going<00:04:12.990> to<00:04:13.050> be<00:04:13.110> real<00:04:13.290> careful<00:04:13.500> not<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.010> drop

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
going to be real careful not to drop

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.560 
going to be real careful not to drop
anything<00:04:14.460> down<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.000> case

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
anything down on the case

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.590 
anything down on the case
and<00:04:16.190> then<00:04:17.190> keep<00:04:17.430> tension<00:04:17.700> on<00:04:17.910> your<00:04:17.970> chain<00:04:18.330> so

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
and then keep tension on your chain so

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.030 
and then keep tension on your chain so
you<00:04:18.660> don't<00:04:18.840> lose<00:04:18.989> timing<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> bottom<00:04:19.890> and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
you don't lose timing on the bottom and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.460 
you don't lose timing on the bottom and
on<00:04:20.130> your<00:04:20.310> crankshaft<00:04:20.640> to<00:04:20.910> either<00:04:24.140> go<00:04:25.140> ahead

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
on your crankshaft to either go ahead

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:35.170 
on your crankshaft to either go ahead
and<00:04:25.590> pop<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.770> back<00:04:26.070> up<00:04:26.220> there<00:04:26.430> real<00:04:26.610> quick

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.620 

all<00:04:36.180> right

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
all right

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.720 
all right
so<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.350> when<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.680> do<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.010> it's<00:04:38.310> easy<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.700> you

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
so and when you do that it's easy so you

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.040 
so and when you do that it's easy so you
can<00:04:38.880> go<00:04:38.970> ahead<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.120> just<00:04:39.210> count<00:04:39.540> two<00:04:39.810> teeth

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
can go ahead and just count two teeth

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.260 
can go ahead and just count two teeth
what<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.920> is<00:04:41.130> you'll<00:04:41.280> move<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:42.030> gear

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
what it is is you'll move the gear

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.770 
what it is is you'll move the gear
exactly<00:04:42.720> two<00:04:42.960> teeth<00:04:43.260> on<00:04:43.560> your<00:04:43.980> chain<00:04:44.540> I'm<00:04:45.540> go

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
exactly two teeth on your chain I'm go

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.530 
exactly two teeth on your chain I'm go
ahead<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:45.990> line<00:04:46.110> this<00:04:46.320> back<00:04:46.560> up<00:04:48.230> right<00:04:49.230> there

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
ahead and line this back up right there

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.200 
ahead and line this back up right there
now<00:04:51.540> if<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.780> notice<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.380> exhaust<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:54.090> can

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
now if you notice on the exhaust you can

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.930 
now if you notice on the exhaust you can
see<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:55.140> lines<00:04:55.380> are<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:55.710> slightly<00:04:56.520> retarded

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
see the lines are just slightly retarded

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.540 
see the lines are just slightly retarded
on<00:04:57.360> there<00:04:57.510> now<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:58.710> that's<00:04:58.890> what<00:04:59.160> you<00:04:59.280> wanted

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
on there now and that's what you wanted

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.740 
on there now and that's what you wanted
to<00:04:59.610> do<00:04:59.790> because<00:05:00.120> you're<00:05:00.270> retarding<00:05:00.660> it

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
to do because you're retarding it

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.790 
to do because you're retarding it
exactly<00:05:01.140> one-half<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.860> tooth<00:05:06.560> go<00:05:07.560> ahead<00:05:07.710> and

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
exactly one-half a tooth go ahead and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:55.809 
exactly one-half a tooth go ahead and
bolt<00:05:07.980> that<00:05:08.010> one<00:05:08.310> back<00:05:08.490> on

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:02.480 

all<00:05:56.819> right<00:05:58.759> so<00:05:59.759> that<00:06:00.060> is<00:06:00.360> how<00:06:00.569> you<00:06:00.599> do<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.530> half

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
all right so that is how you do the half

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.790 
all right so that is how you do the half
a<00:06:02.699> tooth<00:06:02.939> retard<00:06:03.509> on<00:06:03.810> your<00:06:03.990> exhaust<00:06:04.289> cam<00:06:04.560> to

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
a tooth retard on your exhaust cam to

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.469 
a tooth retard on your exhaust cam to
get<00:06:04.919> more<00:06:05.159> mid-range<00:06:05.400> and<00:06:05.849> top-end<00:06:06.029> out<00:06:06.389> of

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
get more mid-range and top-end out of

00:06:06.479 --> 00:07:00.620 
get more mid-range and top-end out of
your<00:06:06.569> bike

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.690 

you
