00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.649
 seven thousand years and they traveled from one country to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 another and from one planet to another the congress 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.790

 symposium on ancient sciences to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
 through Sanskrit based on the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.129

 flight in the old india said weddings there 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 a reference of the old aviation in

 country to another 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.280
 to another and from one planet to another mentioned 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 97 reference books for aviation 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 history is limited to pointing out that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.770
 rick brothers flew for the first time in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.850
 Various types of metal alloys 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 used to build a plane said 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.550
 weddings adding now we have to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 import aircraft alloys the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.660
 young generation must study the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 alloys mentioned in your book and 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.030
 make the stamps here I also talk about 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.060

 18 x 18 meters and in some cases more 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.930
 of 70 meters they were jumbo airplanes 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.080
 the old planes had 40 engines 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.470
 small the aviation of today does not know yet 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.750
 of flexible exhaust system said the 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.750
 radar system of the ancient india it 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 he called stealing canary in this system 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.770
 the shape of the plane was presented in 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.960
 observer 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.110
 of the mere flashing light that you see in 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.300
 modern radar systems said the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 Book of Bari Atwan mentions a diet 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.790

 published by a center scientist 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.560
 of NASA's research had 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.840
 demanded that the scheduled conference be 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.960
 will cancel since it mixes the mythology with

 science the petition said us 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.640
 as a scientific community we should 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.710
 be seriously concerned about the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.930
 infiltration of pseudoscience in the 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.960
 science curriculum with the backing of 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.180
 the influential political parties the 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.150
 Nasa will be concerned about what the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.800
 india can show the world maybe something 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.800
 that they did not want to show
