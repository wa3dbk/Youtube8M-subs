that's already connected on one side and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.350 
that's already connected on one side and
then<00:02:05.780> underneath<00:02:06.530> will<00:02:07.340> carabiner<00:02:07.820> clip<00:02:08.090> I

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360

then going from front those three in
place<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.960> case<00:03:04.110> having<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.620> short

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
place it's just a case having the short

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.400 
place it's just a case having the short
one<00:03:05.540> putting<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.140> that'll<00:03:07.380> just

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
one putting it on and that'll just

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.500 
one putting it on and that'll just
tension<00:03:07.920> tension<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.610> P<00:03:08.760> camp<00:03:10.670> again<00:03:11.670> just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
tension tension the P camp again just

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.100 
tension tension the P camp again just
tighten<00:03:12.810> out<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.200> do<00:03:13.560> up<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.709> screws<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.130> that

tighten out and do up the screws on that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.000 
tighten out and do up the screws on that
and<00:03:16.110> that's<00:03:16.230> pretty<00:03:16.380> much<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> shape<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010
