00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello to my followers again 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 channel 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.090
 My last review yesterday scored already 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.880
 more than 13 likes so i'm doing a new one 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.340
 review and now i decide what i will do 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 under the same system if you want 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 The following review on Friday should 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.300
 put 20 likes then did a review and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.019
 when I have any incentive 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.199
 so let's start today in our review will be 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 games like ant focuses now 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 smasher 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.630
 knock down elantra 02 this app 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.450
 maybe quite old is no longer 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.489
 I know many people in his time to the outside 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.250
 play in principle nothing complicated 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 there is no 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.600
 you need to crush insects and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.690
 insects every time become such 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.390
 here are such here are such big 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:04.010
 you can not kill everything as I understood oh oh oh 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:13.140
 oh once again let's take a new one 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:17.040
 so so so he decided to go well not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.479
 receive further such that it is not clear 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.479
 I don't know centipedes 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 so well, what is the principle of gameplay 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.780
 to catch all the insects 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.100
 understood and will be more and more and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.420
 quite difficult to be in time for everyone 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.330
 beat them so that's cool hail 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 to pass the time so you can 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.479
 look 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:59.039
 records for maximum and second game 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.670
 This is direct I do not know a copy of angry birds 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:08.570
 but it seemed to me has the rights to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:14.310
 life will be settled like this they are 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.989
 for example, let's take the first level even 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.209
 the instruction is almost the same as angry 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.330
 birds of course can say such here 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:33.920
 cubes 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:33.920
 physics murals embers have this so 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.120
 let's try again 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.780
 and me 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.640
 the trajectory here needs to be calculated 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.310
 trajectory and in principle in principle the game 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.630
 how difficult it is at the first levels 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.519
 but further it will be more difficult but so far 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:29.120
 bear and armor is very difficult not 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:33.349
 buy replied toy principle i 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.890
 understood the level of the young channel if he gives 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:42.079
 and engry birds principle a good replacement for 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.870
 him for a short time and the last igruha 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.519
 this is line runner 2 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.359
 Basically what was almost mine 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.930
 yesterday's review 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:56.590
 grand daddy asset wounds here a little bit 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.590
 differently 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:12.260
 oh well 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:22.130
 see in principle and the meaning is almost the same 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:25.910
 run as long as possible okay 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:37.970
 once again actually be able to such a player 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:42.520
 recently very very much here 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.520
 so here and understand their own than some play 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.630
 if you want video again 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.230
 5 esw appeared put under video 2 with 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.210
 likes and then there will be a video 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.310
 I know or will tanks or review, too 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.160
 will probably depend more on me 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.630
 subscribe to the channel group VKontakte 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.190

 Stream principle every day interesting 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.970
