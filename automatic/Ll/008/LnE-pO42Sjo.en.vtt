that you just said that and then on top

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.230 
that you just said that and then on top
of<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.830> think<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.190> music<00:02:45.580> in<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.820> pot<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.120> is

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
of it I think the music in the pot it is

of it I think the music in the pot it is
just<00:02:46.600> beautiful<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.380> beginning<00:02:47.709> of<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
just beautiful the beginning of the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.100

think is when you walk out and right

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.120 
think is when you walk out and right
before<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.450> first<00:02:52.630> promenade<00:02:53.140> mm-hmm<00:02:53.650> when
