00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 or the cracks as they are welcome to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.620
 almost last day of life already 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.430
 you are probably watching all 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.490
 the videos already followed because really 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.410
 today is the last day that is today is 31 is 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.860
 this video is supposed to have 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.590
 out yesterday but that will explain the 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.419
 tomorrow's day or in the next video 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.009
 today as you see in the title 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.809
 I bring as a new section that 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.250
 really is not new to many, that is 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:30.669
 Many already know her but in my channel she is 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.890
 new 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.350
 I had never done that before and 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.790
 The truth is that I do not know how I'm going to 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.649
 leave but likewise I'm going to 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.670
 come up you know now that I'm going to 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.170
 react to the Martian's trailer that 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.719
 Mexico apparently they are going to put the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.519
 'rescue operation' then for 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.929
 completely change the name but it's 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.789
 Well I'm not sure if I'm going to put 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.379
 the trailer here because I do not have the 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.940
 rights of that trailer and the truth is 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.699
 I feel it will take a lot longer 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.620
 when editing it, so I 'll see it in my 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.230
 cell that is this and they are going to see my 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.890
 reactions ok ok I get closer 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.720
 so that they see more of themselves so that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.460
 see more about my reactions and 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.050
 let's put it seems hard 4 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.050
 minutes with three seconds 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.180
 ok I do not need English with subtitles 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.180
 what is already 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.440
 the game 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.640
 It's unique 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.769
 and I want to see all of that 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.760
 like the deceased 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.140
 that is, they are going to die 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.400
 way 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.080
 I'm really excited about this 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.430
 movie the truth is that there was never 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.140
 made a reaction to the trailer and now 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.940
 what I do is pretty funny 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.650
 because I feel that my face does not say anything 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.630
 but really inside I'm very 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.400
 excited and probably expresses little 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.440
 that emotion had not seen the trailer of 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.840
 fact I was taking care of detail in detail 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.570
 because on Facebook they post it a lot and 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.430
 I was careful not to see for a second that 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.080
 trailer because I was saving it for 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.100
 make a video reaction because I tell them 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.990
 that is a book that I liked very much 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.060
 you have to read it I hope that in 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.740
 September and you have my review and 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.270
 if not, then send me a tweet 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.290
 telling me alexis you said that in 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.940
 September 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.710
 We were going to have your review of the Martian 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.960
 we are waiting if you have already read 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.090
 this book have already seen the trailer tell me 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.590
 how do you think I am the truth 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.660
 shocked when he is reading the book 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.270
 the characters in my head did not have 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.770
 as an exact figure use the 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.630
 features were not as accurate 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.000
 I really did not imagine all of the 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.980
 concept all the descriptions that 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.050
 the author is doing all that I 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.880
 I imagined and only imagined myself as 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.950
 an astronaut or his suit 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.160
 astronaut on Mars and now that I see it 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.900
 here is everything 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.850
 very much more bastard a lot more 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.170
 great if you want that when 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.880
 come out the movie make them a 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.560
 book comparison movie put on the 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.000
 comments and I will know what is it 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.770
 what do I have to do after seeing the 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.420
 movie excites me a lot I hope that 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.670
 leave soon and if I noticed the date 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.650
 I think it comes out in October like I do not know 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.170
 I'm very nervous about the interpretation 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.910
 of matt damon like this character because 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.630
 this character in the book is very 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.360
 funny and then the trailer seemed to be 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.400
 quite serious and pretty roll of 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.800
 science fiction and here also to science 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.420
 fiction is also things of the nasa and 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.430
 all these things but also the 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.530
 It is the protagonist makes history 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.390
 I caught you and I hooked you and then 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.460
 I hope matt damon will do that 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.720
 because if not, I'm really going to be very 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.490
 disappointed but already that later 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.860
 we'll be back and then I'll tell you my 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.200
 I'm leaving because I already have to 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.330
 go to continue editing and moving videos and 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.770
 recording videos and so many did 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.390
 thanks for watching this video remember that 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.210

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.210
