making your finished sides look a little
bit<00:00:27.800> nicer<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.179> they're<00:00:30.179> done<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> few

bit nicer and they're done in a few
different<00:00:31.230> ways<00:00:31.850> this<00:00:32.850> technique<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
different ways this technique here is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.430 
different ways this technique here is
called<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> Garter<00:00:35.660> selvage<00:00:36.660> edge<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
called the Garter selvage edge and it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.520 
called the Garter selvage edge and it
creates<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:38.100> small<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.329> stitch<00:00:39.690> border<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
creates a small one stitch border of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.920 
creates a small one stitch border of
garter<00:00:41.010> stitch<00:00:41.190> along<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> sides<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
garter stitch along the sides now this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.139 
garter stitch along the sides now this
works<00:00:43.230> particularly<00:00:43.710> nicely<00:00:44.489> with

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
works particularly nicely with

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
works particularly nicely with
stockinette<00:00:46.020> fabric<00:00:46.640> it<00:00:47.640> helps<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.620> keep<00:00:49.620> from

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
stockinette fabric it helps it keep from

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.939 
stockinette fabric it helps it keep from
curling<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:51.420> bit<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.680> gives<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
curling a little bit and also gives you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.600 
curling a little bit and also gives you
a<00:00:53.010> nice<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.340> finished<00:00:53.850> edge<00:00:54.530> along<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
a nice little finished edge along the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.099 
a nice little finished edge along the
side<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:57.899> bit

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
side now it's going to look a little bit

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.150 
side now it's going to look a little bit
different<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.879> your<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.270> side<00:01:01.160> beginning

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
different on your right side beginning

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.020 
different on your right side beginning
edge<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.049> end<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.369> that's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
edge then it will on the end and that's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.570 
edge then it will on the end and that's
okay<00:01:06.600> there's<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.799> any<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> get

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
okay there's not really any way to get

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640 
okay there's not really any way to get
around<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.530> pretty

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
around that for this but it's pretty

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.310 
around that for this but it's pretty
easy<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.869> we've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.140> our

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
easy to do we can see that we've got our

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.550 
easy to do we can see that we've got our
little<00:01:13.439> garter<00:01:13.890> stitch<00:01:14.130> nubs<00:01:15.140> right<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.380> now

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
little garter stitch nubs right here now

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
little garter stitch nubs right here now
you'll<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> times<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.909> garter

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you'll see a lot of times in garter

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
you'll see a lot of times in garter
stitch<00:01:18.710> or<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:20.070> stockinette<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.970> scarves

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
stitch or in stockinette like scarves

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620 
stitch or in stockinette like scarves
and<00:01:22.200> such<00:01:22.430> or<00:01:23.430> even<00:01:23.700> swatches<00:01:24.240> sometimes

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and such or even swatches sometimes

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.550 
and such or even swatches sometimes
they'll<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> garter<00:01:25.200> stitch<00:01:25.409> border

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
they'll have a garter stitch border

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
they'll have a garter stitch border
that's<00:01:26.009> about<00:01:26.189> three<00:01:26.520> stitches<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's about three stitches this is the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.270 
that's about three stitches this is the
same<00:01:27.960> principle<00:01:28.200> we're<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.710> doing<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.009> over

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
same principle we're just doing it over

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
same principle we're just doing it over
one<00:01:29.549> stitch<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.659> effect<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.409> bit

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
one stitch so the effect is a little bit

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.880 
one stitch so the effect is a little bit
more<00:01:31.770> subtle<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.590> simple

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
more subtle so to do this is very simple

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.160 
more subtle so to do this is very simple
we're<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> knit<00:01:36.060> into<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.930> first

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
we're just going to knit into the first

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.609 
we're just going to knit into the first
stitch<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.710> step<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.720> we'll<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.439> knit

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
stitch for step one and we'll just knit

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:50.359 
stitch for step one and we'll just knit
across<00:01:42.170> all<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> end<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> for

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
across all the way to the end and for

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
across all the way to the end and for
step<00:01:50.579> two<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.049> knit<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.740> last

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
step two we are going to knit the last

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.630 
step two we are going to knit the last
stitch<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.390> row<00:01:54.860> now<00:01:55.860> when<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.189> turn<00:01:56.399> our

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
stitch in the row now when we turn our

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.020 
stitch in the row now when we turn our
work<00:01:56.850> around<00:01:57.740> normally<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.159> would<00:01:59.369> purl<00:01:59.729> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
work around normally you would purl this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.200 
work around normally you would purl this
first<00:02:00.360> stitch<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.890> wrong<00:02:02.729> side<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.419 
fabric in stockinette before step three
we're<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.640> knit<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:07.259> stitch<00:02:07.590> instead

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
we're going to knit the stitch instead

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.449 
we're going to knit the stitch instead
and<00:02:08.849> then<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.720> continue<00:02:10.500> working<00:02:11.129> our

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and then we will continue working our

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.309 
and then we will continue working our
purl<00:02:11.730> stitch<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.150> we'll<00:02:12.270> bring<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.599> yarn

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
purl stitch so we'll bring the yarn

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.440 
purl stitch so we'll bring the yarn
and<00:02:13.620> purl<00:02:14.489> all<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.090> way<00:02:15.650> across<00:02:17.269> okay<00:02:18.269> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and purl all the way across okay and
