00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.830 
wasn't the the best guy to put in that
slot<00:05:29.430> but<00:05:29.700> he<00:05:29.820> was<00:05:29.940> at<00:05:30.060> first<00:05:30.210> too<00:05:30.480> you<00:05:30.690> know<00:05:30.810> I

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
slot but he was at first too you know I

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.290 
slot but he was at first too you know I
guess<00:05:31.140> he'd<00:05:31.320> say<00:05:31.500> star<00:05:31.920> that<00:05:32.820> they<00:05:32.940> put<00:05:33.150> over

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
guess he'd say star that they put over

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.770 
guess he'd say star that they put over
there<00:05:33.540> um<00:05:34.100> but<00:05:35.100> you<00:05:35.280> can<00:05:35.430> think<00:05:35.640> of<00:05:35.880> what<00:05:36.750> else

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
there um but you can think of what else

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.130 
there um but you can think of what else
is<00:05:37.200> on<00:05:37.320> spike<00:05:37.650> TV<00:05:37.940> could<00:05:38.940> Vince<00:05:39.330> McMahon<00:05:39.690> once

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
is on spike TV could Vince McMahon once

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.740 
is on spike TV could Vince McMahon once
again<00:05:40.470> kill<00:05:40.980> kill<00:05:41.430> off<00:05:41.640> his<00:05:41.880> competition<00:05:42.390> by

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
again kill kill off his competition by

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.080 
again kill kill off his competition by
moving<00:05:43.140> smackdown<00:05:43.740> once<00:05:44.490> again<00:05:44.640> I<00:05:44.790> think<00:05:44.910> this

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
moving smackdown once again I think this

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.520 
moving smackdown once again I think this
would<00:05:45.210> be<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.390> fourth<00:05:45.690> network<00:05:46.140> that's<00:05:46.320> been

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
would be the fourth network that's been

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.460 
would be the fourth network that's been
on<00:05:46.710> with<00:05:46.920> them<00:05:47.070> being<00:05:47.250> on<00:05:47.430> the<00:05:47.550> UPN<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.780> CW<00:05:49.350> the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
on with them being on the UPN the CW the

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.830 
on with them being on the UPN the CW the
sci-fi<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.220> then<00:05:50.340> on<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.580> spike<00:05:50.880> spiketv

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
sci-fi and then on to spike spiketv

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.570 
sci-fi and then on to spike spiketv
would<00:05:52.320> be<00:05:52.440> putting<00:05:52.620> a<00:05:52.770> lot<00:05:52.950> of<00:05:52.980> money<00:05:53.100> into<00:05:53.400> it

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
would be putting a lot of money into it

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.920 
would be putting a lot of money into it
it<00:05:53.670> would<00:05:53.760> be<00:05:53.880> contracting<00:05:54.510> you<00:05:54.570> got<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.840> think
