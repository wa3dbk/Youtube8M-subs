00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 have been playing for nine games 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.390
 hansa without winning the new one too 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.369
 charme offensive to the fans do not stop 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 brought so much 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.119
 the youth it is directed at had 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.810

 it's about what either or 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.700
 Today you can see today is really a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.680
 The decisive game today will be one 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000
 decisive game is enough 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:52.739
 how will it be, what do you think? 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 difficult why eight times in a row 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.789
 has won and does not act and so 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.469
 Laying the like are called again and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.210
 still the surprisingly offered 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.040
 Brinkies in the hansa box in the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.049
 Gloves looking for the ball of bullet 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.900
 you still get lucky in the baltic sea 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.090
 hansa and heidenheim fueled each other five times 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.890
 in the first half skillfully until the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.840
 penalty area by banner year-round nonetheless 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 unfortunately not much longer 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.369
 42 minute corner for Heidenheim and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.100
 Leonard Haas sinks the ball in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.439
 own network has so incredibly beautiful 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.880
 the new purchase from ingolstadt never 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.030
 for looked I met was in the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.500
 first half good game of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
 i have only seen open play from 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.810
 both teams with chances 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.060
 like over there 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.409
 Of course it fits with us 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.940
 in the picture that we just by a 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.100
 owner is in arrears that is 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.690
 almost the icing on the cake with us 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.850
 an anti run we currently have 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.149
 hansa agrees in the first half 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.050
 with chances but flat and carpenter 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.020
 just have no shower today 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.399
 second half would have opa hans werner then 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.890
 prefer to home spent a 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.440
 crunchy game without scoring chances up to 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.679
 80 minute michael thurk does that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.149
 heidenheimer says to 220 hansa since four 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.130
 months without victory and already on wednesday 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.789
 comes the table eighth from burghausen 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.789
 we look at that
