00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:13.950
 That's how I talk about it, I'm a rodrigo and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.220
 today I will give my impressions on the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.800
 gol simulator beach the android that is 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.490
 an adaptation of this crazy game that made 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.310
 relative success in pcs good and how it is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.699
 you can write it here you could say 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.740
 which is a blood box or a game of 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.559
 open world in which you control a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 goat and there really is not much that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.399
 do in terms of emissions 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 If you have it, it's what you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.750
 approximation of emissions can be said that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.329
 you can collect the items you release 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.910
 new clothes for your goat and also gives 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 to get active mix and points to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 from crazy things that you 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 It does like jumping off the top of a tower and I 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 I blew up a gas station. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 seriously no more is not objective 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.570
 that you have to comply with the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 have been adapted quite bad and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.490
 options include 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 also to let go of her tongue in some 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.159
 thing to catch and then you can 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 change clothes for example picking up a 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.560
 jetpack that will release new 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.890
 moving like leaves and things 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.890
 of this type 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.340
 so most of the time you go 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.170
 spend doing nonsense things more 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.960
 fun ways to sculpt parties 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.380
 human beings who are moving forward in a 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 jump or slide toboggan leaves 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.060
 pulling a car to destroy things 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.920
 actions that usually come to mind 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.310
 when we get a world game 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.430
 that has no clear goals 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.259
 I have to say that the movement 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.610
 this version for ios and android do not 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.009
 pleased so much 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.740
 it works with a virtual analog in the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.600
 left and the related camera with the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.229
 right as with any other 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.149
 other fps the title of the genre but not without 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.489
 The rare times you'll find yourself 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.500
 fights with the camera or even with the 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.810
 own goat to try to position in the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.890
 front of a ladder to climb to the 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.530
 like 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.019
 this is a failure or at least one 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.790
 lack of polish in gameplay that 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.650
 should be made clear to most 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.840
 people 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 in addition on the ipod have five that was the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.120
 device that I used to do these 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.130
 images 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.320
 I do not know that many times the scene and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.299
 building myself in front of the measure 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.700
 that I was giving as well as 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.400
 I noticed some rapids I'll give them when 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.100
 I destroy some things some of these 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.930
 aspects are those technicians can even 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.420
 be ignored when you are in the zone 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.799
 game and that's what simulator is like 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.380
 a nuisance 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.780
 he does not even have a very 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.100
 great and as I have already made it very clear 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.620
 they do not have missions 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.900
 so if you want to pay $ 5 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.250
 which is the present value and aware that 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.290
 It's a business to have fun. 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.900
 totally uncompromised 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.720
 in the end say that it is good or 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.180
 bad and is recommended or not being tava 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.060
 little complicated because it does not perform well 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.130
 niche for those interested in a blue 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.650
 and it 's worth it 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.170
 but I do not doubt that soon I 'll roll 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.170
 the liquefaction promotions will cost 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.090
 there one or two dollars 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.310

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.049

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.209
 click write because so you 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.019
 accompanies my next publications in the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.400
 youtube 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.019
