00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to all I propose to you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.700
 today to discover the tutorial 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 in the serrated art that I realized on 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.940
 a pastel polish from the collection 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.420
 pastor life of the mark at the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.420
 cosmetic 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 we sound to art I used varnish 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.060
 lavender I applied on the left 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.529
 I then take paint 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.750
 acrylic white opio using a 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.059
 fine brush here I drew a brush from 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.589
 size 1 I will take my painting 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.210
 is well going to work to remobilize 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.190
 the material on my brush 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.649
 I will then come to realize a 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.559
 kind of wave a line of a line 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.790
 fine to realize my lies so there is 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.320
 you can place it where you want 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.239
 I made a shape a little bit of 2000 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 August and then I'll start realizing 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.409
 parallel lines 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.850
 so if you have good load your 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.739
 brush normally you will be able 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.059
 draw lines very long so 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.879
 it's very important to load 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.259
 brush two-thirds of the brush and no 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.360
 not just on the tip like this your 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.210
 brush is going to be enduring I'm going next 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:16.540
 draw lines upside down this for 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:18.820
 realize my residence i'm going now 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.770
 to make a tiny bridge over 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.049
 the boundary line of the resin 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.490
 so really I'm going to work with the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.439
 tip of my brush so I hold the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.850
 brush well vertically on a 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.200
 fine brush like that it can happen 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.180
 that there is a small drop of 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.680
 dry paint that forms in these cases 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.330
 there you have to clean your brush and then 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.040
 scratching the tip is very important 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.620
 otherwise it will be too dry and you are not going 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 not be able to draw a line 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.340
 I then added a second line of 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.890
 lead over the first in 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.210
 staggered so I did that here on 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.400
 the whole length on some of 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.350
 frozen troubles especially do on the hollow 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.700
 or on the beginning you are you are 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.049
 not obliged to follow this model you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.049
 can really listen to your desires 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.730
 to accentuate this serrated side I 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.440
 realized two tiny peas using 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.060
 of a crowd coaching needles so I 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.920
 going to perform at the intersection of 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 some of some crossings of my 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.480
 praises of barsi and i'm also going 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.020
 add the duet with lace 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.020
 Semi circle 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.799
 to finish I realized drops so 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.170
 for that I'm well soaked my brush 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.420
 of painting I will lay the tip of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.010
 my brush and crushed it on the body of the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.010
 brush to get a little drop 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.370
 under 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.490
 as always I finish my mail art in 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.960
 applying a good coat of top coat 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.400
 this tutorial is now over you 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.780
 can find all the material that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.570
 I used on the site kaleme 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.860
 cosmetics point fr I hope that this 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.560
 tutorial will have made you want to do 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.090
 in your turn some laces I tell you to
