 Sergey money to shoot 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.500

 they told me the amount and now I mean 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 I was very surprised how poor they were 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.680
 walk means the city stick to people 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.289

 so I was caught we are in the park 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.299
 703 Cherepovets before I charge decided 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.450
 come to this park I very rarely go to 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 go by accident and here it means 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.280

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.060
 growth was a gun when I guess of course 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.590
 all the same, it scared me not that they 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.810
 there was a microphone that they had a gun on 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.600
 it's more influenced to listen style went 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 otherwise I would never have agreed 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.399

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.600
