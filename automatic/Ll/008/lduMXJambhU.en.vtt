00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
well as crash site which makes a

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.870 
well as crash site which makes a
reappearance<00:00:17.750> from<00:00:18.440> voices<00:00:19.100> too<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:19.609> the

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880

hunter mode is a brand new mode that we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.220 
hunter mode is a brand new mode that we
have<00:00:21.980> proceeded<00:00:22.340> three<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:22.880> basically<00:00:23.630> hits

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
have proceeded three it basically hits

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.200 
have proceeded three it basically hits
two<00:00:24.680> hunters<00:00:25.070> against<00:00:25.700> the<00:00:25.760> team<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:25.940> cell

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
two hunters against the team of cell

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.300 
two hunters against the team of cell
operatives<00:00:26.690> two<00:00:26.930> hunters<00:00:27.320> are<00:00:27.740> basically

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
operatives two hunters are basically

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:39.450 
operatives two hunters are basically
guys<00:00:28.490> with<00:00:28.700> nano<00:00:28.850> suits<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:29.570> they<00:00:30.080> have<00:00:30.289> bows

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.069 

they're<00:00:40.460> invisible<00:00:40.700> throughout<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.570> their

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
they're invisible throughout and their

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.840 
they're invisible throughout and their
aim<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.649> go<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:42.950> kill<00:00:43.190> all<00:00:43.399> of<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.670> cell

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
aim is to go and kill all of the cell

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.600 
aim is to go and kill all of the cell
operatives<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:45.230> idea<00:00:45.560> is<00:00:45.620> as<00:00:46.100> each<00:00:46.399> cell

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
operatives the idea is as each cell

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.760 
operatives the idea is as each cell
operative<00:00:47.060> is<00:00:47.420> killed<00:00:47.870> they're<00:00:48.290> turned<00:00:48.560> into

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
operative is killed they're turned into

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.979 
operative is killed they're turned into
a<00:00:48.829> hunter<00:00:49.130> as<00:00:49.280> well<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.270> dynamics<00:00:50.780> slowly

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
a hunter as well so the dynamics slowly

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.229 
a hunter as well so the dynamics slowly
but<00:00:51.260> surely<00:00:51.620> changes<00:00:52.130> as<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.700> game<00:00:52.850> goes<00:00:53.030> on

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
but surely changes as the game goes on

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.540 
but surely changes as the game goes on
it's<00:00:53.750> interesting<00:00:53.930> because<00:00:54.380> each<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
it's interesting because each of the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.959 
it's interesting because each of the
cell<00:00:55.910> operatives<00:00:56.360> have<00:00:57.460> just<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.550> gun<00:00:58.700> as<00:00:58.910> well

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
cell operatives have just a gun as well

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.209 
cell operatives have just a gun as well
as<00:00:59.210> EMP<00:00:59.600> grenades<00:00:59.930> which<00:01:00.559> they<00:01:00.860> have<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.010> use

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
as EMP grenades which they have to use

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.889 
as EMP grenades which they have to use
wisely<00:01:01.489> because<00:01:01.820> they<00:01:02.180> only<00:01:02.300> get<00:01:02.480> one<00:01:02.690> and

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
wisely because they only get one and

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.899 
wisely because they only get one and
it's<00:01:03.050> what<00:01:03.290> lets<00:01:03.710> them<00:01:03.890> see<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.280> hunter<00:01:04.579> just

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
it's what lets them see the hunter just

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:15.370 
it's what lets them see the hunter just
before<00:01:05.180> they<00:01:06.049> die<00:01:06.340> possibly

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.530 

today<00:01:16.380> we're<00:01:16.560> showing<00:01:16.710> museum<00:01:17.540> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
today we're showing museum it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.200 
today we're showing museum it's
basically<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.050> museum<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:20.150> rotted<00:01:21.150> away

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
basically a museum that is rotted away

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
basically a museum that is rotted away
and<00:01:21.630> has<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> swamp<00:01:22.320> growing<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> middle<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and has a swamp growing in the middle of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
and has a swamp growing in the middle of
it<00:01:23.300> it's<00:01:24.300> an<00:01:24.420> interesting<00:01:24.630> map<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.380> various

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it it's an interesting map with various

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.360 
it it's an interesting map with various
levels<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.340> verticality<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:28.160> it's<00:01:29.160> an

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
levels of verticality and it's an

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.090 
levels of verticality and it's an
interesting<00:01:29.640> very<00:01:30.120> eerie<00:01:30.710> place<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.950> play

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
interesting very eerie place to play

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
interesting very eerie place to play
hunter<00:01:32.580> especially<00:01:44.480> so<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:46.170> hunters<00:01:46.530> have

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
hunter especially so the hunters have

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.430 
hunter especially so the hunters have
bows<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.750> explosive<00:01:49.110> arrow

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
bows and they get one explosive arrow

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.860 
bows and they get one explosive arrow
which<00:01:50.400> they<00:01:50.550> can<00:01:50.700> use<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.150> try<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
which they can use to really try and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.560 
which they can use to really try and
take<00:01:52.050> out<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> group<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> cell<00:01:52.710> operatives

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
take out a group of cell operatives

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
take out a group of cell operatives
whereas<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:55.020> cell<00:01:55.229> operatives<00:01:55.800> themselves

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
whereas the cell operatives themselves

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
whereas the cell operatives themselves
have<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.820> selection<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.390> load<00:01:57.540> out<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:57.870> they<00:01:57.960> can

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
have a selection of load out so they can

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.320 
have a selection of load out so they can
choose<00:01:58.320> before<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> round<00:01:58.890> begins<00:01:59.280> those<00:02:00.210> are

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
choose before the round begins those are

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.620 
choose before the round begins those are
obviously<00:02:00.420> preset<00:02:01.160> and<00:02:02.180> they<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.390> no

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
obviously preset and they have no

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.570 
obviously preset and they have no
modules<00:02:04.110> no<00:02:04.350> Nanosuit<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.220> literally

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
modules no Nanosuit so it's literally

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.250 
modules no Nanosuit so it's literally
just<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> weapons<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.210> they<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.570> as<00:02:06.810> well

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
just the weapons that they have as well

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.350 
just the weapons that they have as well
as<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.710> EMP<00:02:08.070> grenade<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.610> proximity<00:02:08.910> alone

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
that kind of beeps and tells them when

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.850 
that kind of beeps and tells them when
the<00:02:12.060> hunter<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.420> nearby<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.500> other<00:02:13.650> mode

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the hunter is nearby the other mode

customize<00:04:30.990> their<00:04:31.440> Nanosuit<00:04:31.919> with<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.510> make

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
customize their Nanosuit with and make

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.570 
customize their Nanosuit with and make
it<00:04:33.630> individual<00:04:34.169> and<00:04:34.350> unique<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.710> them<00:04:34.860> well

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
it individual and unique to them well

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.700 
it individual and unique to them well
we've<00:04:35.790> gone<00:04:35.970> in<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.300> changed<00:04:36.660> some<00:04:37.590> stuff

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
we've gone in and changed some stuff

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.740 
we've gone in and changed some stuff
with<00:04:37.919> it<00:04:38.070> with<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.520> nanosuit<00:04:39.030> we<00:04:39.240> repurchased

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
with it with the nanosuit we repurchased

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.909 
with it with the nanosuit we repurchased
you<00:04:40.020> obviously<00:04:40.320> we<00:04:40.410> go<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.530> lot<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.800> feedback

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
you obviously we go a lot of feedback

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.100 
you obviously we go a lot of feedback
from<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.310> community<00:04:41.539> we<00:04:42.539> did<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> lot<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:42.930> play

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
from the community we did a lot of play

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.590 
from the community we did a lot of play
testing<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.710> our<00:04:43.950> own<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.370> we<00:04:44.479> decided<00:04:45.479> to

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
testing of our own and we decided to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.480 
testing of our own and we decided to
streamline<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.260> bit<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:47.010> now<00:04:47.160> with<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
streamline it a bit so now with the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.210 
streamline it a bit so now with the
couple<00:04:48.080> suit<00:04:49.080> energy<00:04:49.410> itself<00:04:49.770> now<00:04:49.950> we've<00:04:50.100> got

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
couple suit energy itself now we've got

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.279 
couple suit energy itself now we've got
a<00:04:50.250> separate<00:04:50.700> energy<00:04:51.060> bar<00:04:51.240> for<00:04:51.479> armor<00:04:51.810> we've

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
a separate energy bar for armor we've

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.810 
a separate energy bar for armor we've
got<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.410> separate<00:04:52.680> energy<00:04:53.010> bar<00:04:53.190> for<00:04:53.490> stealth

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
got a separate energy bar for stealth

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.409 
got a separate energy bar for stealth
for<00:04:54.630> cloaking<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.850> obviously<00:04:56.850> each<00:04:57.060> of<00:04:57.240> those

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
for cloaking and obviously each of those

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.040 
for cloaking and obviously each of those
is<00:04:58.430> individual<00:04:59.430> so<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.970> never<00:05:00.210> really<00:05:00.539> affects

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
is individual so it never really affects

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.350 
is individual so it never really affects
you<00:05:01.740> when<00:05:01.979> you're<00:05:02.220> running<00:05:02.460> which<00:05:03.210> was<00:05:03.330> a

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
you when you're running which was a

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.850 
you when you're running which was a
massive<00:05:03.720> problem<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:04.080> we<00:05:04.169> had<00:05:04.289> with<00:05:04.500> C<00:05:04.650> to

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
massive problem that we had with C to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.980 
massive problem that we had with C to
wear<00:05:05.130> when<00:05:05.280> players<00:05:05.550> would<00:05:05.820> run<00:05:06.030> they<00:05:06.840> would

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
wear when players would run they would

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.360 
wear when players would run they would
lose<00:05:07.139> energy<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.800> by<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.919> time<00:05:08.010> they<00:05:08.250> got

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
lose energy and by the time they got

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.100 
lose energy and by the time they got
into<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.639> battle<00:05:09.030> they<00:05:09.450> would<00:05:09.600> basically<00:05:09.810> be

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
into a battle they would basically be

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.420 
into a battle they would basically be
