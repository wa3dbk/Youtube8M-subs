okay<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.539> I'm<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.810> PhD<00:00:01.589> student<00:00:01.650> at<00:00:02.040> the

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
okay so I'm a PhD student at the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay so I'm a PhD student at the
University<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.090> Manitoba<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.810> I'm<00:00:04.650> studying

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
University of Manitoba and I'm studying

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.470 
University of Manitoba and I'm studying
thick-billed<00:00:05.430> murres<00:00:05.609> which<00:00:05.879> are<00:00:06.029> Siebert

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
thick-billed murres which are Siebert

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.209 
thick-billed murres which are Siebert
that<00:00:07.350> lives<00:00:07.560> in<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.770> Canadian<00:00:08.160> Arctic<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:10.219> so

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
that lives in the Canadian Arctic and so

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.480 
that lives in the Canadian Arctic and so
I<00:00:11.389> went<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.630> north<00:00:13.170> every<00:00:13.679> summer<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.160> several

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
I went up north every summer for several

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
I went up north every summer for several
years<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.690> would<00:00:15.839> work<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> cliffs

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
years and we would work on the cliffs

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.620 
years and we would work on the cliffs
every<00:00:17.100> year<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.490> study<00:00:17.850> these<00:00:18.210> are<00:00:18.390> cliff

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
every year to study these are cliff

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.679 
every year to study these are cliff
nesting<00:00:19.050> birds<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.760> we<00:00:20.760> would<00:00:20.910> go<00:00:21.150> descend

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
nesting birds and we would go descend

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
nesting birds and we would go descend
down<00:00:22.140> onto<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> cliffs<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.310> work<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
down onto the cliffs and work with the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.660 
down onto the cliffs and work with the
birds<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> thought<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.830> were<00:00:25.890> safe<00:00:26.130> but

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
birds and so we thought we were safe but

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.230 
birds and so we thought we were safe but
then<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.539> year<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.960> discovered<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.640> polar

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
then one year we discovered that a polar

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.450 
then one year we discovered that a polar
bear<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.750> cliffs<00:00:30.990> already<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.980> eating

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
bear on the cliffs already there eating

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.840 
bear on the cliffs already there eating
the<00:00:32.489> birds<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> feeding<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> adults<00:00:35.700> but

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the birds and feeding on the adults but

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.750 
the birds and feeding on the adults but
on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> chicks<00:00:36.680> we<00:00:37.680> were<00:00:37.800> amazed<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.610> such

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
on the chicks we were amazed it was such

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.990 
on the chicks we were amazed it was such
a<00:00:38.790> good<00:00:39.239> climber<00:00:40.010> we've<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.430> places<00:00:41.700> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
a good climber we've got two places on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.950 
a good climber we've got two places on
the<00:00:42.059> cliffs<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:42.570> never<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the cliffs that we would never go to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.010 
the cliffs that we would never go to
with<00:00:43.290> ropes<00:00:43.710> ourselves<00:00:44.719> we<00:00:45.719> don't<00:00:45.840> usually

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
with ropes ourselves we don't usually

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.160 
with ropes ourselves we don't usually
think<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> polar<00:00:46.620> bears<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.039> cliff<00:00:48.170> animals

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
think of polar bears as cliff animals

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
think of polar bears as cliff animals
but<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.860> guess<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> move<00:00:50.670> around<00:00:50.820> on

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
but I guess they have to move around on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
but I guess they have to move around on
the<00:00:51.090> ice<00:00:51.590> and<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:53.309> seemed<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.670> associated

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the ice and this seemed to be associated

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
the ice and this seemed to be associated
so<00:00:54.360> has<00:00:54.480> happened<00:00:54.840> twice<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.590> was

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
so has happened twice and it was

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220 
so has happened twice and it was
associated<00:00:56.280> each<00:00:56.489> time<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.030> years<00:00:57.930> when

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
associated each time with years when

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.889 
associated each time with years when
there's<00:00:58.440> not<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.620> much<00:00:58.890> ice<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.719> think

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
there's not very much ice so we think

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
there's not very much ice so we think
that<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.289> wasn't<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.859> ice<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.370> birth

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that there wasn't much ice of the birth

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.969 
that there wasn't much ice of the birth
of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> American<00:01:03.270> feed<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.930> seals<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.619> so

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
of the American feed on seals and so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.660 
of the American feed on seals and so
they<00:01:05.129> came<00:01:05.280> into<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:07.189> onto<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> cliffs<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
they came into the onto the cliffs to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.190 
they came into the onto the cliffs to
feed<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.970> birds<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.810> there<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.049> nothing

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
feed on birds because there was nothing

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
feed on birds because there was nothing
else<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.530> them<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.890> feed<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.880> seem

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
else for them to feed on and they seem

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.789 
else for them to feed on and they seem
to<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.240> quite<00:01:12.450> skinny<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.439> seem<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> be

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to be quite skinny they seem to be

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.760 
to be quite skinny they seem to be
smaller<00:01:14.130> possibly<00:01:14.790> young<00:01:15.000> Bears<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.110> were

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
smaller possibly young Bears that were

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.969 
smaller possibly young Bears that were
not<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.400> good<00:01:17.520> foragers<00:01:18.030> anyways<00:01:18.979> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
not very good foragers anyways the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.420 
not very good foragers anyways the
cliffs<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.430> virtually<00:01:21.619> vertical<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.890> there

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
cliffs are virtually vertical but there

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.429 
cliffs are virtually vertical but there
are<00:01:23.580> places<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.119> there's<00:01:24.900> crevasses<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
are places where there's crevasses and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.609 
are places where there's crevasses and
rocks<00:01:25.939> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> where<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.930> start<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> get

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
rocks kind of where you can start to get

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
rocks kind of where you can start to get
down<00:01:28.799> where<00:01:29.100> they've<00:01:29.280> been<00:01:29.310> rock<00:01:30.060> slides<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
down where they've been rock slides and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
down where they've been rock slides and
that's<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> bear<00:01:31.710> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> accessed<00:01:32.460> was

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that's how the bear kind of accessed was

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.899 
that's how the bear kind of accessed was
through<00:01:33.479> these<00:01:34.220> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> gullies<00:01:35.549> which

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
through these kind of gullies which

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
through these kind of gullies which
which<00:01:36.299> form<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.020> still<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.320> mean<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.590> wouldn't

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
which form but still I mean I wouldn't

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.240 
which form but still I mean I wouldn't
be<00:01:38.880> able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> access<00:01:39.240> these<00:01:39.570> places<00:01:39.860> without<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
be able to access these places without a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
be able to access these places without a
rope<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.180> I'd<00:01:42.479> also<00:01:42.720> emphasize<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> they're

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
rope and I'd also emphasize that they're

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.050 
rope and I'd also emphasize that they're
very<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.530> slick<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.909> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
very very slick because these are just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.139 
very very slick because these are just
covering<00:01:45.329> guano<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.960> bird<00:01:46.439> poop<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.460> um<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
covering guano in bird poop so um the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.240 
covering guano in bird poop so um the
cliffs<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.869> very<00:01:49.020> very<00:01:49.079> slipping<00:01:50.040> hard

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
cliffs are just very very slipping hard

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
cliffs are just very very slipping hard
it's<00:01:50.610> very<00:01:50.790> easy<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> slip<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> fall

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
it's very easy to slip and fall

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's very easy to slip and fall
so<00:01:52.890> there's<00:01:53.070> must<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.369> been<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.640> hungry

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
so there's must have been very hungry

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
so there's must have been very hungry
polar<00:01:54.509> bears<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> try<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.200> go<00:01:55.290> after<00:01:55.560> these

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
polar bears to try and go after these

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.789 
polar bears to try and go after these
birds<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.750> birds<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.530> parents

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
birds so the the birds the the parents

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
birds so the the birds the the parents
would<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:58.950> leave<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.520> mean<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.850> would<00:02:00.060> as

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
would just leave I mean they would as

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.639 
would just leave I mean they would as
soon<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.659> saw<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> bear<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.409> fly

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
soon as they saw the bear they would fly

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.530 
soon as they saw the bear they would fly
off<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.189> they're<00:02:02.820> they're<00:02:03.030> really<00:02:03.329> quite

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
off and they're they're really quite

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.539 
off and they're they're really quite
tame<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.990> us<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:05.070> deal<00:02:05.280> with<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
tame to us but they can deal with the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
tame to us but they can deal with the
polar<00:02:05.729> bear<00:02:06.000> they'll<00:02:06.329> they'll<00:02:06.659> try<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.990> fight

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
polar bear they'll they'll try and fight

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
polar bear they'll they'll try and fight
off<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.560> arctic<00:02:08.129> fox<00:02:08.340> sometimes<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.209> they

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
off of arctic fox sometimes but they

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.219 
off of arctic fox sometimes but they
knew<00:02:09.539> there<00:02:09.720> are<00:02:09.840> there

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
knew there are there

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.699 
knew there are there
you<00:02:10.319> know<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.619> polar<00:02:10.890> bear<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> polar<00:02:12.269> bear

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
you know a polar bear with a polar bear

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.770 
you know a polar bear with a polar bear
you<00:02:13.709> know<00:02:13.800> what<00:02:14.269> these<00:02:15.269> furs<00:02:15.540> are<00:02:15.659> quite

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you know what these furs are quite

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.059 
you know what these furs are quite
interesting<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:16.319> they're<00:02:16.620> called<00:02:16.860> you

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
interesting because they're called you

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.170 
interesting because they're called you
know<00:02:17.159> penguins<00:02:17.519> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> north<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> they

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
know penguins of the north and they

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.399 
know penguins of the north and they
basically<00:02:18.390> look<00:02:18.629> like<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> penguin

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
basically look like a penguin

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.559 
basically look like a penguin
I<00:02:19.440> suppose<00:02:20.310> one<00:02:20.519> reason<00:02:20.879> why<00:02:21.060> there's<00:02:21.330> no

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
I suppose one reason why there's no

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.080 
I suppose one reason why there's no
white<00:02:22.409> white<00:02:22.620> there's<00:02:23.340> no<00:02:23.489> flight<00:02:23.790> lists

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
white white there's no flight lists

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.089 
white white there's no flight lists
penguins<00:02:24.629> in<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.230> northern<00:02:25.500> hemisphere<00:02:25.650> is

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
penguins in the northern hemisphere is

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.490 
penguins in the northern hemisphere is
possibly<00:02:26.519> because<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.790> polar<00:02:27.060> bears<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.629> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
possibly because of polar bears in that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.289 
possibly because of polar bears in that
in<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.519> southern<00:02:29.670> hemisphere<00:02:29.879> there's

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
in the southern hemisphere there's

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.610 
in the southern hemisphere there's
nothing<00:02:30.510> like<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.690> polar<00:02:30.959> bear<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:31.379> they<00:02:31.470> don't

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
nothing like a polar bear so they don't

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.289 
nothing like a polar bear so they don't
need<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.860> fly<00:02:31.980> but<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.060> northern

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
need to fly but in the northern

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.240 
need to fly but in the northern
hemisphere<00:02:33.379> these<00:02:34.379> bears<00:02:34.739> would<00:02:34.920> wipe<00:02:35.069> them

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
hemisphere these bears would wipe them

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.610 
hemisphere these bears would wipe them
out<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.489> they<00:02:35.580> weren't<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.940> cliffs<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.620> so

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
out if they weren't on cliffs and so

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.259 
out if they weren't on cliffs and so
they<00:02:37.739> need<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.099> able<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.250> fly<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.489> nest<00:02:39.150> in

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
they need to be able to fly to nest in

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.289 
they need to be able to fly to nest in
inaccessible<00:02:39.690> places<00:02:40.280> but<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.519> course<00:02:41.760> some

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
inaccessible places but of course some

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.059 
inaccessible places but of course some
of<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.480> parts<00:02:42.780> were<00:02:42.930> accessible<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.769> turns

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
of the parts were accessible it turns

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.729 
of the parts were accessible it turns
out<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.019> shocked<00:02:46.290> because<00:02:46.530> I

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
out I was really shocked because I

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.470 
out I was really shocked because I
thought<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.160> safe<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.700> these<00:02:47.849> cliffs<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
thought I was safe on these cliffs and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.300 
thought I was safe on these cliffs and
you<00:02:48.989> know<00:02:49.079> we<00:02:49.230> never<00:02:49.410> take<00:02:49.620> any<00:02:49.829> protection

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
you know we never take any protection

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.520 
you know we never take any protection
under<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.549> cliffs<00:02:50.879> in<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.480> past<00:02:51.720> but<00:02:52.109> once<00:02:52.319> we

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
under the cliffs in the past but once we

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.349 
under the cliffs in the past but once we
we<00:02:52.890> saw<00:02:53.069> this<00:02:53.250> happen<00:02:53.910> for<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.359> first<00:02:54.540> time<00:02:56.359> we

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
we saw this happen for the first time we

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.610 
we saw this happen for the first time we
started<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.780> take<00:02:57.959> every<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.410> being

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
started to take every that being

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.910 
started to take every that being
precautions<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> bed<00:03:00.440> under<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.470> colony

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
precautions on the bed under the colony

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550 
precautions on the bed under the colony
with<00:03:02.069> us<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.549> now<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:02.760> do<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.060> take<00:03:03.930> various

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
with us so now we do we take various

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.380 
with us so now we do we take various
premium<00:03:04.890> make<00:03:05.129> sure<00:03:05.250> there's<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.519> fire<00:03:05.700> station

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
premium make sure there's a fire station

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.860 
premium make sure there's a fire station
nearby

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
nearby

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.960 
nearby
well<00:03:07.799> I'm<00:03:08.069> certain<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.489> isn't<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.849> first

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
well I'm certain that isn't the first

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.220 
well I'm certain that isn't the first
time<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.359> polar<00:03:09.540> bear<00:03:09.690> has<00:03:09.750> ever<00:03:09.900> been<00:03:10.079> on<00:03:10.200> a

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
time the polar bear has ever been on a

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.509 
time the polar bear has ever been on a
cliff<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.680> think<00:03:10.829> this<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.190> first<00:03:11.370> time

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
cliff I think this is the first time

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.430 
cliff I think this is the first time
that<00:03:11.549> we<00:03:11.760> were<00:03:11.849> around<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.150> witness<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.660> but<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
that we were around to witness it but it

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.420 
that we were around to witness it but it
does<00:03:13.620> seem<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.890> be<00:03:13.950> happening<00:03:14.250> more

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
does seem to be happening more

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.500 
does seem to be happening more
frequently<00:03:15.290> back<00:03:16.290> in<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.829> 1950s<00:03:17.519> when<00:03:17.760> people

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
frequently back in the 1950s when people

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.319 
frequently back in the 1950s when people
visited<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.989> colony<00:03:19.349> there<00:03:19.799> was<00:03:19.980> ice<00:03:20.329> right

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
visited the colony there was ice right

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.970 
visited the colony there was ice right
across<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.810> street<00:03:21.959> all<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> way<00:03:22.709> into<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
across the street all the way into the

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.909 
across the street all the way into the
Czech<00:03:23.160> careering<00:03:23.430> period<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.349> 80s<00:03:25.769> when

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
Czech careering period in the 80s when

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.400 
Czech careering period in the 80s when
this<00:03:26.040> research<00:03:26.370> started<00:03:26.959> ice<00:03:27.959> would<00:03:28.260> leave

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
this research started ice would leave

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680 
this research started ice would leave
sometime<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:28.980> July<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:29.669> it's<00:03:29.880> usually<00:03:30.269> in

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
sometime in July and now it's usually in

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.800 
sometime in July and now it's usually in
June<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.620> ice-free<00:03:32.010> period<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> lot<00:03:32.810> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
June so the ice-free period is a lot a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.349 
June so the ice-free period is a lot a
lot<00:03:34.139> longer<00:03:34.349> now<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:34.889> Hudson<00:03:35.220> Bay<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.609> because

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
lot longer now in Hudson Bay and because

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.960 
lot longer now in Hudson Bay and because
of<00:03:36.389> this<00:03:36.599> polar<00:03:37.290> bears<00:03:37.590> can't<00:03:37.859> you<00:03:38.730> don't<00:03:38.790> have

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of this polar bears can't you don't have

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.280 
of this polar bears can't you don't have
as<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.180> time<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.569> feed<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.870> seals<00:03:40.109> so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
as much time to feed on the seals so

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.259 
as much time to feed on the seals so
they're<00:03:40.410> having<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.769> switch<00:03:41.669> to<00:03:41.819> other<00:03:41.940> prey

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
they're having to switch to other prey

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.809 
they're having to switch to other prey
to<00:03:42.349> help<00:03:43.349> themselves<00:03:43.530> through<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.250> summer

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
to help themselves through the summer

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.240 
to help themselves through the summer
period<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> think<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.099> happening

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
period and so I think this is happening

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.910 
period and so I think this is happening
more<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.609> more<00:03:47.700> often
