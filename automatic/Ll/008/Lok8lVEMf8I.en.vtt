00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and just gets it ready so that when you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
and just gets it ready so that when you
get<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.530> ready<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.100> hook<00:01:27.030> up<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.420> run<00:01:27.689> now

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
get it it's ready to hook up and run now

you<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.720> assemble<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> base<00:01:31.650> right

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you do have to assemble the base right

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.960 
you do have to assemble the base right
here<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:33.630> part<00:01:33.990> needs<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.530> put<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
here that part needs to be put on and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.560 
here that part needs to be put on and
then<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.780> feed<00:01:37.049> chute<00:01:37.970> has<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.329> put

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
then the little feed chute has to be put

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
then the little feed chute has to be put
on<00:01:39.829> probably<00:01:40.829> ought<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> give<00:01:41.159> yourself<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
on probably ought to give yourself a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
on probably ought to give yourself a
couple<00:01:41.790> hours<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.380> may

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
couple hours to do that you know you may

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
couple hours to do that you know you may
think<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> big<00:01:45.180> deal<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
think it's not a big deal but this is

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.999 
think it's not a big deal but this is
850<00:01:47.490> pound<00:01:47.759> piece<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.299> machinery<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> know

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
850 pound piece of machinery so you know

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
850 pound piece of machinery so you know
it<00:01:50.280> took<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:50.820> while<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.360> it

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
it took me a little while to get it

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.679 
it took me a little while to get it
assembled<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.759> couple<00:01:53.759> hours<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> wasn't<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
assembled a couple hours it wasn't a

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.539 
assembled a couple hours it wasn't a
hard<00:01:55.470> job<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.219> little<00:01:56.460> bit<00:01:56.579> tedious<00:01:58.549> first

through it
checking<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:14.180> bearings<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:14.930> tolerances<00:04:15.620> and

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
checking the bearings and tolerances and

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.460 
checking the bearings and tolerances and
greasing<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.060> tightening<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.049> all<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.440> I

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
greasing and tightening and all that I

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.440 
greasing and tightening and all that I
think<00:04:18.829> it's<00:04:18.979> it's<00:04:19.400> worthwhile<00:04:19.669> so<00:04:20.209> that<00:04:20.359> one

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
think it's it's worthwhile so that one

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.750 
think it's it's worthwhile so that one
machine<00:04:20.780> arrives<00:04:21.169> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:22.430> know<00:04:22.520> just

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
machine arrives you can you know just

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.520 
machine arrives you can you know just
run<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.180> right<00:04:23.210> out<00:04:23.479> of<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.599> box

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
run it right out of the box

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.440 
run it right out of the box
I<00:04:24.590> think<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.610> should<00:04:25.790> allow<00:04:26.000> yourself<00:04:26.030> a

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
I think you should allow yourself a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.360 
I think you should allow yourself a
couple<00:04:26.780> hours<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.139> get<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.470> machine<00:04:27.770> unloaded

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
couple hours to get the machine unloaded

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.050 
couple hours to get the machine unloaded
and<00:04:28.490> unpacked<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:30.160> assembly<00:04:31.160> completed

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
and unpacked and the assembly completed

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.330 
and unpacked and the assembly completed
on<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.540> after<00:04:33.320> that<00:04:33.470> it's<00:04:33.710> ready<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.010> hook<00:04:34.100> up

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
on it after that it's ready to hook up

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.909 
on it after that it's ready to hook up
and<00:04:34.490> go<00:04:35.200> so<00:04:36.200> if<00:04:36.320> you're<00:04:36.440> ready<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.710> have<00:04:36.860> a
