00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 and the next part thirteenth fourth 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.990
 this is believed Saturday afternoon 15.30 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.540
 coface arena in mainz that is always 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 only ko phase 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:26.180
 I do not care what mainz 05 against the hsv 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.010
 So the last game has the game in it 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.270
 hamburg with 1 0 decided for themselves 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.510
 two goalless draws and a 4 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.920
 2-win for the mainzer and a 1 0 for 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.140
 the hansestÃ¤dter performance technically 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.910
 just both pretty weak to moderate 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.610
 Mainz 43 percent last that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 the defeat against nuremberg that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.829
 draw against bremen against 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.550
 hoffenheim 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.440
 the victory over leverkusen how should it 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 be different against 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 Dusseldorf against Freiburg in the cup after 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.430
 extension retired against the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 sports club from freiburg and again 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 two draw once against 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.450
 wolfsburg once against Schalke as well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.780
 against augsburg and then again one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.100
 defeat it from the second 2 against 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 the munich bayern with 3 to 0 of the hsv 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.079
 last matchday sovereign with single 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.880
 lost against freiburg before how should 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.680
 you call that 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:40.439
 protect against against the munich 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.909
 bavaria 19 2 lost there but you have 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.840
 Also seen again what manuel newer 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:53.280
 can not and these are simple balls 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:59.729
 otherwise the 1 0 against anyway one 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 sausage 1 1 0 via vfb stuttgart 1 1 1 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.280
 against the forte a 5 1 defeat 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.149
 against Hannover as well as a 1 0 victory against 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.329
 gladbach generally the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.329
 duels of the two mainz three wins five 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:19.230
 undecided 55 hamburger winner so 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.159
 slight tendency direction hsv we look 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.849
 times in the table 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:26.250
 tabular eighth is mainz with 39 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.010
 scores a point behind it on the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 Eleventh rank, however, is the HSV 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.549
 a whopping 15 goals worse placed mainz 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.549
 has plus 3 gates and the hsv - 12 the 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.329
 scorers at 1, bunga is already with 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.090
 Thirteen huts are the best archer behind 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.060
 ivanschitz with 6 nico mÃ¼ller with five 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.819
 noveski with 2 and marley with a goal 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.260
 there is to be said Ivanschitz 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.159
 just flirting with a bit 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.120
 Bremen will be well in contract in Mainz 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.500
 no longer extend 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.870
 that does not extend the want 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.620
 not extend otherwise maybe 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.680
 already go 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.590
 otherwise at hsv 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.680
 best scorer artjoms rudnevs the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.780
 last song with eleven goals but with 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.069
 nine beister and van der vaart respectively 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.180
 with 3 and heiko westermann with 2 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.349
 Look again at the injured 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.129
 past klasnic bogart and kubica 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.310
 pages of the mainzer at asv maxi beister 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.010
 still red locked and swede 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.900
 Marcus Berg with an injury and how 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.829
 looks freddy's tip for the duel in 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.829
 the coface arena 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.550
 hard to say 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.330
 I think 11 Hamburg so please 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.820
 does not seem to lose again 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.530
 not so great in shape 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:11.570
 only or maybe 2 2 but that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.570
 a draw says alright 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.340
 I'm typing on a 1 1 alone because 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.050
 mainzer undecided king is me 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.380
 think 14 draw already 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.380
 played
