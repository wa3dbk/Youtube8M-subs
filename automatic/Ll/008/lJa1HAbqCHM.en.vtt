 partner in the uv they gave bears are things 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.410
 of soccer thing that happened in obvious that 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.750
 the classic was death these were his 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.850
 textual words yes of course but 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.100
 not only everything I think we saw it and they 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.670
 they were also a mature day and how 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.670
 have to play a classic 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.020
 a tuit of yours people are commenting 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.370
 that was not even avalasen 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.480
 and if they asked me specifically 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.020
 no way why because if the 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.910
 history identified with alliance and that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.120
 it's good and I feel very comfortable already 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.480
 taste then I think that affection that 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.480
 I get people 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.229
 it would be something that is not part of me 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 so that's why I said at that time 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.200
 is someone from the 1 with intention 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.410
 I also do not expect people to side with me 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410
 want 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.490
 how strange of uruguay uruguay am 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.160
 very comfortable I think it's something something 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.960
 beautiful and very enjoyable and that makes me 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.760
 remember also what is uruguay the 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.590
 dulce de leche has been replaced by 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.160
 this but to the Lima the rice with milk 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:32.390
 a good porridge and the palate 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.390
 Peruvian chocolate matute 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.070
 is heard after a game of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.330
 Lima alliance to see what's in the 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.630
 traditional dressing rooms was always the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.630

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.980
 goodbye 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.469

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:27.139

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.139
 it matters how 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.120

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.990
 that all if you play Uruguayan soccer is 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.880
 very seasoned 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.070
