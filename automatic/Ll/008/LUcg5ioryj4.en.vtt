I'll wear it too with a tank top

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.770 
I'll wear it too with a tank top
underneath<00:04:36.670> and<00:04:37.000> it's<00:04:37.090> kind<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.330> nice<00:04:37.510> that

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
I also really like that for this type of

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.800 
I also really like that for this type of
thing<00:05:14.170> um<00:05:15.060> if<00:05:16.060> you're<00:05:16.180> putting<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.480> shirt<00:05:16.630> over

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
thing um if you're putting a shirt over

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.390 
thing um if you're putting a shirt over
it<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.200> actually<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.770> chance<00:05:17.980> to<00:05:18.100> come<00:05:18.250> up

a<00:05:18.460> little<00:05:18.610> bit<00:05:18.880> higher<00:05:19.060> because<00:05:19.240> I<00:05:19.420> find<00:05:19.600> it

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
a little bit higher because I find it

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.190 
a little bit higher because I find it
locks<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.040> loads<00:05:21.250> everything<00:05:21.760> if<00:05:22.540> you<00:05:23.080> know

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
what I mean uh-uh and then I'm just

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.240 
what I mean uh-uh and then I'm just
wearing<00:05:25.960> suede<00:05:27.510> flats<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:29.130> these<00:05:30.130> are
