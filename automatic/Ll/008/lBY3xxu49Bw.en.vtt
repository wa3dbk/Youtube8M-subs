it<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:38.010> plus<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:39.209> i<00:03:39.329> said

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
it and so and and plus like i said

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.800 
it and so and and plus like i said
before<00:03:39.919> you<00:03:40.919> know<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.519> not<00:03:42.359> just<00:03:42.599> that

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
before you know you have not just that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.620 
before you know you have not just that
but<00:03:43.049> then<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:44.549> way<00:03:44.700> that<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.359> i

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
but then you have the way that that i

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.309 
but then you have the way that that i
know<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.989> my<00:03:46.019> case<00:03:46.230> anyways<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.430> designers

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
know in my case anyways the designers

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.990 
know in my case anyways the designers
have<00:03:49.319> always<00:03:49.680> given<00:03:49.829> me<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.069> terrific<00:03:51.769> grade

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
have always given me a terrific grade

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.900 
have always given me a terrific grade
and<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.709> there's<00:03:56.190> certain<00:03:56.519> things<00:03:56.549> you

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
and and so there's certain things you

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.729 
and and so there's certain things you
can<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.239> in<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.419> game<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.379> just

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
can do in the game that are just

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.290 
can do in the game that are just
remarkable<00:03:59.280> with<00:03:59.910> certain<00:04:00.150> players<00:04:00.389> and

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
remarkable with certain players and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.620 
remarkable with certain players and
I<00:04:01.390> think<00:04:02.020> fans<00:04:02.230> really<00:04:02.440> get<00:04:02.650> into<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.630> but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
I think fans really get into that but

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.810 
I think fans really get into that but
but<00:04:04.810> again<00:04:05.080> it<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.320> it<00:04:05.710> just<00:04:05.770> captures<00:04:06.130> the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820
