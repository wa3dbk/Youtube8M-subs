ok<00:00:04.730> I've<00:00:04.970> just<00:00:05.150> woken<00:00:05.390> up<00:00:05.660> and<00:00:05.779> come<00:00:06.080> to<00:00:06.200> have<00:00:06.319> a

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
ok I've just woken up and come to have a

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.840 
ok I've just woken up and come to have a
look<00:00:06.379> at<00:00:06.589> the<00:00:06.680> swales<00:00:06.920> we've<00:00:07.190> had<00:00:07.339> quite<00:00:07.549> a<00:00:07.670> bit

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
look at the swales we've had quite a bit

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.490 
look at the swales we've had quite a bit
of<00:00:07.970> rain<00:00:08.120> overnight<00:00:08.570> we've<00:00:09.050> had<00:00:09.200> probably

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
of rain overnight we've had probably

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.610 
of rain overnight we've had probably
close<00:00:10.010> to<00:00:10.040> two<00:00:10.190> inches<00:00:11.139> these<00:00:12.139> whales<00:00:12.410> were

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
close to two inches these whales were

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.740 
close to two inches these whales were
put<00:00:12.800> in<00:00:12.920> nearly<00:00:13.190> a<00:00:13.219> week<00:00:13.429> ago<00:00:13.790> or<00:00:13.910> haven't<00:00:14.450> due

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
put in nearly a week ago or haven't due

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.999 
put in nearly a week ago or haven't due
to<00:00:14.840> work<00:00:14.990> commitments<00:00:15.019> and<00:00:15.559> that<00:00:15.679> I<00:00:15.710> haven't

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
to work commitments and that I haven't

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.740 
to work commitments and that I haven't
had<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.279> full<00:00:16.580> opportunity<00:00:16.850> to<00:00:17.270> get<00:00:17.390> in<00:00:17.539> and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
had the full opportunity to get in and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.570 
had the full opportunity to get in and
clean<00:00:17.779> them<00:00:17.960> up<00:00:18.230> as<00:00:18.410> I'd<00:00:18.560> like<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:18.830> that<00:00:19.279> will

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
clean them up as I'd like but that will

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.540 
clean them up as I'd like but that will
be<00:00:19.609> happening<00:00:19.850> in<00:00:20.119> coming<00:00:20.480> days<00:00:21.430> but<00:00:22.430> it's

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
be happening in coming days but it's

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.340 
be happening in coming days but it's
just<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.840> testament<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.080> power<00:00:24.109> of

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
just the testament to the power of

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.320 
just the testament to the power of
swales<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.130> how<00:00:25.250> well<00:00:25.460> they<00:00:25.609> actually<00:00:26.090> work

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
swales and how well they actually work

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.240 
swales and how well they actually work
you<00:00:26.630> can<00:00:26.779> see<00:00:27.050> there's<00:00:27.320> quite<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.710> bit<00:00:27.800> of<00:00:27.949> water

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
you can see there's quite a bit of water

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.370 
you can see there's quite a bit of water
in<00:00:28.460> this<00:00:29.830> and<00:00:31.480> probably<00:00:32.480> up<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:32.840> four<00:00:33.079> inches

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
in this and probably up to four inches

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.530 
in this and probably up to four inches
in<00:00:33.590> spots<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.640> it's<00:00:34.760> looking<00:00:34.910> good<00:00:35.239> I'm

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
in spots and it's looking good I'm

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.270 
in spots and it's looking good I'm
really<00:00:35.899> happy<00:00:36.200> with<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:38.980> when<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.219> happens

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
really happy with it when this happens

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.920 
really happy with it when this happens
it's<00:00:40.790> a<00:00:40.879> good<00:00:41.030> idea<00:00:41.149> like<00:00:41.629> in<00:00:41.780> all

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
it's a good idea like in all

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.540 
it's a good idea like in all
permaculture<00:00:42.469> things<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.040> come<00:00:43.219> out<00:00:43.430> and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
permaculture things to come out and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.700 
permaculture things to come out and
observe<00:00:43.700> what's<00:00:44.270> going<00:00:44.360> on<00:00:44.809> where's<00:00:45.530> the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
observe what's going on where's the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.580 
observe what's going on where's the
water<00:00:45.890> coming<00:00:46.010> from<00:00:47.020> it's<00:00:48.020> also<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.350> good<00:00:48.530> idea

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
water coming from it's also a good idea

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.110 
water coming from it's also a good idea
with<00:00:49.039> new<00:00:49.219> swales<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.289> fully<00:00:51.289> plug<00:00:51.649> up

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
with new swales just to fully plug up

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.000 
with new swales just to fully plug up
any<00:00:53.120> spots<00:00:53.629> where<00:00:53.870> there<00:00:54.110> might<00:00:54.260> be<00:00:54.320> some

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
any spots where there might be some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.650 
any spots where there might be some
little<00:00:55.129> holes<00:00:55.430> in<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.789> mounds<00:00:56.180> or<00:00:56.270> anything

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
little holes in the mounds or anything

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.420 
little holes in the mounds or anything
like<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.640> also<00:01:00.010> observe<00:01:01.010> where<00:01:01.309> your

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
like that and also observe where your

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.429 
like that and also observe where your
water's<00:01:01.760> coming<00:01:02.090> from<00:01:03.009> as<00:01:04.009> we<00:01:04.280> walk<00:01:04.489> up<00:01:04.760> here

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
water's coming from as we walk up here

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.020 
water's coming from as we walk up here
as<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:06.830> can<00:01:06.950> see<00:01:07.220> we're<00:01:07.369> getting<00:01:07.610> closer<00:01:07.850> to

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
as you can see we're getting closer to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.100 
as you can see we're getting closer to
the<00:01:08.180> fence<00:01:08.540> line<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.970> clock<00:01:11.270> subsequently

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the fence line and clock subsequently

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.539 
the fence line and clock subsequently
closer<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.799> road<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.220> that's<00:01:13.340> where<00:01:13.520> a

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
closer to the road and that's where a

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.450 
closer to the road and that's where a
lot<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.939> road<00:01:14.299> runoff<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.930> coming<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.340> if

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
lot of the road runoff is coming and if

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.399 
lot of the road runoff is coming and if
we<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.759> close<00:01:17.060> look<00:01:17.270> down<00:01:17.570> here<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:21.200> we

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
we have a close look down here and we

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.039 
we have a close look down here and we
can<00:01:21.619> see<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.250> little<00:01:22.670> rivulet<00:01:23.030> of<00:01:23.090> water<00:01:23.600> it's

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
can see a little rivulet of water it's

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.410 
can see a little rivulet of water it's
just<00:01:24.200> running<00:01:24.500> off<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.650> road<00:01:24.920> now<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.090> haven't

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
just running off the road now I haven't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.230 
just running off the road now I haven't
done<00:01:26.570> any<00:01:26.780> work<00:01:26.990> at<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:27.320> thus<00:01:28.220> far<00:01:28.520> to

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
done any work at all thus far to

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.020 
done any work at all thus far to
basically<00:01:29.710> tap<00:01:30.710> into<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.159> road<00:01:31.400> if<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:31.820> have<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
basically tap into the road if we have a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.770 
basically tap into the road if we have a
little<00:01:32.840> walk<00:01:33.079> up<00:01:33.320> here<00:01:34.360> we'll<00:01:35.360> see<00:01:35.540> there's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
little walk up here we'll see there's

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.719 
little walk up here we'll see there's
the<00:01:35.960> road<00:01:36.140> over<00:01:36.380> there<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:39.729> gutter

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
the road over there and that the gutter

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.580 
the road over there and that the gutter
a<00:01:41.060> little<00:01:41.420> gully<00:01:41.630> next<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.200> road<00:01:42.409> is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
a little gully next to the road is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.330 
a little gully next to the road is
running<00:01:43.549> quite<00:01:43.820> hard<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:45.439> that<00:01:45.649> will<00:01:45.860> do<00:01:46.070> that

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
running quite hard and that will do that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.969 
running quite hard and that will do that
around<00:01:46.909> here<00:01:47.329> after<00:01:47.689> about<00:01:47.930> half<00:01:47.990> inch<00:01:48.500> of

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
around here after about half inch of

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.940 
around here after about half inch of
rain<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:51.020> what<00:01:51.259> I'm<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.530> do<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:51.799> do

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
rain and so what I'm going to do is do

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.679 
rain and so what I'm going to do is do
some<00:01:52.100> little<00:01:52.250> diversion<00:01:52.820> tunnel<00:01:53.180> channels

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
some little diversion tunnel channels

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.200 
some little diversion tunnel channels
from<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.049> road<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.619> divert<00:01:54.860> that<00:01:54.890> water<00:01:55.310> into

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
from the road and divert that water into

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.560 
from the road and divert that water into
each<00:01:56.540> swale<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.759> time<00:01:58.969> we<00:01:59.119> get<00:01:59.299> over

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
each swale so then in time we get over

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.840 
each swale so then in time we get over
an<00:01:59.659> inch<00:01:59.780> of<00:01:59.930> rain<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.860> swales<00:02:01.430> will<00:02:01.670> just

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
an inch of rain the swales will just

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.929 
an inch of rain the swales will just
fill<00:02:02.270> up<00:02:02.299> very<00:02:02.659> quickly<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.140> easily<00:02:03.939> now

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
fill up very quickly and easily now

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.990 
fill up very quickly and easily now
another<00:02:05.210> issue<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:06.219> look<00:02:07.219> in<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.549> type<00:02:07.969> of

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
another issue to look in that type of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.110 
another issue to look in that type of
scenario<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:09.220> where<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> water's<00:02:10.640> coming<00:02:11.030> in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
scenario is where the water's coming in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.850 
scenario is where the water's coming in
you<00:02:11.239> can<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.540> even<00:02:11.780> after<00:02:12.140> this<00:02:12.260> small<00:02:12.590> event

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
you can see even after this small event

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.090 
you can see even after this small event
is

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.460 
is
a<00:02:13.130> little<00:02:13.580> bit<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.730> an<00:02:13.880> erosion<00:02:14.390> issue<00:02:14.570> so<00:02:15.320> what

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
a little bit of an erosion issue so what

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.230 
a little bit of an erosion issue so what
what<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:15.980> will<00:02:16.190> do<00:02:16.400> we'll<00:02:16.790> put<00:02:16.970> some<00:02:17.120> little

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
what we will do we'll put some little

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.180 
what we will do we'll put some little
rocks<00:02:17.570> up<00:02:17.810> here<00:02:17.990> closer<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> grass<00:02:18.890> and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
rocks up here closer to the grass and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.030 
rocks up here closer to the grass and
create<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.520> little<00:02:19.730> gabion<00:02:20.470> which<00:02:21.470> will<00:02:21.680> slow

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
create a little gabion which will slow

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.620 
create a little gabion which will slow
that<00:02:22.400> water<00:02:22.640> down<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:23.180> let<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.450> trickle

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
that water down and this let it trickle

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.900 
that water down and this let it trickle
in<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.960> lot<00:02:24.140> more<00:02:24.260> gently<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.520> doesn't<00:02:25.700> have

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
in a lot more gently so it doesn't have

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.340 
in a lot more gently so it doesn't have
any<00:02:26.090> longer<00:02:26.450> term<00:02:26.630> erosion<00:02:27.170> impact<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:30.170> other

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
any longer term erosion impact but other

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.570 
any longer term erosion impact but other
than<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.920> really<00:02:31.220> good<00:02:31.370> result

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
than that this is a really good result

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.700 
than that this is a really good result
and<00:02:32.000> I'm<00:02:32.480> really<00:02:32.810> happy<00:02:33.020> with<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.590> these

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
and I'm really happy with it and these

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.690 
and I'm really happy with it and these
files<00:02:34.010> are<00:02:34.160> going<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.370> work<00:02:34.490> tremendously

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
files are going to work tremendously

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.540 
files are going to work tremendously
well<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.230> can<00:02:36.290> probably<00:02:36.800> get<00:02:37.070> a<00:02:37.100> better

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
well so you can probably get a better

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.310 
well so you can probably get a better
picture<00:02:37.850> Nair<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.480> benefit<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:38.930> swales

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
picture Nair of the benefit of swales

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.800 
picture Nair of the benefit of swales
and<00:02:39.710> just<00:02:40.520> what<00:02:40.700> they<00:02:40.820> can<00:02:41.060> do<00:02:41.300> it's<00:02:42.170> fantastic
