00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.590
 in this course 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.850
 less luxuriant 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.860
 Great pleasure to be here with you. 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.269
 once again 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.579
 I'm going to do a five string snack was after 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.060
 Podcast for you 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.880
 of course not 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.070
 every week 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.630
 a voter delirium not for you 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.539
 photographic effects to borrow 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.569
 So 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.490
 people who come to give up 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.000
 this power that we think this is very easy 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 cool beauty are gonÃ§alo that you 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.659
 the whole conception of how to work with the whole process. 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.659
 photographic defects faults the test 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.690
 those people who are starting 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.290
 working with photoshop 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.129
 nothing better than being able to use 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.780
 there is nothing better than knowing how to use the proper Chinese tools 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.920
 gutters and grab 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.910
 to the excellent result indeed 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.819
 So I'll wait for day care and today. 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.720
 I'm going to teach how to work for fear of contagion 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.989
 letting leave your photo 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.750
 an even better quality with regard to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.170
 increased shopping traffic closures 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.950
 look that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 I'm with an image that is normal takeshita to do 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.350
 I'll come here 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.860
 for my fill with layer fit in click here I will work on 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.340
 black and white looks lonely 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.180
 working to break the chain 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.510
 as we already have a technical quality and is not supposed killer 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.320
 pedophile is celebrated 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.899
 Good, but I'll stay here I came here. 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.140
 where do you have 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 in my way to merge working in indirect light 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.390
 just this process that I did 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.429
 black and white and then 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.929
 the way to merge to work with the former director can only with us already 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:50.720
 got 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.960
 an excellent result can not often be thought because this is not 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.750
 Photography I'm here is very cool. 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.920
 a sharp clarity not with the tragic idea 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.340
 It is true that many times they fought in the photo with our machine 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.150
 be of extreme quality a digital machine is his from small to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.210
 also here abroad 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.219
 good results 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.639
 We have this design, but I'm really cool, but with the 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.339
 people come here in photoshop get teles tools some people 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:24.779
 begins to realize that 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 what we took out 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.050
 in the coming weeks 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.390
 but in fact I think it can bring this excellent multiplied result 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.870
 for four five 10 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.299
 or who knows more in fact then the 5th generation ap 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.930
 this one but the original 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.720
 working with black and white and with a one-month tragic indirect light mode 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.990
 look how much difference we have made our image even better in the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.859
 truth 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.399
 But it did not stop there. 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.770
 with people here 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.340
 Look, I just worked for a black-and-white to see my father leave me. 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.899
 white if the door is working with 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.379
 any cult 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.260
 these 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.069
 and 15 red yellow green cyan-south total image handle manipulating 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.430
 what I recommend in the team you can have a greater control 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.909
 through these adjustments aiming here 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.820
 You have to think what we buy in you click on it 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.049
 and will be able to work on that 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.020
 of the points that you think of the step by increasing or decreasing this contrast 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.390
 for example they are here 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.860
 it is essential that leaves you in a bit more correct I click here togo 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:36.389
 the pussy 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.290
 course owners and press the left mouse button duck 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.449
 I said here 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.389
 Allah 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.379
 in the ninth layer on the adjustment panel the military cinema marked there as I go 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.900
 enter the league and goes through 5 percent 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.570
 six of the seven people 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.799
 and here it is opposite increasing 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.819
 or decreasing 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.019
 look at the contrast 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.519
 in the poorest way you can work 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.349
 Tokyo 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.039
 I want to leave more or less what leaves the sky 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.659
 well less than a month work more or less here in 138 points 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.669
 if she wants to do better, the guy picks up this water that I say has a 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:11.800
 reflection here 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.379
 popov by clicking on it 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.970
 and I will slightly reduce the reflexes in the military pebble did not want to leave 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.049
 so it diminishes a little more so here I am also working in the cinema 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.699
 work here more or less 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.379
 what are you? 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.349
 15 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.879
 then little more contraries 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.879
 muller now working with the southern hollow 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.340
 the program we call here is what we can differentiate between deaths 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.820
 Then just talk how the result was 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.919
 really cool actually 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.659

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.680
 with the palmeitras 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.570
 the contrast here in photoshop cs5 this year 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.420
 I left more 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.669
 even more qualified with 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.740
 quality even more in the helium coast table why I hope you have 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.839
