00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.599
 apply your foundation on 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.799
 your entire face then matify 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.020
 all using a powder 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.850
 choose a concealer in a circle and 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.830
 your eyebrows then redraw their shape 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.440
 I take a white make-up that I'm going 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.300
 blurred under the request of the eyebrow I 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.110
 put an eye base and then I 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.599
 choose the golden lighthouse 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.610
 I put a lighthouse powder is so white 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.770
 golden is again the golden lighthouse 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.329
 metal 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.130
 I take an orange lighthouse and I'm going 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.310
 come dimmed in the hollow of the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.310
 eyelid 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.280
 I choose a fishing lighthouse for rest we 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.170
 pay again on it I take a lighthouse 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.060
 cathy I 'm going to come degrade it in the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.170
 outer corner of the eye and then blurred it to 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.170
 again in the hollow of the eyelid 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.979
 I take a yellow lighthouse could 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.049
 step up the golden side I take a 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.640
 lighthouse fat that I'm going to put in 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.250
 the inner corner of the eye and pull them 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.549
 to the middle I then take a 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.020
 lighthouse darker so electric that I 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.450
 will put in the mucosa and pulled in 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.540
 high liner I stepped with a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.820
 pencil and my eyeliner I take a red 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.159

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.780
 I add a beautiful diamond powder 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.960

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.130
 the fossils so we are finalizing the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.350
 dyed with a touring tale so we 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.090
 let's play with the lights and the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.490
 shadows in order to refine our features of 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.990
 face 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.900

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.909
 all so a bluff pretty red for my 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.650

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.409
 rings that I'm going to drop on my 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.190

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:15.740
