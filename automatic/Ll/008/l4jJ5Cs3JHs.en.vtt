now finishing h and r dot m this is a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.230 
now finishing h and r dot m this is a
little<00:02:32.040> more<00:02:32.160> complicated<00:02:32.460> like<00:02:32.850> i<00:02:32.940> said<00:02:33.090> it's

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
little more complicated like i said it's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.360 
little more complicated like i said it's
not<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:33.990> line<00:02:34.200> after<00:02:34.860> our<00:02:34.980> interface

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
not just one line after our interface

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.740 
not just one line after our interface
builder<00:02:35.580> action<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.970> locating<00:02:36.360> me<00:02:36.420> after<00:02:36.630> its

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
builder action of locating me after its

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.420 
builder action of locating me after its
first<00:02:36.870> curly<00:02:37.170> bracket<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.800> enter<00:02:38.040> two<00:02:38.190> times

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
first curly bracket and enter two times

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.850 
first curly bracket and enter two times
and<00:02:38.750> i<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.260> five<00:02:40.560> lines

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and i think this is like five lines

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.920 
and i think this is like five lines
actually<00:02:41.210> it's<00:02:42.210> NS<00:02:42.960> string<00:02:43.460> address<00:02:44.460> text

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
actually it's NS string address text

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.680 
actually it's NS string address text

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and the % @ is telling the code that and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.960 
and the % @ is telling the code that and
this<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.540> percent<00:04:04.140> at<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.970> been

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
this is the percent at that it's been

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.540 
this is the percent at that it's been
named<00:04:06.270> so<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.170> puts<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.590> %<00:04:07.980> @<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.280> i<00:04:08.370> said

told up down there and on the next slime
just<00:04:15.690> in<00:04:15.780> case<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.080> doesn't<00:04:16.260> work<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.799> I'm<00:04:17.040> not

just in case it doesn't work and I'm not

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.590 
just in case it doesn't work and I'm not
sure<00:04:17.430> if<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.030> do<00:04:18.180> anything<00:04:18.419> in

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
sure if this is going to do anything in

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.530 
sure if this is going to do anything in
our<00:04:18.690> simulator<00:04:19.080> but<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.440> NS<00:04:19.890> log<00:04:20.190> URL<00:04:21.150> text

I'm<00:04:32.949> pretty<00:04:33.160> sure<00:04:33.340> that's<00:04:33.490> not<00:04:33.580> going<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.880> do

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
I'm pretty sure that's not going to do

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.280 
I'm pretty sure that's not going to do
anything<00:04:34.180> because<00:04:34.360> there's<00:04:34.660> no<00:04:34.810> text<00:04:35.110> there

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
anything because there's no text there

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.159 
anything because there's no text there
anyway<00:04:36.100> we're<00:04:36.250> going<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.430> build<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:36.759> go<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
anyway we're going to build and go and

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.659 
anyway we're going to build and go and
save<00:04:38.169> all<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:39.610> just<00:04:39.789> going<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.030> compile

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
save all and it's just going to compile

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.499 
save all and it's just going to compile
probably<00:04:42.669> not<00:04:42.789> going<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:43.000> do<00:04:43.120> anything<00:04:43.270> but<00:04:43.360> if

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
probably not going to do anything but if

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.900 
probably not going to do anything but if
we<00:04:43.600> click<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> button<00:04:44.169> oh<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:45.400> does<00:04:45.580> take<00:04:45.789> the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
we click the button oh it does take the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.779 
we click the button oh it does take the
user<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.389> Google<00:04:46.720> Maps<00:04:46.900> oh<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.490> guess<00:04:48.669> it

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
user to Google Maps oh so I guess it

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.080 
user to Google Maps oh so I guess it
does<00:04:48.940> work<00:04:49.120> after<00:04:49.449> all<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:50.729> it's<00:04:51.729> going<00:04:52.000> to

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
does work after all so it's going to

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.090 
does work after all so it's going to
work<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.479> simulator<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.139> if<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.979> user

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
work in the simulator and if the user

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.770 
work in the simulator and if the user
didn't<00:04:54.430> have<00:04:54.550> google<00:04:54.669> maps<00:04:55.000> i'm<00:04:55.240> not<00:04:55.389> sure<00:04:55.600> if

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
didn't have google maps i'm not sure if

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.460 
didn't have google maps i'm not sure if
maybe<00:04:56.050> some<00:04:56.680> of<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.860> older<00:04:57.220> versions<00:04:57.639> of<00:04:58.470> some

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
maybe some of the older versions of some

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.689 
maybe some of the older versions of some
of<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.680> older<00:04:59.889> versions<00:05:00.190> of<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.370> ipod<00:05:00.669> touch

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
of the older versions of the ipod touch

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.790 
of the older versions of the ipod touch
don't<00:05:01.090> have<00:05:01.300> maps<00:05:01.539> this<00:05:02.050> will<00:05:02.260> work<00:05:02.380> instead

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
don't have maps this will work instead

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.900 
don't have maps this will work instead
it'll<00:05:03.010> take<00:05:03.190> them<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> safari<00:05:03.940> version<00:05:04.800> so

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
it'll take them to the safari version so

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.189 
it'll take them to the safari version so
that's<00:05:06.910> basically<00:05:07.090> had<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.449> link<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:07.810> maps<00:05:08.020> in

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
that's basically had a link to maps in

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.960 
that's basically had a link to maps in
your<00:05:08.289> application<00:05:08.710> but<00:05:08.860> like<00:05:09.130> i<00:05:09.250> said<00:05:09.280> instead

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
your application but like i said instead

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.060 
your application but like i said instead
of<00:05:10.030> this<00:05:10.240> coming<00:05:10.510> up<00:05:10.720> if<00:05:11.530> you<00:05:11.680> want<00:05:11.830> an<00:05:11.919> actual

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
of this coming up if you want an actual

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.710 
of this coming up if you want an actual
ipod<00:05:12.460> touch<00:05:12.729> or<00:05:12.940> an<00:05:13.030> iphone<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.479> had<00:05:13.600> the

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
ipod touch or an iphone that had the

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.120 
ipod touch or an iphone that had the
maps<00:05:13.930> application<00:05:14.139> it<00:05:14.500> would<00:05:14.590> go<00:05:14.710> directly<00:05:14.979> to

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
maps application it would go directly to

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.969 
maps application it would go directly to
the<00:05:15.160> maps<00:05:15.430> application<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:17.440> that's<00:05:17.830> basically

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
the maps application so that's basically

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.650 
the maps application so that's basically
how<00:05:18.190> to<00:05:18.430> link<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:18.729> maps<00:05:18.940> in<00:05:19.090> your<00:05:19.180> application

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
how to link to maps in your application

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.640 
how to link to maps in your application
if<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.810> have<00:05:19.900> any<00:05:20.050> questions<00:05:20.410> or<00:05:20.470> comments
