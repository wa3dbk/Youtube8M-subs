00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
black is definitely going to be at least

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
black is definitely going to be at least
the<00:00:23.939> white<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.900> people<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.410> said<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the white some people have said that

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.650 
the white some people have said that
there's<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> make<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> blue<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.359> pink

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there's going to make a blue or a pink

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870 
there's going to make a blue or a pink
but<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.140> highly<00:00:28.410> doubt<00:00:28.710> cuz<00:00:29.369> there's<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> case

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
but I highly doubt cuz there's a case

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640 
but I highly doubt cuz there's a case
for<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.779> don't<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.170> need<00:00:31.410> them

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
for that so you don't really need them

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.180 
for that so you don't really need them
um<00:00:33.170> product<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.649> color<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
um product to actually have that color I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
um product to actually have that color I
think<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> useless<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.390> as<00:00:36.840> long

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
think that's kind of useless but as long

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.180 
think that's kind of useless but as long
as<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> white<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> black<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.890> think

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
as they have a white and a black I think

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.470 
as they have a white and a black I think
that<00:00:38.280> should<00:00:38.399> cover<00:00:38.579> basically<00:00:38.940> every<00:00:39.239> color

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that should cover basically every color

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
that should cover basically every color
make<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.469> look<00:00:40.559> better<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.100> each<00:00:41.460> case

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
make it look better with them each case

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
make it look better with them each case
um<00:00:42.120> another<00:00:42.780> rumor<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.219> camera<00:00:47.219> so
