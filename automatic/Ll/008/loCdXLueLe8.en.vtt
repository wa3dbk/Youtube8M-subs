00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.870
 then the panel and in the hours I always 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.510
 I was sick, something I always 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.800
 to work hard there gives that wear 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.539
 It's the sick son. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.689
 that's when I got sick or did it 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.060
 something manual like that and then I was a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.529
 I made a discovery of my own 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.939
 Calling who I am much happier 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.210
 doing something that I'm 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.820
 creating something like this 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 then for us there is a beginning of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.899
 year to join all the last collective 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.940
 time that I did not have anymore were all 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
 of the same class and each was from the group 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.520
 You know, but we were always together and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.100
 then he turned it and has all the proposals 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.860
 of each of the small groups still 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.379
 remain alive within the collective because 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.460
 has long should the cootarde 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.159
 girls have an idea of ​​meeting in 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 home is king of the uterus club 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.930
 we meet only talks nonsense 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 woman is the history of the interventions 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.920
 which is very strong at point 3 of the law 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.920
 said 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.350
 is not doing nothing to bring 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.570
 Another time you do not stop to think 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 very much knows that this real time in 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.780
 true, I have years, it's the time that the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.400
 Your hand takes time to do this is that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.590
 time knows if it can be a little bit longer 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.690
 fast but it has a limit and I think 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 thing is a limits thing know 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.369
 timeout limit to people 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.940
 especially girls who 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.950
 it always so much with tendonitis not 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.220
 It's because an hour comes that it's a thing. 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.970
 physics knows his body he will have a 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:02.530
 place knows if the day ends the hour knows 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.770
 so it's too much is a very present thing 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.100
 for people who do not have the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.509
 not think about it so you know what the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.230
 that we also love that the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.989
 people emphasize habitation to accelerate with 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.519
 three years insisting me sometimes 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.650
 We talk and I do not want to see the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.790
 cell phone even water and not 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.680
 know bears an intimate relationship with 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.030
 time between having to have a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.450
 patience that have limits inhabit the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.940
 twice as dalila is to understand that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.680
 you come back that the cough is a mistake thing is 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.170
 well, one thing we always talk about 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.360
 that here, especially here 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.430
 tricolor is a knitting crochet any 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.500
 manual technique is a humility that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.090
 people have in the night life went on wrong 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.489
 I can go back and I can do it 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.470
 do much better this way and that 's a 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.459
 question I think I as a teacher I 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.430
 I notice as soon as we have much 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.720
 very industrial thinking so the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.590
 people who come looking to do 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.470
 knitting 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.150
 they get here a lot so she missed it 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.549
 It was but I stayed five hours doing 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.560
 You will now have to dismantle the country 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.780
 But it was five o'clock for hot girls. 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.299
 and now you will have this chance to do 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.130
 everything is new and better but it's a 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.720
 very thought that's in here 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.730
 inside that always comes white in the head 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.340
 It's all very tiring I spent five hours at the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.490
 However it spent five hours the bridge had 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.020
 five hours today union 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.240
 and now there are five more hours to 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.730
 improve what you have done and healthy 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.230
 This is the truth, I think the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.690
 handwork 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.070
 I really wanted this so you get frustrated 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:44.070
 A little breath, breathe again. 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:48.420
 I go back to the point and do not listen. 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.880
 do not come out right under a several attempts 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.880
 You'll get there to do this. 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.990
 in life that we do not even nowadays 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.480
 the less we have these various 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.240
 tries we want a hit made 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.240
 immediately median is so is grandchild 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.220
 The whole thing about being afraid of making mistakes is 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.430
 only who ends up being the people who 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.130
 they copy on the farm the sink is because 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.020
 ego she is afraid to make a mistake and they talk 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.670
 much does it light up when you made the conflict 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.350
 ongoing from England when they 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.850
 They talked too much, the error is not a mistake. 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.080
 it's a new hit 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.489
 So when people stay here 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.710
 with me mainly in class always 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.270
 I say there is no error, there are proposals 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.540
 different that was going to do something 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.910
 happened, another knows but wants to go back to 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.800
 that she can come back if it will not happen 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.700
 again then learning really is 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.590
 no mistake 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.590
 implementation at times when 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.160
 right is done in ready finalized 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.060
 I think that's the way it is 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.600
 But I think we have to look for it. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.490
 process 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.380
 I think there's a relationship 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.480
 Sunday 9 that so this kind of 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.280
 really even because I had not spoken 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.710
 before making their own food and everything 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.050
 there is a lot of this relationship but a duty 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.360
 all things with a look like that is not 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.980
 certainly what we really want 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.810
 We really do have goals then we 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.730
 also begin to see what is right for 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.710
 people to people because I really like 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.420
 when we mess with everything wires 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.480
 What I really want and what's there 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.580
 I also saw something like that I do not know the 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.680
 Wired work but then there is a stay 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.500
 more expensive but it is natural but they 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.540
 here suddenly I'm going to mess with him for 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.860
 hours and hours of the day then he that I 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.870
 I want this is what I want 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.580
 when we went there at least I'm 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.740
 in a store that today I have a lot 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.900
 the wettest said our beacon has 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.680
 a bad finish like I work 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.690
 with that 's what I do 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.190
 A business in my house will not work. 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.080
 changing everything so we go looking for 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:50.460
 for all of us around 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:50.460
 this improvement and simply 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.290
 piu-piu other steam areas so this 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.290
 played 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.210
 Let's try and we will. 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.789
 the nec is missing is easy to find 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.980
 Congonhas people who like this know 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:18.620
 that favors type s 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:21.110
 this power of choice of the 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.850
 you can choose the thing to do the 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.390
 way to make a control 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:31.010
 zé knows and I'm proud to finish 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:34.610
 a party goes this is reflected in the way 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:40.889
 as the china in the streets people in the queue is 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:43.620
 What is something like that, I think it's great. 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.930
 now you win the gang over 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.770
 impact you are doing here with the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.080
 embroidered crochet frame there what he called 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:55.260
 you give much more value to these things 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.360
 in the life that you 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.550
 Here is how we currently only 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.350
 if it is exchanged it is something that a 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.180
 time for another Brazilian 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:10.030
 she's super this 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.030
 It's not easy, we find ourselves 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:18.660
 besides learning I learned now is in the 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.729
 time to make a blouse and the crisis taught 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.720
 to all the friends together how to do this 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.780
 blouse 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.840
 We met her and that 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.500
 blouse was nick flux from a series of 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.990
 very happy meetings so you can talk 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.569
 a bout he 's a boy too 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:40.470
 that has what you are going to buy one 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:44.150
 a logic makes international fashion gives 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.150
 a different relationship
