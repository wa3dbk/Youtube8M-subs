well Martello head Chico tanks life has

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.560 
well Martello head Chico tanks life has
come<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.199> many<00:00:28.470> forms<00:00:29.090> and<00:00:30.090> one<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
come in many forms and one of the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.229 
come in many forms and one of the
questions<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:32.009> ask<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:33.090> it

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
questions that we would ask is was it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.940 
questions that we would ask is was it
under<00:00:33.390> acceleration<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.710> under

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
under acceleration or was it under

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.580 
under acceleration or was it under
deceleration<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.059> simply<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.079> riding<00:00:37.440> along

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
deceleration or simply just riding along

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
deceleration or simply just riding along
the<00:00:37.829> road<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.460> into<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> tank-slapper<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the road you go into a tank-slapper and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.680 
the road you go into a tank-slapper and
things<00:00:40.590> changed<00:00:41.309> where<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> changing<00:00:42.329> gear

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
things changed where you changing gear

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.900 
things changed where you changing gear
there's<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.770> kinds<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> things<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> look<00:00:44.730> at

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
there's all kinds of things to look at

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
there's all kinds of things to look at
here<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.510> why<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.780> happens<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.440> let's<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here as to why it happens so let's go to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
here as to why it happens so let's go to
the<00:00:46.950> root<00:00:47.100> causes<00:00:47.690> start<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> simple<00:00:49.289> one

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the root causes start with a simple one

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
the root causes start with a simple one
first<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.129> geometry<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> bike<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.180> flawed

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
first the geometry of the bike is flawed

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.139 
first the geometry of the bike is flawed
because<00:00:51.960> sag<00:00:52.440> isn't<00:00:52.770> set<00:00:52.949> correctly<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.879> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
because sag isn't set correctly or you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
because sag isn't set correctly or you
could<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.960> sag<00:00:55.230> quite<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.520> will

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
could not get sag quite right that will

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.979 
could not get sag quite right that will
mean<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.180> back<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> bike<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
mean that the back of the bike is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.389 
mean that the back of the bike is
sitting<00:00:58.350> low<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.800> front<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> bike

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
sitting low the front of the bike

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
sitting low the front of the bike
sitting<00:00:59.699> high<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.930> hit<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> bump<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.010> front

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
sitting high you hit a bump the front

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
sitting high you hit a bump the front
because<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.940> too<00:01:03.090> stiff<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.449> flex<00:01:04.110> off<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
because it's too stiff to flex off the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.399 
because it's too stiff to flex off the
bump<00:01:05.390> causing<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> wheel<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.900> turn<00:01:06.930> slightly

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
bump causing the wheel to turn slightly

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.789 
bump causing the wheel to turn slightly
sideways<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.400> lands<00:01:09.170> obviously<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
sideways it lands obviously not in a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.560 
sideways it lands obviously not in a
straight<00:01:11.100> line<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> tank-slapper

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
straight line and then a tank-slapper

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
straight line and then a tank-slapper
ensues<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.159> that's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.460> geometric

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
ensues from that so that's a geometric

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.950 
ensues from that so that's a geometric
cause<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.710> problem<00:01:17.450> next<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.750> look

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
cause of the problem next you would look

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.950 
cause of the problem next you would look
at<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.700> converse<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.450> back<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
at is actually the converse the back is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.890 
at is actually the converse the back is
too<00:01:22.170> stiff<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> front<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.130> too<00:01:23.340> soft<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
too stiff the front is too soft the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.440 
too stiff the front is too soft the
front<00:01:25.380> hits<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> bump<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.340> lifts<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.210> whole

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
front hits a bump it lifts the whole

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
front hits a bump it lifts the whole
front<00:01:27.840> end<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> air<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.799> sets<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.220> again

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
front end in the air which sets it again

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
front end in the air which sets it again
sideways<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.420> again<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> same

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
sideways and again you get the same

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
sideways and again you get the same
result<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> tank-slapper<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.570> try<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
result of a tank-slapper and try to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
result of a tank-slapper and try to
control<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.600> lot<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.630> times<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
control that a lot of times I see it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
control that a lot of times I see it
actually<00:01:37.740> under<00:01:37.920> acceleration<00:01:38.700> where<00:01:39.030> people

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
actually under acceleration where people

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.280 
actually under acceleration where people
will<00:01:39.659> shift<00:01:40.079> gear<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.720> let's<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.869> my<00:01:42.990> hand<00:01:43.200> in

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
will shift gear and let's get my hand in

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.749 
will shift gear and let's get my hand in
the<00:01:43.350> right<00:01:43.470> position<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.520> shift

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the right position here they will shift

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
the right position here they will shift
gear<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.130> pushing<00:01:47.759> on

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
gear like this so if you're pushing on

gear like this so if you're pushing on
the<00:01:48.030> throttle<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.590> into<00:01:49.979> the

turn<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> wheel<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.439> times<00:01:58.740> people

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
turn the wheel so a lot of times people

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
turn the wheel so a lot of times people
are<00:01:59.219> changing<00:01:59.640> gear<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.149> aggressively<00:02:00.719> using

cause a tank-slapper
see<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.799> lot<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.640> track<00:02:08.879> where<00:02:09.209> people

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
see it a lot at the track where people

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.420 
see it a lot at the track where people
are<00:02:09.629> changing<00:02:10.200> gear<00:02:10.410> completely<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
wrong technique using this

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.429 
wrong technique using this
another<00:02:14.939> cause<00:02:15.260> yes<00:02:16.260> their<00:02:16.609> army<00:02:17.609> is<00:02:18.439> that

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
another cause yes their army is that

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.920 
another cause yes their army is that
hydraulic<00:02:20.310> settings<00:02:20.790> are<00:02:20.969> wrong<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.450> your

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
hydraulic settings are wrong to your

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.420 
hydraulic settings are wrong to your
compression<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.650> rebound<00:02:22.829> are<00:02:23.250> perhaps

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
compression and rebound are perhaps

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.599 
compression and rebound are perhaps
overlapped<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.930> will<00:02:25.079> give<00:02:25.319> you

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
overlapped and that will give you

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.190 
overlapped and that will give you
exactly<00:02:26.609> the<00:02:26.700> same<00:02:26.849> level<00:02:27.689> of<00:02:27.780> deflection

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
exactly the same level of deflection

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.619 
exactly the same level of deflection
lifting<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> wheel<00:02:29.189> off<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.400> ground<00:02:29.629> turning

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
lifting the wheel off the ground turning

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.569 
lifting the wheel off the ground turning
it<00:02:30.750> slightly<00:02:30.959> at<00:02:31.260> an<00:02:31.319> angle<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.859> that<00:02:32.400> will

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
it slightly at an angle and that will

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.330 
it slightly at an angle and that will
push<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.819> down<00:02:33.530> your<00:02:34.530> other<00:02:34.709> cause<00:02:34.980> because

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
push you down your other cause because

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.879 
push you down your other cause because
you<00:02:35.629> seem<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.930> been<00:02:37.139> on<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.409> street<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
you seem to have been on the street is

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.800 
you seem to have been on the street is
that<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.189> hit<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> severe<00:02:39.090> bump<00:02:39.450> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that you hit a severe bump the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.929 
that you hit a severe bump the
suspension<00:02:40.349> bottomed<00:02:40.739> out<00:02:41.040> completely<00:02:41.730> and

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
suspension bottomed out completely and

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.539 
suspension bottomed out completely and
that<00:02:42.569> caused<00:02:42.840> deflection<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.129> what<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> would

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
that caused deflection so what I would

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.909 
that caused deflection so what I would
do<00:02:44.790> much<00:02:44.970> hello<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.540> see<00:02:46.260> where<00:02:46.409> you're<00:02:46.560> at<00:02:46.680> in

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
do much hello is see where you're at in

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.520 
do much hello is see where you're at in
regards<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.400> say<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:48.000> would<00:02:48.540> also<00:02:48.689> then<00:02:48.900> take<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
regards to say I would also then take a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.890 
regards to say I would also then take a
look<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.609> were<00:02:50.790> physically<00:02:51.389> doing

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
look at what you were physically doing

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.039 
look at what you were physically doing
with<00:02:52.169> the<00:02:52.319> bike<00:02:52.669> sometimes<00:02:53.669> if<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.329> go<00:02:54.599> and

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
with the bike sometimes if you go and

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.990 
with the bike sometimes if you go and
accelerate<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.129> you<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.609> have<00:02:56.819> to

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
accelerate and you think you have to

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.629 
accelerate and you think you have to
accelerate<00:02:57.569> all<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> way<00:02:57.959> there<00:02:58.260> redline<00:02:58.769> you

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
accelerate all the way there redline you

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.110 
accelerate all the way there redline you
quite<00:03:00.090> often<00:03:00.439> go<00:03:01.439> past<00:03:01.799> peak<00:03:02.489> power<00:03:02.790> if<00:03:03.090> you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
quite often go past peak power if you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.259 
quite often go past peak power if you
look<00:03:03.389> at<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.569> power<00:03:03.780> curve<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.650> that

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
look at the power curve and that

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.059 
look at the power curve and that
nosedives<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.510> bike<00:03:06.719> if<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.620> hit<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.889> rev

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
nosedives the bike if you hit the rev

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.280 
nosedives the bike if you hit the rev
limiter<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.669> will<00:03:08.879> nosedive<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.810> bike<00:03:09.989> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
limiter it will nosedive the bike and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.440 
limiter it will nosedive the bike and
suddenly<00:03:11.040> load<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.489> front<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.000> if<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.239> hit<00:03:12.419> a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
suddenly load the front and if you hit a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.420 
suddenly load the front and if you hit a
bump<00:03:12.689> there<00:03:12.959> that<00:03:13.260> tank-slapper<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:14.129> result

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
bump there that tank-slapper can result

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.119 
bump there that tank-slapper can result
from<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.719> so<00:03:15.719> check<00:03:16.109> your<00:03:16.260> sag<00:03:16.500> check<00:03:16.979> your

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
from that so check your sag check your

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.369 
from that so check your sag check your
hydraulics<00:03:17.729> I'm<00:03:18.269> not<00:03:18.629> sure<00:03:18.840> what<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.109> have<00:03:19.260> on

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
hydraulics I'm not sure what you have on

that bike it's been a couple years since
I<00:03:20.970> water<00:03:21.209> one<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:22.440> when<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.650> did<00:03:23.159> work<00:03:23.430> on

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
I water one I know when we did work on

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.640 
I water one I know when we did work on
that<00:03:23.819> particular<00:03:23.970> bike<00:03:24.479> we<00:03:24.780> raised<00:03:25.169> it<00:03:25.440> by

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
that particular bike we raised it by

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.089 
that particular bike we raised it by
almost<00:03:26.220> an<00:03:26.459> inch<00:03:27.349> with<00:03:28.349> a<00:03:28.379> surrogate<00:03:28.650> shock

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
almost an inch with a surrogate shock

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.309 
almost an inch with a surrogate shock
and<00:03:29.400> pushing<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.419> forks<00:03:30.720> all<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.959> way<00:03:31.049> down

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
and pushing the forks all the way down

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.099 
and pushing the forks all the way down
but<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.220> was<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.549> track<00:03:32.790> not<00:03:33.120> street<00:03:33.510> use<00:03:33.840> so

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
but that was for track not street use so

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.409 
but that was for track not street use so
do<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.260> basics<00:03:37.680> first<00:03:37.949> look<00:03:38.879> at<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> your

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
do the basics first look at the your

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.679 
do the basics first look at the your
riding<00:03:39.959> technique<00:03:40.470> are<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.519> too<00:03:41.759> aggressive

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
riding technique are you too aggressive

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:44.809 
riding technique are you too aggressive
did<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.290> head<00:03:43.650> shake<00:03:43.859> start<00:03:44.189> when<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.459> were

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
did the head shake start when you were

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.059 
did the head shake start when you were
accelerating<00:03:45.720> look<00:03:46.530> at<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:46.889> those

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
accelerating look at all those

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.969 
accelerating look at all those
components<00:03:47.909> and<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:48.389> one<00:03:48.599> by<00:03:48.629> one<00:03:48.979> knock

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
components and then one by one knock

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.520 
components and then one by one knock
