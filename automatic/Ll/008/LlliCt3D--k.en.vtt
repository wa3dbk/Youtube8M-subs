00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
introduced to years as a way of tracking

one of the last coins of the Soviet

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.869 
one of the last coins of the Soviet
Union<00:03:36.900> by<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.010> was<00:03:38.159> already<00:03:38.310> comfortable

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
Union by then I was already comfortable

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.629 
Union by then I was already comfortable
with<00:03:39.269> numbers<00:03:39.780> up<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.019> one<00:03:40.409> Google<00:03:40.889> one

followed by 100 zeros but my first

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.509 
followed by 100 zeros but my first
notion<00:03:45.030> when<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.780> learned<00:03:46.139> about<00:03:46.290> years<00:03:46.859> was

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
notion when I learned about years was

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.929 
notion when I learned about years was
that<00:03:47.780> 1991<00:03:48.780> years<00:03:49.139> were<00:03:49.680> all<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.340> had<00:03:50.519> been<00:03:50.699> I

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
that 1991 years were all that had been I

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.990 
that 1991 years were all that had been I
recall<00:03:51.930> being<00:03:52.139> told<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:53.159> my<00:03:53.400> grandfather

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
recall being told that my grandfather

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.809 
recall being told that my grandfather
was<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.359> child<00:03:54.720> during<00:03:55.139> the<00:03:55.229> years<00:03:55.439> 41<00:03:55.949> through

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
was a child during the years 41 through

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.229 
was a child during the years 41 through
45<00:03:57.259> when<00:03:58.259> the<00:03:58.439> Nazis<00:03:58.949> invaded<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.819> Soviet

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
45 when the Nazis invaded the Soviet

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.319 
45 when the Nazis invaded the Soviet
Union<00:04:00.659> and<00:04:00.840> he<00:04:01.349> had<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.680> flee<00:04:01.949> I<00:04:02.189> did<00:04:02.849> not<00:04:03.030> know

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
Union and he had to flee I did not know

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.719 
Union and he had to flee I did not know
that<00:04:03.599> these<00:04:03.780> numbers<00:04:04.290> were<00:04:04.769> abbreviations

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
that these numbers were abbreviations

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:10.580 
that these numbers were abbreviations
for<00:04:06.409> 1941<00:04:07.409> and<00:04:08.299> 1945<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.079> made<00:04:10.439> the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
for 1941 and 1945 so I made the

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.159 
for 1941 and 1945 so I made the
reasonable<00:04:11.129> guess<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:12.239> grandfather<00:04:12.870> was

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
reasonable guess that my grandfather was

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.050 
reasonable guess that my grandfather was
around<00:04:13.500> close<00:04:14.189> to<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.519> beginning<00:04:14.909> of<00:04:15.000> time

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
around close to the beginning of time

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.620 
around close to the beginning of time
but<00:04:15.599> I<00:04:16.349> was<00:04:16.620> also<00:04:16.799> curious<00:04:17.280> about<00:04:18.180> what<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
but I was also curious about what the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.039 
but I was also curious about what the
passage<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.169> time<00:04:19.229> would<00:04:20.159> do<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.579> people<00:04:21.049> once

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
passage of time would do to people once

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.070 
passage of time would do to people once
I<00:04:22.260> asked<00:04:22.680> my<00:04:22.919> mother<00:04:23.190> what<00:04:23.969> happens<00:04:24.510> when

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
I asked my mother what happens when

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.510 
I asked my mother what happens when
people<00:04:25.260> grow<00:04:25.680> up<00:04:25.860> they<00:04:26.700> go<00:04:26.849> to<00:04:26.909> school

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
people grow up they go to school

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.659 
people grow up they go to school

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
she replied and then then they go to

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.140 
she replied and then then they go to
university<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:31.560> then<00:04:32.560> they<00:04:33.490> work<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:34.000> get

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150
