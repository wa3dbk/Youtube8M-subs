shadow that I'm going to deep hot today

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.080 
shadow that I'm going to deep hot today
so<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.070> first<00:01:42.250> thing<00:01:42.430> you're<00:01:42.550> gonna<00:01:42.640> do<00:01:42.910> is

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
so the first thing you're gonna do is

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.230 
so the first thing you're gonna do is
obviously<00:01:43.300> light<00:01:44.110> your<00:01:44.470> candle<00:01:49.770> okay<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
obviously light your candle okay and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320 
obviously light your candle okay and
then<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.009> have<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.190> do<00:01:54.399> is<00:01:54.640> take<00:01:54.940> your<00:01:55.119> eye

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
then all you have to do is take your eye

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.639 
then all you have to do is take your eye
shadow<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:57.610> there's<00:01:57.910> any<00:01:58.300> like<00:01:58.509> plastic<00:01:59.350> like

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
shadow if there's any like plastic like

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.999 
shadow if there's any like plastic like
this<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.190> recommend<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:00.910> take<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.509> out

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
this I recommend that you take it out

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.740 
this I recommend that you take it out
cuz<00:02:03.009> that's<00:02:03.310> just<00:02:03.430> gonna<00:02:03.700> melt<00:02:04.030> burn<00:02:04.509> off

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
cuz that's just gonna melt burn off

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.109 
cuz that's just gonna melt burn off
anyway<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:05.460> might<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:06.550> well<00:02:06.670> take<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.000> off

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
anyway so might as well take it off

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.040 
anyway so might as well take it off
first<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.640> then<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.360> open<00:02:13.750> up<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.020> eye

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
first and then I just open up the eye

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.160 
first and then I just open up the eye
shadow<00:02:14.440> like<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.850> put<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.720> over<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
shadow like so and I put it over the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.310 
shadow like so and I put it over the
flame<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.820> just<00:02:19.030> takes<00:02:19.270> maybe<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.810> few

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
flame and it just takes maybe a few

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.370 
flame and it just takes maybe a few
seconds<00:02:20.799> for<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.760> melt<00:02:21.940> but<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.480> highly

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
seconds for it to melt but I highly

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.920 
seconds for it to melt but I highly
recommend<00:02:23.769> that<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.920> watch<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.930> while

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
recommend that you watch this while

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.020 
recommend that you watch this while
you're<00:02:26.110> doing<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.620> because<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.640> could<00:02:27.820> easily

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you're doing it because it could easily

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.640 
you're doing it because it could easily
catch<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.630> fire<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.650> yeah<00:02:33.690> okay<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:34.750> after<00:02:35.080> a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
catch on fire so yeah okay so after a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.100 
catch on fire so yeah okay so after a
few<00:02:36.310> seconds<00:02:36.760> or<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.269> should<00:02:37.480> look<00:02:37.510> kind<00:02:37.989> of

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
few seconds or so it should look kind of

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.020 
few seconds or so it should look kind of
like<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.970> then<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.760> take<00:02:42.760> your
