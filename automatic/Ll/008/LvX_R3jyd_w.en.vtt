00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
as you can see it's already kind of it

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.359 
as you can see it's already kind of it
works<00:00:17.880> out<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:19.260> I'm<00:00:19.500> currently

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
works out here to it I'm currently

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.210 
works out here to it I'm currently
running<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:21.630> point<00:00:22.020> two<00:00:22.140> point<00:00:22.410> five<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.130> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
running one point two point five but it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.820 
running one point two point five but it
should<00:00:23.430> work<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:24.289> um<00:00:25.289> 2.4<00:00:26.189> 1.2<00:00:26.670> point<00:00:27.119> for

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
should work on um 2.4 1.2 point for

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.030 
should work on um 2.4 1.2 point for
older<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.550> should<00:00:29.730> work<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:30.920> even<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
older I think it should work on even the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.450 
older I think it should work on even the
snapshot<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> 1.3<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> haven't<00:00:34.739> got<00:00:34.950> into

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.830 
snapshot of 1.3 but I haven't got into
