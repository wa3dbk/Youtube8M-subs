00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.110 
you're wondering how long it lasts it
lasts<00:00:43.079> I'd<00:00:43.290> say<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> year<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.940> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
lasts I'd say just over a year so it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.479 
lasts I'd say just over a year so it's
pretty<00:00:45.329> good<00:00:45.480> considering<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.800> paid<00:00:47.280> about

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
pretty good considering I paid about

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
pretty good considering I paid about
fifteen<00:00:48.030> pound<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> time

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
fifteen pound for it and at the time

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.260 
fifteen pound for it and at the time
when<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.309> buying<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.730> it'll<00:00:50.850> last<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.120> bit

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
when you're buying if it'll last a bit

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
when you're buying if it'll last a bit
steep<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.890> spread<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.160> over<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> year

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
steep but if you spread that over a year

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
steep but if you spread that over a year
that's<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.239> cheap<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.899> reptile<00:00:55.520> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that's really cheap for a reptile so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.090 
that's really cheap for a reptile so
won't<00:00:56.850> open<00:00:57.090> left<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.230> thought<00:00:59.039> about

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
won't open left but I have thought about

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
won't open left but I have thought about

obviously it varies from gecko to gecko
but<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.229> figured<00:01:43.860> I'll<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> most

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
but I figured I'll go with the most

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
but I figured I'll go with the most
popular<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.270> everyone<00:01:45.869> suggested<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> me

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
popular one everyone suggested to me

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.210 
popular one everyone suggested to me
just<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.030> quite<00:01:48.240> expensive

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
just because this is quite expensive

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.179 
just because this is quite expensive
this<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.399> was<00:01:50.579> 17<00:01:51.090> pound<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.780> 8<00:01:52.470> ounces<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this one was 17 pound is 8 ounces it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.670 
this one was 17 pound is 8 ounces it
comes<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.930> like<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> wallet<00:01:55.439> thing

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
comes like this and like a wallet thing

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
comes like this and like a wallet thing
but<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> think<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.250> might<00:01:56.549> end<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:57.030> tipping<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
but I think I might end up tipping it in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.969 
but I think I might end up tipping it in
to<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> repair<00:01:58.350> she<00:01:58.530> won<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:58.860> I'm

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to the repair she won when I'm

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.319
