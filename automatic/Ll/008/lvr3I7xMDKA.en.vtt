00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.160
 Güey proteins 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.240
 routine is way the protein comes from the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.210
 milk 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:47.120
 the milk contains something 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.070
 and does not miss the lactose act 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.690
 lactose is a warm day two molecules 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.430
 of glucose 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 of milk 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.840
 and it's generally different from 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.760
 difficult absorption because with age 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.410
 we lose the lactase which is the enzyme 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.110
 able to digest lactose is also a 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.760
 simple sugar with which it induces peaks 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.050
 of insulin that do not interest us for 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.500
 nothing when as I will explain now to 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.970
 continuation 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.740
 that interests us from milk to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.140
 protein that's why when we talk about 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.700
 Weiss is talking about whey protein and the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.200
 soil garment is protein that does not 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.380
 contains 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.969
 lactose unfortunately logically to be 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.159
 some expensive processes and the result is 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.979
 an expensive protein many brands are 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.299
 They are in charge of selling us dewey protein that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.039
 it is usually a can for the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.720
 act albumin treated micro filtered 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.850
 hydrolyzed financing and micro filtered 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.470
 but not ion exchange and I the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.030
 protein that I would recommend for people 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.530
 who wants to take it seriously wants 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.729
 take a good supplement that is spent 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.860
 some money but that really is 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.560
 effective if I would not tell you eat and not 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.509
 you buy protein right away, although there 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.240
 some micro filtered with exchange 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.709
 ionic they are also fine not all 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.920
 you have to despise the but above all 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.080
 look at the components 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.460
 what I recommend for the purist 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.420
 ion exchange proteins 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.039
 treated protein with a process 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.690
 very expensive machines to make the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.900
 electric shocks in the protein that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.180
 what they do is separate the lactose 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.799
 of milk protein because it goes 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.079
 totally landing is very difficult 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.269
 separate the and that makes the protein 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.870
 obtained is practically 0.8 of 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.879
 lactose are trace 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.930
 perfect because it does not produce peaks of 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.569
 insulin and perfect because over 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.950
 respect the amount I was born branched 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.460
 which contains the protein chain of the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.030
 current unit 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.190
 that is to say 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.860
 and only at the end hallucinates evaluate now 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.510
 let's say they are the amino acids 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.400
 branched to know what they are in 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.340
 actually branched first you have to be 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 which are the essential amino acids 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.680
 we enzymatically mind level 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.440
 cellular we are able to manufacture 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 any amino acid are already known 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.319
 of 270 and they say that in the future we can 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.880
 get to the thousand and something some 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.760
 substances or micronutrients like 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.380
 vitamins have been now 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.940
 contemplated as amino acids say 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.890
 it has even been discovered that some of 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.350
 the things that we had as vitamins 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 they are amino acids and they are destroying 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.380
 constantly amino acid amino acids 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.110
 the basis of life the basis of the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.390
 formation of an organic being 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.290
 where there are amino acids there is possibility of 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.290
 life or there has been life 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.320
 an essential amino acid is that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.450
 amino acid amino acids that we do not 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.209
 we can 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.610
 ingest through food we can not 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.780
 synthesize is to say everything that all 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.770
 the amino acids that we who are 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.630
 able to manufacture enzymatically mind are 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.580
 to my essential nation the eight that 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.810
 we have eight there that we do not 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.959
 We have the ability to manufacture 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.700
 those eight essential amino acids the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.300
 we must eat food 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.890
 but what food that contains protein 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.430
 contains those eight amino acids 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.980
 essential the meat protein the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.480
 ovalbumin egg protein 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.269
 milk protein 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.440
 protein but not the plant 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.290
 patina of the vegetables only contains 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.060
 six of the eight essential amino acids 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.109
 that we need therefore that 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.650
 incomplete protein that in the long run 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.690
 could cause problems 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.840
 problems as soon as 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.889
 skin digestion could even make 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.689
 appear some disease 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.729
 the protein or amino acids 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.249
 essential are those that we can not 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.009
 manufacture enzymatically mind and those 8 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.139
 we have 3 that are the branched ones that 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:41.080
 they are and hallucinates lucina from balín to that 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.900
 are the three first 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.320
 intervene 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.460
 in the reconstruction of the fibers of the 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.050
 to eat of the moons like 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.979
 explained before and they do cement 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.979
 for the muscle
