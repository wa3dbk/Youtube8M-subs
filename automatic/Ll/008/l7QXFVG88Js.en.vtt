this<00:00:35.250> street<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.149> wasn't<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:36.690> my

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
this street and it wasn't actually my

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
this street and it wasn't actually my
fault<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.670> i<00:00:38.700> can't<00:00:39.090> record

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390

live<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.860> been<00:00:41.100> having<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.610> rely<00:00:41.790> on

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
live so I have been having to rely on

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.229 
live so I have been having to rely on
Infinity<00:00:42.690> Ward's<00:00:42.989> theater<00:00:43.379> mode<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> ps3

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
Infinity Ward's theater mode on the ps3

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.049 
Infinity Ward's theater mode on the ps3
which<00:00:45.239> unfortunately<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.500> reliable

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
which unfortunately is not that reliable

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
which unfortunately is not that reliable
also<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.809> aim<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.260> that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
also as you can see my aim is not that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.290 
also as you can see my aim is not that
reliable<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.430> keep<00:00:50.610> trying<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> shoot

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
reliable as I keep trying to shoot

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
reliable as I keep trying to shoot
through<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> solid<00:00:51.750> object<00:00:52.190> but<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.489> ok<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
through a solid object but that's ok we

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
through a solid object but that's ok we
all<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> moments<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
all have moments like that and I think I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.740 
all have moments like that and I think I
redeem<00:00:56.399> myself<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.000> minute<00:00:57.210> by<00:00:57.329> finishing

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750
