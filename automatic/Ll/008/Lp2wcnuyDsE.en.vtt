00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.459
 hello to all fans to install 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.709
 to your magic lantern and anyone 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.900
 afraid to install on your fotik even 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.449
 official firmware for fear that their fotik 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.039
 will break and the guarantee will be 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.009
 void well and all such a spirit 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.109
 Today we will talk about the camera canon 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.199
 eos 650d 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.579
 and how to install magic tape on it 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.560
 I recommend first 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.720
 format the USB flash drive 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.440
 after which remove it and insert it into 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.780
 card reader 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.150
 in no case connect to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.710
 Connect the camera through the cable 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.640
 through the card reader 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.990
 Download the archive by the link below the video. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.070
 we unpack it from unpacked 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:55.820
 archive dump dumpier to the root of the folder 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.750
 memory cards extract memory cards 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.210
 insert camera go menu 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.720
 choose version by install later 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.140
 we format the memory card we retrieve from 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.520
 camera insert into the card reader 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.310
 we will unpack magic land it in a card root 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.440
 memory card is now necessary to do 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.680
 boot open for this 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.380
 and Oscar we put two checkmarks press cf 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.600
 we go out once again we check 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.820
 ticks in place if they are in place then 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.220
 everything turned out well then 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.420
 we pull out from the card reader a memory card 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.760
 insert the camera and enjoy more 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.580
 In this archive there is crop Marx and you 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.750
 can set yourself add add 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.510
 delete do whatever you want with them 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.170
 also this firmware is recording in video 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.360
 This is the alpha version, it is still unfinished. 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.799
 new magic lantern is working hard on 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.140
 this and we hope that the near future we 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.229
 we can shoot on our cameras ru 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.030
 video in very good quality true i 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.130
 I think that for this you will need to have 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.800
 good enough flash drives 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.170
 well that's not a problem 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.590
 if we have any questions write 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.820
 ask if possible answer it all 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.580
 what i wanted to show 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.120
 I hope this video has helped someone 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.120
