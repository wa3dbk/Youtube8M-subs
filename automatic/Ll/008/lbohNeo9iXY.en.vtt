00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to all as we can appreciate 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.410
 we have the beretta the famous beretta 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.620
 92fs model 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.879
 This weapon is regulatory for 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.879
 military in usa 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.260
 this is the improved version of the of the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.710
 beretta model 92 efe 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.090
 and let's show what the difference is 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.700
 in which we will first review the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.290
 argument I'm downloaded for that 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.680
 we present the button that holds the 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.680
 slide 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 and we have here the cacerina that has a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.620
 capacity of 15 shots at this time 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.620
 your maximum limit is charged 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 we check that the increase is downloaded 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.100
 to start 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.750
 we see this little piece that should be here 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.200
 show a red dot if there is a bullet in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.200
 bed 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.320
 let's review 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.510
 we have insurance to my right hand we are going to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.920
 to appreciate 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.480
 from both sides 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.000
 yes insurance with insurance 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.070
 let's throw the slide but with 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.610
 sure to get a bullet in the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.810
 bedroom as we will appreciate 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 there is no bedroom fence 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 this beretta 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.180
 has insurance in the slide 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.740
 we also have the needle insurance 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.640
 next percussion is this little 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.640
 rectangular piece 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.290
 We can to precise piece when the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.810
 weapon with insurance 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.260
 we see what 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.530
 this piece stands out 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.060
 because if the weapon is loaded the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.910
 hammer is backward once 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.580
 fully depressed the trigger goes up 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.350
 that piece leaves the hammer blade free 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.350
 to which the shot 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.080
 we have the weapon that is unloaded 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.450
 Until now 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.450
 once 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.450
 stay everything we will be insecure 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:24.340
 we assume that there is a bullet in the chamber 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.360
 once the trigger is pressed 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.360
 the same impulse 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.760
 when hitting this little piece that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.069
 we can see round 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.989
 is the one that hits directly with the 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.860
 percussive needle when you press the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.670
 trigger 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.670
 this piece stands out 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.230
 in the blow of an announcer 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.620
 with what it is in case of ammunition 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.680
 that same impulse 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.900
 that has the ammunition 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.300
 expels a gas which 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.820
 makes the bullet 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.010
 saves with a great power in which 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.900
 that gas 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.989
 completely fills the slide 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.049
 and makes the race again come back 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.879
 back and bring it back again 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.939
 another ammunition this is a gun 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.670
 semiautomatic in which once thrown 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.400
 the slide 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 a shot is fired halfway the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.000
 sliding back to back 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.110
 automatically and it takes to work the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.400
 bedroom 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.630
 and when the last ammo is fired 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.800
 a belt 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.800
 it stays this way 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.250
 to dismantle this moment 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.910
 we throw the hammer backwards as 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.290
 let's appreciate without insurance because 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.170
 we are aware that there is no 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.140
 a bullet from the camera we press this 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.540
 small piece here and this piece here 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:07.760
 we have it pressed in this way 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:11.079
 and we lower the lever and remove what 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.079
 we have here the hilt 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.150
 the recoil spring 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.840
 and then we created what is the canyon 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.130
 what we have here is the canyon 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.320
 we have I do not think you can notice anything 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.200
 in the video that we have within the year 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.569
 in the form of the city that that allows 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:44.399
 that the bullet comes out with more power 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.399
 because this time long-barreled 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.240
 for more again this time we have 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.919
 the slide 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.340
 we can appreciate that here we have the 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.340
 piercing needle 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.150
 again we put the cannon 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.020
 is fixed in this way the spring of 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.020
 recoil 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.870
 is fixed 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.320
 and we put this way 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.780
 let's say the strap back and we go up 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:21.449
 this piece up 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.229
 and we put your site back 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.229
 Secure the slide 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.270
 and we have the path 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.710
 the mind 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.710
 we put the cacerina 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.650
 is with insurance 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.250
 this beta has 15 shots capacity 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.400
 can take a vision to the real camera 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:50.520
 It is advisable to never carry a bullet 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.590
 bedroom never 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.319
 because too many 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.220
 accidents and that one can sometimes 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.220
 forget 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:07.570
 we remove the insurance that is ambidextrous 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.120
 the small rectangular piece that the 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.520
 emission at the start traca protrudes a 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.360
 red dot does not stand out because it does not 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.569
 there is no going of the bed 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.699
 if we say we can appreciate that the 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:22.340
 correct backwards when jumping the fence 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.730
 a real camera 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.490
 now shows the piece red or red 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.590
 there is a guarantee of the camera 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.650
 to remove that ammunition 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.529
 we press the button that we have here in 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.209
 the hard wedge that retains the cacerina 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.790
 As you can see it does not have the capacity 

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:44.680
 15 shots combed the camera here 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:48.400
 shows the red and ninth point of the 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.750
 camera an expression to the trigger comes out a 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.560
 pull 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.590
 what do we do 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.540
 we put the slide lock that 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.060
 hide this little piece as we can 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.350
 appreciate that it rises and hide it 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.080
 to hit match directly this 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.629
 piece 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.629
 and no shot should come out 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:16.430
 we still have a bullet in the chamber for 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:20.210
 withdrawing it is simply with insurance and 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.210
 we removed what the ammunition 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.900
 as they can under pressure 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.900
 I have a 9 mm ammunition s 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.040
 and again there is no bullet in the 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.040
 bedroom 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.590
 to lose the cacerina we press 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.480
 this way 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.350
 down 

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.350
 and back 

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.330
 Normally colo like cans wound with 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.330
 safe 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:08:00.930
 and we have 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.930
 the beretta 92 fs that's all thanks
