great Glide I put it up a kid to

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.210 
great Glide I put it up a kid to
Dominator<00:04:54.060> in<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.240> heartbeat<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:55.070> it's<00:04:56.070> got

great stability same maneuverability

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.010 
great stability same maneuverability
that<00:04:58.320> we<00:04:58.470> saw<00:04:58.620> in<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.770> 12<00:04:59.100> 6<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.690> think<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:00.900> kind

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
that we saw in that 12 6 I think we kind

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.750 
that we saw in that 12 6 I think we kind
of<00:05:01.139> feel<00:05:01.289> that<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.470> fin<00:05:01.680> might<00:05:01.889> be<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.039> bit

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
of feel that the fin might be a bit

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.790 
of feel that the fin might be a bit
small<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.690> think<00:05:03.840> depending<00:05:04.139> upon<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.530> size

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
small so I think depending upon the size

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.770 
small so I think depending upon the size
of<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.010> paddler<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:06.330> might<00:05:06.450> actually<00:05:06.600> want

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
of the paddler you might actually want

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.940 
of the paddler you might actually want
to<00:05:06.900> upgrade<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.380> little<00:05:07.560> bit<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.770> bigger

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
to upgrade to a little bit of a bigger

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.370 
to upgrade to a little bit of a bigger
fin<00:05:08.190> but<00:05:08.690> but<00:05:09.690> all<00:05:09.840> in<00:05:09.960> all<00:05:10.020> it's<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.260> great

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
fin but but all in all it's a great
