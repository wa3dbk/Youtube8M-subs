00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
what's our YouTube how you're doing this

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.710 
what's our YouTube how you're doing this
is<00:00:01.709> mr.<00:00:01.979> toy<00:00:02.129> box<00:00:02.370> one<00:00:02.550> two<00:00:02.760> three<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.600> this

flash storage test on the retina MacBook
Pro<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.670> guys<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.510> actually

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
Pro so here we go guys I'm actually

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.509 
Pro so here we go guys I'm actually
running<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.199> ScreenFlow<00:00:25.920> session<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
running a ScreenFlow session at the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460 
running a ScreenFlow session at the
moment<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.000> haven't<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.630> done<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.320> when

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
moment I haven't actually done that when

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.500 
moment I haven't actually done that when
I've<00:00:28.590> been<00:00:28.769> doing<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> Geekbench<00:00:29.369> tests<00:00:30.179> or

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I've been doing the Geekbench tests or

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.030 
I've been doing the Geekbench tests or
any<00:00:30.810> other<00:00:30.990> kind<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.380> performance<00:00:31.769> test

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
any other kind of performance test

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.200 
any other kind of performance test
because<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> does<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:32.700> slow<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
because it does actually slow the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
because it does actually slow the
Machine<00:00:33.600> down<00:00:33.809> quite<00:00:34.500> considerably<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.190> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
Machine down quite considerably and you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670 
Machine down quite considerably and you
don't<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.910> true<00:00:36.329> result<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.500> this

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
don't get a true result but with this

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440 
don't get a true result but with this
one<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.309> disc<00:00:38.520> only<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.090> shouldn't

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one because it's disc only we shouldn't

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.600 
one because it's disc only we shouldn't
really<00:00:39.660> be<00:00:39.809> impacting<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> great<00:00:40.890> deal<00:00:41.129> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
really be impacting that a great deal so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.479 
really be impacting that a great deal so
let's<00:00:42.030> run<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.719> black<00:00:43.170> magic<00:00:43.710> speed<00:00:44.129> test

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
let's run up the black magic speed test

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
let's run up the black magic speed test
and<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> speeds<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.230> get

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and just see what kind of speeds we get

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.950 
and just see what kind of speeds we get
through<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.399> flash<00:00:47.730> storage<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.450> retina

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
reading just a second and i would expect

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
reading just a second and i would expect
that<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.509> coming<00:01:15.930> close<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> 450<00:01:16.799> 4<00:01:17.280> 30<00:01:17.610> this

that to be coming close to 450 4 30 this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.380 
that to be coming close to 450 4 30 this

now<00:01:28.950> let's<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> look<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
now let's just have a look at the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.350 
now let's just have a look at the
specifications<00:01:31.430> in<00:01:32.430> fact<00:01:32.670> more<00:01:32.820> importantly

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
specifications in fact more importantly

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260 
specifications in fact more importantly
let's<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.640> SSD

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
let's see if we can see what kind of SSD

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.749 
let's see if we can see what kind of SSD
or<00:01:36.420> flash<00:01:36.659> storage<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.229> particular<00:01:37.759> laptop
