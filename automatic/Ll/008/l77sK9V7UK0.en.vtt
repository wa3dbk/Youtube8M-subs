00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.980
 Eskimos 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.040
 is doing a lot but a lot of heat 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.240
 indicates why we do not make a recipe 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.540
 refreshing so you can put your 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.890
 freezer and shops 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.500
 to make this recipe is super simple 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.170
 you only need about two cream houses 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.900
 to beat an egg a little bit of sugar 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.040
 and also exact vanilla and I already 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.170
 first thing you have to do is grab 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.989
 egg 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.040
 and it's not when we're going to beat very well not 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 we're going to put half a cup of sugar 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.390
 we mix it very well a cup of milk 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.180
 and I'm using almond milk 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.350
 two cups of cream to beat down here 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.600
 I'm going to leave all the amounts 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 exact so they do not get confused and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.480
 also our vanilla extract one 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.670
 spoonful you mix it very well like that 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.680
 and we're going to pass it a stove until 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.570
 start to boil and then we 're going to 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.880
 strain in something that is provided to us and 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.280
 fill our pallet molds no 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800
 you have palette molds do not worry 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.620
 you can use typed you should only these 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.600
 pretty tequileros and we're going to put the 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.220
 mix in here not up and 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.780
 then it was a piece of paper 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.930
 aluminum and we cut it here with a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.850
 knife and we're going to get into the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.740
 freezer for about 6 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.660
 hours since our pallets are 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.360
 frozen we are going to put them in water 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.230
