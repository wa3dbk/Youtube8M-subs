00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
it's absolutely worthless because all

settings here I mean it's just your
basics<00:00:49.340> in<00:00:50.340> terms<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.079> you<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.260> could

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
basics in terms of you know you could

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.850 
basics in terms of you know you could
change<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.140> backgrounds<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
change some of the the backgrounds and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.590 
change some of the the backgrounds and
looks<00:00:56.129> blue<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:58.820> kind<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.390> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
looks blue or kind of like this one so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.970 
looks blue or kind of like this one so
I'll<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.840> leave<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> visualize<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
I'll just leave it the visualize are

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.359 
I'll just leave it the visualize are
yelling<00:01:02.250> at<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.520> choices<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.120> visualizer

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
yelling at two choices for visualizer

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.440 
yelling at two choices for visualizer
day/night<00:01:05.369> mode<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> gives<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> option

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
day/night mode it gives you the option

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
day/night mode it gives you the option
of<00:01:06.540> locking<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.260> always<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.250> always

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
of locking it in always they are always

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
of locking it in always they are always
night<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.939> keep<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.450> Auto<00:01:11.600> I'll<00:01:12.600> just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
night I just keep it in Auto I'll just

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.980 
night I just keep it in Auto I'll just
to<00:01:12.900> show<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.350> difference<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.689> let's<00:01:15.689> go

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to show you the difference here let's go

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.719 
to show you the difference here let's go
to<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.340> navigation<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.509> lights<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
to the navigation so my lights are on I

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.690 
to the navigation so my lights are on I
turn<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.850> lights<00:01:21.060> off<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.430> it'll<00:01:23.430> brighten

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
turn my lights off and it'll brighten

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.539 
turn my lights off and it'll brighten
and<00:01:24.170> then<00:01:25.170> there's<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.530> sensors<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.340> there

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and then there's also sensors in there

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.240 
and then there's also sensors in there
as<00:01:26.700> well<00:01:27.890> let's<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.860> that's<00:01:31.860> really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
as well let's go back and that's really

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.800 
as well let's go back and that's really
bright<00:01:32.460> because<00:01:33.030> that's<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.689> does

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.510 

back<00:01:41.810> into<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.229> settings<00:01:42.500> one<00:01:42.800> more<00:01:42.979> time

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
if you need it I think someone already

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.620 
if you need it I think someone already
showed<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.310> on<00:02:32.459> another<00:02:32.700> Sony<00:02:33.060> device<00:02:33.420> but

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
showed this on another Sony device but

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.240 
showed this on another Sony device but
you<00:02:33.660> could<00:02:33.810> actually<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.739> know<00:02:34.770> pick<00:02:35.069> your

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
you could actually you know pick your

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.300 
you could actually you know pick your
listening<00:02:35.760> position<00:02:36.209> which<00:02:36.390> does<00:02:36.690> change<00:02:37.310> how

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
listening position which does change how

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.770 
listening position which does change how
the<00:02:38.370> sound<00:02:38.730> presents<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.480> which<00:02:39.630> is

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
the sound presents to you which is

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.350 
the sound presents to you which is
pretty<00:02:39.959> cool<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.470> like<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.950> way<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.239> make

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
pretty cool I like the way you can make

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.809

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.490 

balance<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.030> fader<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.660> mean<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.050> can

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
balance and fader I mean you just can

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.080 
balance and fader I mean you just can
adjust<00:02:55.920> it<00:03:00.830> then<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.100> adjust<00:03:02.190> some<00:03:02.940> of

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
adjust it then you can adjust some of

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.020 
adjust it then you can adjust some of
these<00:03:03.180> things<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.660> well<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:08.250> that's<00:03:08.340> that's

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
these things as well and that's that's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.840 
these things as well and that's that's
pretty<00:03:09.239> much<00:03:09.480> it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.490 

backup<00:03:12.660> camera<00:03:14.540> comes<00:03:15.540> right<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:18.380> let's<00:03:19.380> out

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.790 

I<00:03:27.480> guess<00:03:28.480> sometimes<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.080> gets<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.290> little<00:03:29.320> goofy

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
I guess sometimes it gets a little goofy

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.260 
I guess sometimes it gets a little goofy
but<00:03:29.830> that<00:03:30.160> was<00:03:30.330> that's<00:03:31.330> first<00:03:33.120> there<00:03:34.120> we<00:03:34.300> go

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270
