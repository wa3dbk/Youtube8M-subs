00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.750
 Hello dear viewer in touch 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.619
 superheroica today we will tell you about 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.890
 transformers 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.840
 and no about these here they are generally like you 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.490
 think what would be if transformers 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.890
 met with and the avengers 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.890
 comics crossover narrates about this 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.590
 new avengers transformer or new 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.879
 Avengers and Transformers 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.250
 briefly about the plot new avengers 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.530
 sent to Latvia territory 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.269
 guided by a doctor in order to 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.199
 to investigate a string of shelling on 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.780
 neighboring country 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.280
 sim korea there they find a strange sphere 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.040
 unknown technologies 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.110
 this sphere radiates waves of aggression heroes 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.379
 should neutralize this area otherwise 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.659
 the war begins and stands behind all this 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.640
 very megatron itself on this ground 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.640
 two teams of defenders of our mortal 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.390
 the earth is forced to unite now a little 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.610
 more 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.470
 idea and really good meeting of two 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.770
 teams of defenders of their worlds 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.110
 man and car but the supply is damp 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.570
 sometimes everything just merges and is not clear 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.950
 what is happening here because of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.969
 this all looks pretty 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.000
 clichÃ©d 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:23.539
 dialogues Makhach abduction dialogues 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.289
 uniting thunder dialogues betrayal 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.689
 the dialogues 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.270
 betrayal again and finally the battle with 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.710
 the boss in this case with megatron we 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.689
 like watching another movie 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.590
 transformer where people are represented as 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.090
 the weakest 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.009
 so in the comic, people with 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.469
 super powers get double 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.140
 a portion of the blows looks especially ridiculous 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.329
 then how two universes of comics try 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.369
 somehow touch for example words 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.590
 iron man about what he already 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.840
 has been following the news for a long time 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.240
 robots therefore created a huge suit 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.490
 for battle with them now about heroes in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.999
 team of avengers present wolverine 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.999
 captain america hatch cage spiderman 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:02.630

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.420
 moon bolt run amok

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.849

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.890
 kill the script completely come off quite 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.170
 suitable for collision avenger with 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.150
 living machines drawing fits 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.640
 crossover style can not be said about 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.250
