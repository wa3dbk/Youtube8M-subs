vanity is going to be painted white so

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.630 
vanity is going to be painted white so
I'm<00:00:30.539> using<00:00:30.779> popular<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.560> poplar<00:00:32.489> has<00:00:32.579> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I'm using popular because poplar has a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
I'm using popular because poplar has a
very<00:00:32.940> nice<00:00:33.149> tight<00:00:33.540> grain<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
very nice tight grain it's in the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.709 
very nice tight grain it's in the
hardwood<00:00:35.309> family<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.300> real<00:00:36.540> hard

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
hardwood family but it's not real hard

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.350 
hardwood family but it's not real hard
so<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.079> very<00:00:37.200> easy<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.649> work<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.430> holds

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
so it's very easy to work with it holds

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.119 
so it's very easy to work with it holds
a<00:00:39.450> screw<00:00:39.750> well<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.530> easy<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> nail

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
a screw well and it's easy to nail

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.430 
a screw well and it's easy to nail
through<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> nail<00:00:42.180> gun<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:43.050> I've<00:00:43.230> also

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
through with a nail gun now I've also

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
through with a nail gun now I've also
bought<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.309> material<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> wood

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
bought the material or the wood

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.380 
bought the material or the wood
described<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.590> s4s<00:00:47.489> which<00:00:47.879> stands<00:00:48.210> for

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
described as s4s which stands for

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.779 
described as s4s which stands for
surfaced<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> four<00:00:49.469> sides<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
surfaced on four sides and I do that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
surfaced on four sides and I do that
because<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.270> saves<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> lot<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> time

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
because it just saves me a lot of time

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.040 
because it just saves me a lot of time

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
board

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.260 
board
whoops<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> board<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.969> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
whoops this is one of the board and this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.189 
whoops this is one of the board and this
is<00:01:00.420> described<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.710> 1<00:01:02.699> by<00:01:02.910> 6<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.629> means<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is described as a 1 by 6 which means it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
is described as a 1 by 6 which means it
measures<00:01:04.830> three<00:01:05.189> quarters<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:05.700> inch<00:01:05.820> by

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
measures three quarters of an inch by

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.080 
measures three quarters of an inch by
five<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.229> half<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.850> these<00:01:09.030> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
five and a half and you can get these in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
five and a half and you can get these in
many<00:01:09.990> different<00:01:10.200> lanes<00:01:10.560> usually<00:01:11.070> starting<00:01:11.490> at

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
many different lanes usually starting at

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.149 
many different lanes usually starting at
8<00:01:11.850> feet<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.869> 16<00:01:13.409> feet<00:01:13.710> I'll

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
8 feet going all the way to 16 feet I'll

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
8 feet going all the way to 16 feet I'll
use<00:01:14.430> 3/4<00:01:14.939> inch<00:01:15.090> birch<00:01:15.270> plywood<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
use 3/4 inch birch plywood for the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
use 3/4 inch birch plywood for the
bottom<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> cabinet<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> sides<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
bottom of the cabinet and the sides and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
bottom of the cabinet and the sides and
the<00:01:18.119> reason<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.780> birch<00:01:19.170> plywood

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the reason for that is birch plywood

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.469 
the reason for that is birch plywood
paints<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.430> nicely<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> nice<00:01:21.210> tight

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
paints really nicely has a nice tight

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
paints really nicely has a nice tight
green<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.530> takes<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.220> nice<00:01:23.430> clear

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
green but it also takes a nice clear

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.999 
green but it also takes a nice clear
finish<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> outside<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.560> painted

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
finish so the outside will be painted

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.160 
finish so the outside will be painted
and<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> whole<00:01:26.580> inside<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> cabinet<00:01:27.750> will

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and the whole inside of the cabinet will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
and the whole inside of the cabinet will
be<00:01:28.320> clear<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> clear<00:01:30.090> finish<00:01:30.360> on

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
be clear and I like a clear finish on

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
be clear and I like a clear finish on
the<00:01:30.750> inside<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> cabinet<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the inside of the cabinet because it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.390 
the inside of the cabinet because it
just<00:01:32.850> stays<00:01:33.450> cleaner<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.290> doesn't<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
just stays cleaner it doesn't get the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
just stays cleaner it doesn't get the
scuff<00:01:35.700> marks<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.420> might<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
scuff marks that you might get on a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.230 
scuff marks that you might get on a
painted<00:01:38.250> finish<00:01:38.430> especially<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.090> you're

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
painted finish especially if you're

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
not have a straight edge so you're going

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.890 
not have a straight edge so you're going

you<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.739> use<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> circular<00:02:37.220> saw<00:02:37.459> with<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> sled

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
you can use a circular saw with a sled

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.660 
you can use a circular saw with a sled
and<00:02:38.510> cut<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> straight<00:02:39.590> line<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.280> then<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.489> can

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
and cut a straight line and then you can

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.330 
and cut a straight line and then you can
run<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.030> through<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.420> table<00:02:41.840> saw<00:02:42.250> there's<00:02:43.250> a

run it through the table saw there's a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.830 
run it through the table saw there's a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.110 
your lumber now this board looks really
pretty<00:03:14.329> good<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:14.870> whenever<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:15.880> pick<00:03:16.880> my

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
pretty good and whenever I pick my

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360 
pretty good and whenever I pick my
