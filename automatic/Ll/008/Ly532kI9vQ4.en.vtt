00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.119
 pot and cauliflower itself for 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.880

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.029
 milliliters 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.029
 put the cabbage in a glass pot 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.070
 pour water 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.260

 pediatrician 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.420
 recent years prove that the introduction 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 fruit juices pureed baby procyon 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.759
 practically does not affect 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.680
 food fortification they are only two 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.200
 percent provide body crumbs 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.390
 vitamin and may also have 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.509
 irritating effect on the intestines and 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.909
 cause bloating teaching abdominal pain and 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.450

 give shock we began to appear constipated 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.039
 therefore, begin the introduction of complementary foods 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.590
 will turn out important mashed potatoes especially if 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.340

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 redness and flaking it still 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.660
 limbs buttocks my daughter was born 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.960
 premature or growing rapidly 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.740
 it is better to start with mashed potatoes of one type 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.110
 vegetables 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.030
 this avoids food allergies 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.970
 which may appear at 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.420
 using mashed vegetables 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.660
 and if allergies in the face it will be easier 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.090
 recognize which product caused it 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.970
 help offer first choose yourself 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.700
 zucchini cauliflower broccoli I 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.819
 I take out the points I preferred the chicken empty and 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 so mashing starts with 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.170
 pick cauliflower 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.360
 the vegetable must be of high quality and fresh 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.760
 what can be seen carefully studying 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.400

 also dense for making mashed potatoes 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.129
 for a child is best to take cabbage and 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.920

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.590
 cabbage buds with dark like not like 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.680
 inflorescences and seniors do not stand 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.209
 since most likely he is 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.489
