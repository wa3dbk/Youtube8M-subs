last year I believe was a 1970 charger
so<00:01:21.159> I<00:01:21.579> mean<00:01:21.789> if<00:01:21.880> he<00:01:21.999> went<00:01:22.210> one<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:22.840> think<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
so I mean if he went one I think that a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.649 
so I mean if he went one I think that a
lot<00:01:23.740> of<00:01:23.829> it<00:01:23.920> comes<00:01:24.039> down<00:01:24.249> to<00:01:24.310> driver<00:01:25.240> skill<00:01:25.569> and

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
lot of it comes down to driver skill and

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.929

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.440 
weeks ago
I<00:01:43.299> do<00:01:43.899> notice<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.469> engine<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:44.950> standard

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I do notice to the engine the standard

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.359 
I do notice to the engine the standard
5.7<00:01:46.450> liter<00:01:46.600> plastic<00:01:46.840> intake<00:01:47.499> manifold<00:01:47.979> has

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
5.7 liter plastic intake manifold has

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.399 
5.7 liter plastic intake manifold has
been<00:01:48.579> replaced<00:01:48.789> with<00:01:49.029> a<00:01:49.149> 6.1<00:01:49.689> aluminum

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
been replaced with a 6.1 aluminum

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.519 
been replaced with a 6.1 aluminum
manifold<00:01:51.069> big<00:01:51.670> change<00:01:51.939> in<00:01:52.090> power<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.600> would

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:53.529 
manifold big change in power I would

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.129 
manifold big change in power I would
think<00:01:53.920> it's<00:01:54.459> more<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.759> for<00:01:55.270> for<00:01:55.749> air<00:01:55.899> and

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
think it's more so for for air and

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.359 
think it's more so for for air and
induction<00:01:56.529> but<00:01:56.770> there's<00:01:56.889> definitely<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.219> power

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
induction but there's definitely a power

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.489 
induction but there's definitely a power
increase<00:01:57.789> you<00:01:57.939> can<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.179> can<00:01:58.329> feel<00:01:58.569> it<00:01:58.749> and<00:01:58.869> one

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
increase you can you can feel it and one

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:00.480 
increase you can you can feel it and one
of<00:01:59.529> the<00:01:59.619> reasons<00:01:59.799> I<00:01:59.889> did<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.130> too<00:02:00.249> is<00:02:00.340> it

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
of the reasons I did it too is it

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.999 
of the reasons I did it too is it
aesthetic<00:02:00.909> mods<00:02:01.329> I<00:02:01.689> just<00:02:02.200> not<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:02.469> huge<00:02:02.709> fan<00:02:02.979> of

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
aesthetic mods I just not a huge fan of

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.620 
aesthetic mods I just not a huge fan of
the<00:02:03.249> plastic<00:02:03.639> look<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:03.909> like<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.149> nice

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the plastic look I like the nice

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.209 
the plastic look I like the nice
aluminum<00:02:04.990> look<00:02:05.319> you<00:02:05.499> know<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.770> be<00:02:05.829> ported

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
aluminum look you know it can be ported

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.410 
aluminum look you know it can be ported
it<00:02:06.340> can<00:02:06.429> be<00:02:06.490> polished<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:06.999> I<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.209> think<00:02:07.270> it

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
it can be polished and I just think it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.419 
it can be polished and I just think it
gives<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.020> car<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> better<00:02:08.380> look<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.250> great

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
gives the car a better look it's a great

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.190 
gives the car a better look it's a great
piece<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.670> barrel<00:02:10.209> ram<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:10.690> call<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:11.050> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
piece the barrel ram they call that the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.530 
piece the barrel ram they call that the
6.1<00:02:11.830> liter<00:02:11.860> engine<00:02:12.430> piece<00:02:12.580> well<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.480> to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540
