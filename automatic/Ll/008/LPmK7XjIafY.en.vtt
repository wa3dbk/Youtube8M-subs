00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that they can attack on the downhills as

that they can attack on the downhills as
well<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> climbs<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> flats<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:35.149> think

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
well as the climbs and flats I think

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.610 
well as the climbs and flats I think
it's<00:00:36.390> getting<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.110> important

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it's getting more and more important

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
it's getting more and more important
we've<00:00:37.739> seen<00:00:38.010> during<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> last<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:38.940> say

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
we've seen during the last I would say

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.260 
we've seen during the last I would say
five<00:00:39.690> or<00:00:39.719> six<00:00:40.170> seasons<00:00:40.700> there's<00:00:41.700> there<00:00:42.180> are

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
five or six seasons there's there are

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
five or six seasons there's there are
more<00:00:42.510> guys<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.750> quick<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> hill<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
more guys that quick down the hill and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.889 
more guys that quick down the hill and
they<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.760> advantage<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.750> are

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
they take that advantage and they are

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.500 
they take that advantage and they are
probably<00:00:46.260> attacking<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.760> point<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> view<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
probably attacking my point of view is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.569 
probably attacking my point of view is
like<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.289> besides<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> saving<00:00:50.460> energy

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
like I think besides the saving energy

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.510 
like I think besides the saving energy
for<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> safety<00:00:51.750> issue<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.340> I've

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
for me as a safety issue I you know I've

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
for me as a safety issue I you know I've
seen<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:53.910> guys<00:00:54.120> getting<00:00:54.480> hurt<00:00:54.649> some<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
seen those guys getting hurt some of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.740 
seen those guys getting hurt some of
them<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:55.949> hurt<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.660> know

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
them very hurt maybe it's a you know

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
them very hurt maybe it's a you know
it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.109> career-ending<00:00:58.920> maybe<00:00:59.129> sometimes<00:00:59.609> so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's a career-ending maybe sometimes so

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
it's a career-ending maybe sometimes so
I<00:00:59.820> think<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.350> pretty<00:01:01.590> steamed

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
I think it's it's it's pretty steamed

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.700 
I think it's it's it's pretty steamed
what<00:01:02.039> they<00:01:02.160> did<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:03.030> 90<00:01:03.420> km/h<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.350> likes<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
what they did at 90 km/h the likes of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.859 
what they did at 90 km/h the likes of
Nibelungs<00:01:04.979> again<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.090> assess<00:01:06.390> even<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.720> most

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
Nibelungs again can assess even the most

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.530 
Nibelungs again can assess even the most
finite<00:01:07.439> details<00:01:07.880> natural<00:01:08.880> talent<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
finite details natural talent can go a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
finite details natural talent can go a
long<00:01:09.750> way<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.409> Oscar<00:01:10.740> believes<00:01:11.010> many<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
long way but Oscar believes many of the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
long way but Oscar believes many of the
techniques<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.299> taught<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
techniques can be taught I think the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.460 
techniques can be taught I think the
important<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.340> knowing<00:01:15.119> how<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
important thing is like knowing how to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.990 
important thing is like knowing how to
read<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> road<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:17.100> quick<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> add<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
read the road very quick and add that to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
read the road very quick and add that to
every<00:01:18.330> single<00:01:18.780> corner<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.229> find<00:01:19.500> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
every single corner you find it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
every single corner you find it
immediately<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.420> need<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> guess<00:01:21.900> what's

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
immediately you need to guess what's

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
immediately you need to guess what's
coming<00:01:22.409> next<00:01:22.650> what's<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> next<00:01:23.400> corner<00:01:23.729> gonna

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
coming next what's the next corner gonna

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
coming next what's the next corner gonna
be<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.200> also<00:01:25.380> an<00:01:25.560> ability<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
be like so that's also an ability you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.190 
be like so that's also an ability you
need<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> develop<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> one<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.960> then

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
need to develop so that is one and then

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
need to develop so that is one and then
the<00:01:28.380> rest<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.950> okay<00:01:29.280> how<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.570> guy

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
a good designer because i'm not one of

the best climbers in the peloton so

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.990 
the best climbers in the peloton so
sometimes<00:01:59.990> i<00:02:00.259> have<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.710> take<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.789> come

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
back to the first group and yeah then

can<00:03:23.450> manage<00:03:23.900> risk<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.549> think<00:03:25.549> when<00:03:25.639> they<00:03:25.730> have

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
different than the others is like a risk

a<00:03:27.859> little<00:03:28.040> bit<00:03:28.130> more<00:03:28.220> than<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.459> others<00:03:28.670> that

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
a little bit more than the others that

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.330 
a little bit more than the others that
is<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.690> also<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.440> their<00:03:30.590> risk<00:03:30.829> because<00:03:31.160> they

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
is to also but their risk because they

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.240 
is to also but their risk because they
have<00:03:31.459> also<00:03:31.670> better<00:03:31.940> skills<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.829> when<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:34.100> go

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
have also better skills and when you go

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.590 
have also better skills and when you go
