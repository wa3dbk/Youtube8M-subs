you've<00:00:04.049> surely<00:00:04.410> heard<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.950> human<00:00:05.250> evolution

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
you've surely heard of human evolution

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.000 
you've surely heard of human evolution
let's<00:00:06.210> say<00:00:06.420> it<00:00:06.540> goes<00:00:06.750> something<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.319> we

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
let's say it goes something like this we

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.500 
let's say it goes something like this we
used<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.340> live<00:00:08.490> in<00:00:08.519> trees<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.150> hunt<00:00:09.300> woolly

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
used to live in trees and hunt woolly

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.749 
used to live in trees and hunt woolly
mammoths<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.380> discovered<00:00:10.920> fire<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.460> figured

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
mammoths we discovered fire and figured

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.759 
mammoths we discovered fire and figured
out<00:00:11.849> how<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.059> make<00:00:12.240> tools<00:00:12.509> then<00:00:13.349> there<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
out how to make tools then there was the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.460 
out how to make tools then there was the
wheel<00:00:13.980> after<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:15.120> modern<00:00:15.540> society<00:00:15.690> took<00:00:16.260> off

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
wheel after that modern society took off

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.980 
wheel after that modern society took off
then<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.699> got<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.060> electricity<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.720> took<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
then we got into electricity and took a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.650 
then we got into electricity and took a
giant<00:00:19.199> leap<00:00:19.380> forward<00:00:19.800> but<00:00:20.640> maybe<00:00:20.910> that's<00:00:21.390> only

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
giant leap forward but maybe that's only

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.170 
giant leap forward but maybe that's only
part<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.170> human<00:00:22.470> development<00:00:23.180> our

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
part of human development our

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.120 
part of human development our
consciousness<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.109> also<00:00:25.289> been<00:00:25.619> developing

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
consciousness has also been developing

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
consciousness has also been developing
maybe<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.730> run<00:00:26.939> out<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> room<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
maybe it's run out of room and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
maybe it's run out of room and
wakefulness<00:00:27.900> that's<00:00:28.590> why<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.980> already<00:00:29.310> been

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
wakefulness that's why it's already been

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
wakefulness that's why it's already been
spilling<00:00:29.789> over<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> long<00:00:30.510> time<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
spilling over for a long time into the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
spilling over for a long time into the
next<00:00:31.529> closest<00:00:31.980> physiological<00:00:32.759> brain<00:00:32.969> state

next closest physiological brain state

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.900 
next closest physiological brain state
so<00:00:33.719> called<00:00:34.020> REM<00:00:34.590> sleep<00:00:34.800> let's<00:00:35.489> call<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
into this state more and more often we

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.560 
into this state more and more often we
believe<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.489> day<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.210> live
