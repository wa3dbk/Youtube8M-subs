00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello a little message from a small 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.250
 video just to explain how 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.230
 works for me not the internships in 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.380
 beginner level animal communication 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.030
 so my goal for this level internship 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 beginner it's really really 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 to really reconnect to your 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.880
 telepathic ability 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.230
 the goal of the game during this course is going 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.400
 to be that you realize that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.869
 you are able to issue 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.490
 the information that usually we did not 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.900
 too much doubt except that one has nothing to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.730
 know if she got there wendo right 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 so go the goal it's mostly 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.030
 receive information to know 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.100
 that you have received a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.480
 information that comes animal and that is 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.770
 just because of course we can 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.370
 to receive a lot of things 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.379
 Is not fair 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.450
 emma the idea it's not going to serve you to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.370
 big thing so the goal during these 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 two days it's going to be working 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 on this technique in quotation marks 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.200
 since we are not going to talk about theory 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.760
 of technique that does not exist we are 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 really on a choir communication 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 at heart but really to develop 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.250
 this ability to come to emit 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.289
 information and to receive from 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.910
 information and that all this is bound 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.469
 which is obviously an answer 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.140
 appropriate to the question asked 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 otherwise it's not too funny so here we 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.799
 will tackle all this during a good 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.689
 morning and then I gave you a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.100
 connection protocol that will be very 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.750
 simple but that will allow you to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 center your mind to really go 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 in the heart it's not the protocol 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 obviously it will evolve with time 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 it's always the same you go 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.369
 do your all these techniques and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.720
 then we 'll talk about tic because it's 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.920
 something that is close to my heart 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 is really important for me to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.549
 know animal communication 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500
 it's great it's great but what's it 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 it will serve me behind me we can 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220
 do lots of things 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.070
 the goal of the game is obviously not to 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.450
 serve the animals and then and not on 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 two days it stays a day and a half 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.680
 does not hurt a day and a half overall 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.450
 to practice practice practicing and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.579
 you go practice on photos 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.350
 only that is to say that you do not 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 will not come with your companion animals 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.950
 they will stay home quietly 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.720
 it's quite difficult to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 move the horses so it's better 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.020
 for everyone if he stays at home 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 so you're going to read mostly with the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.110
 pictures of your pet companion if you 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.670
 do not have it does not matter you 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.979
 will play with the animals of others but 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.810
 globally we need animals for 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.759
 to be able to play because it's really 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.580
 we're going to have fun for two days and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.980
 You will play 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.320
 with pictures of other animals 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.120
 people from the internship ie 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.380
 animals you do not know you 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.600
 prepare questions that we are going 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.580
 exchange questions and then you 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.810
 go ask his questions and then the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.580
 other people will be there and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.460
 mutually to validate the answers 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.930
 or the invalids and but it's like that 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.670
 you have to make mistakes to learn 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.620
 and find out why we made a mistake 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.360
 so that's how it's going to be and 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.670
 then of course one and the beginning of the internship 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.770
 we will leave we will drop the luggage 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.630
 emotional all that blocks this channel 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.790
 since it's still so many 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.290
 pipes in fact between the animal and 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.450
 you even so all that blocks this 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.830
 channel the emotions the missing animals 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.660
 you do not necessarily know how to leave 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.670
 to leave all these difficulties 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.160
 well I'll be here to help you 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.440
 drop them off to accompany you 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.209
 really for two days so I'll have 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.530
 a lot a lot of fun to 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.120
 to receive you during these two days 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.890
 I hope we can walk together 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.920
 and I wish you a lot of happiness 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.650
 to reactivate this ability because it 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.680
 there is a before and after and I really 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.360
 you wish it so I tell you to very 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.530
 soon if you have any questions well 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.530
 heard do not hesitate
