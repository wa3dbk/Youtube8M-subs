00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
there's a lot of it and I colored it so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.200 
there's a lot of it and I colored it so
it's<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> little<00:00:34.739> damaged<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.550> takes<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> little

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it's a little damaged it takes a little

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
it's a little damaged it takes a little
longer<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.809> dry<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> sponge<00:00:37.500> roller<00:00:37.860> than

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
longer to dry and a sponge roller than

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.060 
longer to dry and a sponge roller than
it<00:00:38.160> does<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.340> them<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:39.840> beta<00:00:40.500> girls<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> I'm

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
it does in them in beta girls and I'm

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
it does in them in beta girls and I'm
assuming<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.579> because<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.420> sponge<00:00:42.719> roll

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
assuming it's because it's a sponge roll

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
assuming it's because it's a sponge roll
and<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> sucks<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.680> moisture<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.910> good

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and it sucks the moisture all that good

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.170 
and it sucks the moisture all that good

separation<00:06:11.950> lines<00:06:12.340> from<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:12.760> rollers<00:06:13.060> which

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
separation lines from the rollers which

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.490 
separation lines from the rollers which
I<00:06:13.660> kind<00:06:14.230> of<00:06:14.340> don't<00:06:15.340> like<00:06:15.670> but<00:06:16.300> I<00:06:16.750> really<00:06:17.320> like
