00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.629
 Hello 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 Y 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 or wool beds this is anime frame 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.239
 welcome to this new video in the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.680
 which I will tell you what I think about the eye 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.270
 from soro 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.190
 remember here more than what I will say is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 just what I think so if you do not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.800
 like this theory please do not fill 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.840
 of hate saying this let's start all 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.879
 we know that since the time is free two 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.730
 years the very guards suffered some 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.739
 changes in its appearance however the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.559
 most controversial of all has been that of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.790
 soro and his scar in his left eye 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.450
 so even my mother asked me 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.219
 how has happened with soro's eye 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.170
 I would like to start by discarding a theory 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.390
 that I've seen in some forums that says 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000
 that he just simply lost his eye on the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.710
 training with my son I do not see this 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 possible since if it were something so 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.060
 simple I think that by now I 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 we would know so I think that only still 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.800
 he keeps his eye besides the scar that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.840
 this one has in his eye is very thin and if 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.420
 we look at the sants we will see that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.860
 it's much thicker so it's obvious that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.540
 the wound of sants was 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.570
 I more serious than any court that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
 have suffered only in his left eye 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 said this to me he only has one eye 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.260
 new since if you look at the manga 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.060
 809 we can see how he talks to 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.890
 soro and tells him that he is fed up with 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960
 have powers in their eyes and who wants 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 dedicate to have a little daughter with shake 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.620
 so he agreed to give him 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.660
 short or not in sharing and see not the 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.640
 first great so could only have the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.150
 power needed to become the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.990
 wise of the 500 roads of one piece ok 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.729
 what a stupid and incoherent theory and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.520
 so let's get serious and let's 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.950
 return the first ace to win it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.869
 I'm serious, I think the eye 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 treasure has nothing special and that 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.709
 simply this one keeps it closed 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.810
 as a form of training since 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.850
 when you have a closed eye it decreases 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.770
 your vision and perception so only 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.150
 Keep your eye closed to open it 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.890
 when it's up to him to face a 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.380
 very powerful adversary like a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.510
 admiral a high command union with or 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.430
 something like that and like I said 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560
 above I do not think it is 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.690
 I just lost my eye 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.160
 I think now hold so much suspense 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.410
 with this theme just to troll 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.150
 another function that I see the eye of only 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.310
 is that it also keeps it closed 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.230
 to use it in the dark as there 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 legends that some pirates used 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.400
 a patch in one eye still without being one-eyed 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.170
 just to adapt it to the darkness and so 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.270
 they could be able to fight in the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.430
 darkness so maybe all of it is 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.800
 basing on these legends to give you a 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.780
 use to soro's eye would not be the first 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.230
 Once oda relates legends or 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.640
 stories of real pirates with their manga 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.340
 this is what I think will happen to the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.320
 soro eye did not want to abound much in the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
 theme since really anything 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.220
 can happen and the data to formulate 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.370
 a theory in regards to this are not very 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.280
 concrete good nothing else up here the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.740
