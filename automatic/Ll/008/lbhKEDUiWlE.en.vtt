00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 so hello people 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.519
 Today I am at a start 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.010
 it 's very hard to reach 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 So that means I can not do it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.280
 I suspect on foot lerchenberg on the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.860
 The place itself is very nice 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.700
 well , so I see you here 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 me to mine 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.820
 almost impossible to recognize 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.590
 it's easy to sit on it 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 I'm also very well positioned 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.130
 Here are two game changes and then I have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.420
 here's a salt yummy I have 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.420
 also just a bit stocked 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.460
 and yes now I want here 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.410
 she was already the Black Forest 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.190
 swirl broken 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:28.050
 on this beautiful tall tree and 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.290
 make beech wood teachers and have there 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.060
 I have something new organized time 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.990
 also and indeed there is a nice now 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 new bauble and that is it 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.229
 beech wood to spray it from him 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.300
 a canister with sledges no bucket 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.570
 with brush or other but me 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.800
 I have a very simple spray can with me 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.800
 of course the amis cost say 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.259
 about 110 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:04.619
 the fixe is half a liter in it and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.729
 should work pretty well here for 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.070
 spray that would like now 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:14.880
 Try on the room advantage of the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.950
 things are once I have the mess 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.610
 not with the brush and me all over 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.840
 dealer full 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 the other is that you got me from 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:33.360
 smelly bucket somewhere in the car and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:35.380
 The woman stirs back on bonuses come 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.400
 young lady 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.660
 and because as you said in Europe nokia 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 and the problems about and then 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.050
 look how optimization is assumed 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.600
 As I said here is a bit chosen 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.020
 I want to do that on the tree and 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.020
 then look 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 beautiful 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:02.519
 the whole thing was so smell does ever 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.860
 good and is now but do not look 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.260
 quite as viscous as I like that 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.860
 know but it is now good on here 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.680
 the surface of what it is then was here 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.289
 in the profile a pity to part of the synonymous 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.889
 well, that means there it is 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.979
 it will also be easy to rub 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:26.250
 and so hump out so that seems so 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.229
 to be very interesting and then 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.740
 let's see if the picture is the stuff 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.740
 takes
