gently with the wax and I just shape out
the<00:00:58.320> point<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.699> does<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.149> dark

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.100 
the point now this does look very dark
right<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
right now but this is just to make the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.030 
right now but this is just to make the
shape<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:05.640> bit<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:06.750> defined<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.860> once

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
shape a little bit more defined so once

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.590 
shape a little bit more defined so once
I'm<00:01:08.159> happy<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> point<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.000> will<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.390> go

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I'm happy with the point I will then go

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
I'm happy with the point I will then go
in<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> powder<00:01:10.409> Basin<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.070> use<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
in with the powder Basin I use the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.880 
in with the powder Basin I use the
powder<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> make<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.659> eyebrows<00:01:13.080> more<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.799> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
powder is to make my eyebrows more of a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
powder is to make my eyebrows more of a
defined<00:01:14.220> shape<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> blocks<00:01:15.299> out<00:01:15.570> all<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
defined shape and it blocks out all of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
defined shape and it blocks out all of
the<00:01:16.140> gaps<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> between<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> take

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the gaps that are in between so I take

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850 
the gaps that are in between so I take
the<00:01:17.880> brush<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.479> go<00:01:18.960> along<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the brush and I just go along the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:35.330 
the brush and I just go along the
natural<00:01:20.220> shape<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.759> eyebrow

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.380 

so<00:01:36.340> we're<00:01:36.460> just<00:01:36.490> following<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.210> natural

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
so we're just following the natural

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.130 
so we're just following the natural
eyebrow<00:01:38.080> shape<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.740> making<00:01:39.369> it<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:40.300> bit<00:01:40.660> more

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
eyebrow shape and making it a bit more

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.800 
eyebrow shape and making it a bit more
defined<00:01:41.590> here<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.850> right<00:01:43.000> side<00:01:43.300> done<00:01:43.540> and

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
defined here is the right side done and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.050 
defined here is the right side done and
here<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.259> left<00:01:44.470> side<00:01:44.610> naturally<00:01:45.610> now<00:01:46.030> I

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
here is the left side naturally now I

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.760 
here is the left side naturally now I
don't<00:01:46.300> need<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:46.840> do<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.290> my<00:01:47.409> eyebrows

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
don't need to do this to my eyebrows

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.410 
don't need to do this to my eyebrows
it's<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.280> more<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.640> personal<00:01:49.150> preference

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
it's just more of a personal preference

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.810 
it's just more of a personal preference
but<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.320> can<00:01:50.500> see<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:51.100> difference<00:01:51.520> already

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
but you can see the difference already

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.359
