00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.899
 very good evening we are live and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.720
 exclusively on the cj tv sports for 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.329
 advance the last hour of the world here 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.989
 ends the game of Spain has lost 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.030
 and lose in that I laugh 15 but it has been 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.790
 the truth that a bad match of the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.440
 Spanish team and the first part 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:59.250
 it was good until in the 43rd minute 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.589
 took the van Persie goal from head and 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.470
 from there was a moral rush 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:08.130
 favorable to holland in the second part 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.619
 came four goals two ruben one 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.619
 of van persie and one of reach 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.500
 when spain scored xabi alonso 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.800
 penalty 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.830
 It is the worst nightmare for Spain but 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.440
 there is something positive whenever Spain 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.200
 starts looking global 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.700
 in the last decade he has always won or 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.130
 be that for now the numbers do not 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.729
 they favor to begin losing the draft 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.110
 there is a possibility of passing but it is very 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.580
 hard 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.080
 and it would be in the case of triple tie to 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.090
 six would have to score in a match 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.060
 a difference of four goals and in another 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.190
 party would have to score a goal and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 you take and that's it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.280
 this is how Spain would pass 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.210
 sure and then good depends on the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.280
 other results 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.569
 and if not, then 96 30 and that's it 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.040
 good many thanks for breaking this 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.290
 video 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.710
 do not worry about putting global because 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.550
 Spain can Spain what is going to get 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.500
 squares has had errors and follows 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.790
 being the world's best we're going to have 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.760
 Messi is still the best central 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.030
 world I say coast about the best of 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.010
 world and it has not been fine 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.010
 and tower where he failed without goalkeeper 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.069
