drive shaft and it has to be installed

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.880 
drive shaft and it has to be installed
one<00:02:01.090> particular<00:02:01.660> way<00:02:01.990> only<00:02:02.350> if<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.620> don't<00:02:02.770> do

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
one particular way only if you don't do

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.180 
one particular way only if you don't do
it<00:02:03.010> right<00:02:03.160> you'll<00:02:03.400> screw<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:03.910> up<00:02:04.000> every<00:02:04.120> time

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
it right you'll screw it up every time

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.310 
it right you'll screw it up every time
the<00:02:06.190> idea<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.730> key<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.630> slide<00:02:07.870> it<00:02:08.020> on<00:02:08.140> the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
the idea is the key to slide it on the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.150 
the idea is the key to slide it on the
tool<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:09.160> just<00:02:09.490> like<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.840> want<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
tool like just like this so you want the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.199 
tool like just like this so you want the
black<00:02:15.160> lip<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.940> want<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.180> facing<00:02:16.630> outward<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
black lip you want it facing outward and

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.490 
black lip you want it facing outward and
the<00:02:19.209> same<00:02:19.420> thing<00:02:19.660> for<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.930> yellow<00:02:20.110> lip<00:02:20.380> you

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the same thing for the yellow lip you

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.900 
the same thing for the yellow lip you
want<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.770> facing<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.250> where<00:02:21.459> they<00:02:21.580> both<00:02:21.730> need

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
want it facing out where they both need

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.610 
want it facing out where they both need
to<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.030> facing<00:02:22.480> outward<00:02:22.780> when<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.470> gets

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
to be facing outward when it gets

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.860 
to be facing outward when it gets
installed<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.690> want<00:02:28.840> to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
installed just like that you want to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.060 
installed just like that you want to
make<00:02:28.990> sure<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.200> doesn't<00:02:29.410> get<00:02:29.500> folded<00:02:29.830> in<00:02:29.980> on

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
make sure it doesn't get folded in on

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.590 
make sure it doesn't get folded in on
itself<00:02:30.130> when<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.670> put<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.030> because<00:02:31.330> it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
itself when you put it on because it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.470 
itself when you put it on because it
will<00:02:31.750> leak<00:02:31.959> guaranteed<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.880> next<00:02:34.120> step<00:02:34.300> is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
will leak guaranteed the next step is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.570 
will leak guaranteed the next step is
line<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.290> right<00:02:35.560> up<00:02:35.620> here<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.870> shaft<00:02:38.580> you

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
line it right up here with the shaft you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.670 
line it right up here with the shaft you
should<00:02:39.760> be<00:02:39.910> able<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.120> slide<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.690> right<00:02:40.990> on<00:02:41.350> to

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
should be able to slide it right on to

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.759 
should be able to slide it right on to
the<00:02:41.830> shaft<00:02:42.760> just<00:02:43.269> like<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.500> you'll<00:02:44.620> know

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
the shaft just like that and you'll know

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.680 
the shaft just like that and you'll know
it's<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.130> right<00:02:45.340> because<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.030> don't<00:02:46.269> have<00:02:46.540> any

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
it's on right because you don't have any

lubrication many kind put them in so
let's<00:03:58.020> make<00:03:58.140> sure<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:59.280> facing<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.700> way

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
let's make sure it's facing this way

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.230 
let's make sure it's facing this way
when<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> go<00:04:00.210> to<00:04:00.270> put<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.570> in<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.680> way

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
when you go to put it in not that way

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.730 
when you go to put it in not that way
okay<00:04:04.340> now<00:04:05.630> this<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.990> tricky<00:04:07.260> part<00:04:07.290> here

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
okay now this is the tricky part here

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.850 
okay now this is the tricky part here
