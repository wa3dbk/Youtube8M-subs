actually building their own hardware for
this<00:00:40.200> thing<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.920> course<00:00:40.969> windows<00:00:41.969> 8<00:00:42.180> will

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
this thing and of course windows 8 will

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.350 
this thing and of course windows 8 will
be<00:00:42.600> running<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.379> Windows<00:00:44.309> 8<00:00:44.520> tablet<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

be running on this Windows 8 tablet so
basically<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.989> microsoft<00:00:46.500> surface<00:00:46.710> tablet

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
basically this microsoft surface tablet

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910 
basically this microsoft surface tablet
will<00:00:47.579> offer<00:00:47.850> two<00:00:48.660> different<00:00:48.690> options<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
will offer two different options for the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.240 
will offer two different options for the
PC<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.510> basically<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.410> powered<00:00:53.010> by

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
PC it's basically going to be powered by
