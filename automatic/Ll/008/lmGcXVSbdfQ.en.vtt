00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 cheap not premium quality but all 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.390
 equally better than nothing so fastening 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.840
 normal fastening it turns in all 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.240
 planes method us on the glass when 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.330

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 so I will call to the rear window 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.649

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 on the video recorders with this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.070

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.489
 power connections on this side of the card 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.280

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.850

 2 hours in my time for two hours of filming 4 4 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.240
 4 but better speed se 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.310
 there is no slow down, it will improve more 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 the speed was faster the battery was written on 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.070
 it as on the phone nokia bl-5c 6 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.030
 light bulbs in night vision but 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.009
 honestly I donâ€™t know in the city they are looking for and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.979
 as more or less when illuminating the streets 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.590
 visible but on the track 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.530
 a small spot of light and everything and more 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.460
 nothing else is visible 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.040
 the darkness is solid 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.810
 so start DVR 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.000
 DVR to start recording 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.400
 You can either click on the buttons on the button 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.710
 start or when it is powered only 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.759
 you are feeding cigarette lighter here 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.380
 and he immediately writes he means on this 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.380
 on the monitor tsiferki red 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.319
 go to the menu when he writes go to the menu 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.650
 You can not press the menu button 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.280
 then the menu should stop recording 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.050
 white numbers and go to the menu click 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.120
 menu menu appears on here pretty 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.269
 yet all this elementary factory 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.430
 the settings in principle did not touch them and did not 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.349
 it and therefore nobody nothing much 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.000
 I can't tell you anything good 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.750
 I will tell you that he is there than I am 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.950
 I used to go away with the buttons 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.800
 downs up and down 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.069
 rearrange the date and time of the video 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.120
 time that is, go to the menu, press 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.569

 minutes 1 minutes two or three 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.090
 Well, for example, I will leave for 15 minutes because 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.250
 that when going from movie to movie goes 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.549
 there a couple of minutes of it a couple of seconds, some 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.319
 the dead that is and therefore the more 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.090
 videos the more these seconds will be 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.030
 which dvr at this moment 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.400

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.459
