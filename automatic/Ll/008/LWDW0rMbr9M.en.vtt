our chops and developing our finger
dexterity<00:00:03.360> I've<00:00:03.929> created<00:00:04.410> what<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.650> call<00:00:04.740> the

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
dexterity I've created what I call the

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.430 
dexterity I've created what I call the
spider<00:00:05.580> walk<00:00:05.819> obstacle<00:00:06.330> course<00:00:06.569> that's<00:00:07.080> going

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
spider walk obstacle course that's going

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.499 
spider walk obstacle course that's going
up<00:00:07.529> do<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.189> spider<00:00:08.370> walk<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.790> first<00:00:09.000> fret

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.640 

I'm<00:00:12.509> just<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.080> quickly<00:00:13.230> just

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
I'm just going to do this quickly just

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.099 
I'm just going to do this quickly just
to<00:00:13.799> explain<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:17.359> once<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> top<00:00:18.930> I'm

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
to explain it once I get to the top I'm

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:30.500 
to explain it once I get to the top I'm
going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> scoot<00:00:19.529> over<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.830> half-step<00:00:29.420> once<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
going to scoot over a half-step once I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.759 
going to scoot over a half-step once I
get<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> bottom<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.679> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
get to the bottom there I'm going to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.650 
get to the bottom there I'm going to
scoot<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.099> again<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.600> to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
scoot up again but now I'm going to

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.540 
scoot up again but now I'm going to
start<00:00:33.809> adding<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.770> techniques<00:00:35.160> like

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
start adding in little techniques like

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.959 
start adding in little techniques like
staccato<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.690> playing<00:00:36.930> every<00:00:37.320> single<00:00:37.350> new

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
staccato that's playing every single new

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.549 
staccato that's playing every single new
very<00:00:38.969> short<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> third

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
very short so when you get to the third

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.250 
very short so when you get to the third
fret<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> obstacle<00:00:41.579> course<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.930> play<00:00:43.110> all

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

those notes nice and short staccato
style<00:01:09.260> okay<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> bottom

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
style okay so now I'm at the bottom

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649 
style okay so now I'm at the bottom

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
there I'm again I'm going to scoot up a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
there I'm again I'm going to scoot up a
half-step<00:01:12.840> I'm<00:01:13.560> still<00:01:13.860> doing<00:01:14.040> spider<00:01:14.280> walks

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
half-step I'm still doing spider walks

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
half-step I'm still doing spider walks
but<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:14.850> adding<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.570> techniques

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but I'm adding more and more techniques

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.140 
but I'm adding more and more techniques
to<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:17.070> I'm<00:01:17.159> trying<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:17.640> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the fifth fret is a little bit of

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.570 
the fifth fret is a little bit of
vibrato<00:01:20.990> I'm<00:01:21.990> gonna<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> whole<00:01:22.830> spider

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
vibrato I'm gonna go up the whole spider

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.719 
vibrato I'm gonna go up the whole spider
walk<00:01:24.080> shaking<00:01:25.080> each<00:01:25.229> new<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> great

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
walk shaking each new this is a great

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.280 
walk shaking each new this is a great
exercise<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.540> builds<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
exercise it really builds up a lot of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:49.969 
exercise it really builds up a lot of
strength<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.409> top<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.890> all

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
strength so I get to the top and all

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.170 
strength so I get to the top and all
these<00:01:50.070> high<00:01:50.280> strings<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.729> may<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
these high strings I may have to do a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.789 
these high strings I may have to do a
classical<00:01:51.689> style<00:01:51.750> vibrato<00:01:52.170> which<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> back

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
classical style vibrato which is back

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.060 
classical style vibrato which is back
and<00:01:53.040> forth

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
and forth

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:03.240

rather than up and down sendin from nine

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:14.699 
rather than up and down sendin from nine
to<00:02:03.850> six<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.729> nine<00:02:07.210> eight<00:02:08.250> seven<00:02:09.250> six<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:13.709> get
