00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 but to work to go back in the year 1982 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:16.890
 since then he went to work in the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.070
 night shift I'm like a year and a half 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 then it happens but to work in painting and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 there I was is approximately until 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.439
 year 2003 I think it was then happened to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.439
 work to quality 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:41.219
 for me it was the factory that actually 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.600
 it was not a good place to enter had 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.390
 ability to work manually 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 so I was not afraid to work in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.149
 a chain and it was a job 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.149
 nice 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.949
 in painting I went through the phase I started 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.270
 by the phase of changing pieces in the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.180
 cars of the moving parts that 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.190
 they call the doors and gates when one 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.070
 it was bad it changed so that it was 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.420
 well then I started painting I was in the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.880
 cabin a few months in the painting then 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.140
 I went to the polished area that is where 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.280
 Pass the cars arrived 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.270
 painted and you review them all the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.750
 structure of the painting that does not have 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.000
 impurities 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.760
 are the three phases that I work for 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.730
 in painting that then it came very well to you 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.310
 the time to go to quality to know the 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.310
 structure of the paint and the folios of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.690
 the sheet comes in handy because then the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.020
 you see much easier than it is and it is not 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.009
 worked on 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.009
 in structures 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.400
 and I am fine and much more because it is 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.190
 where I have lived more years worked 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.380
 then when working a fixed thing of 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.680
 tomorrow I have dealt with a lot more 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 people because you deal with the three shifts 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.330
 you know more people and you get very rich 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.330
 plus 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.730
 that leaves me a part of my life a 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:18.200
 important part then yes I leave 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.320
 many friends and I try to be friends with 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.790
 all and above all companion of those of 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.560
 the states and I hope I hope the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.940
 others feel the same as I do the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.550
 truth is that I have left many 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.550
 Insa friends in this company very many
