tutorial<00:00:01.500> number<00:00:01.740> two<00:00:01.979> in<00:00:02.220> this<00:00:02.460> tutorial<00:00:02.669> we

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
tutorial number two in this tutorial we

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.829 
tutorial number two in this tutorial we
will<00:00:03.480> start<00:00:04.049> our<00:00:04.440> first<00:00:04.859> sketch<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.569> is

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
will start our first sketch so this is

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.589 
will start our first sketch so this is
the<00:00:07.080> first<00:00:07.560> tutorial<00:00:08.010> we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.300> start

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the first tutorial we're going to start

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.980 
the first tutorial we're going to start
working<00:00:09.840> with<00:00:10.139> sudo<00:00:10.860> doors<00:00:11.330> we<00:00:12.330> sit<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
working with sudo doors we sit to the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.860 
working with sudo doors we sit to the
left<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.559> part<00:00:14.009> tree<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.660> most

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
left you have the part tree and the most

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.460 
left you have the part tree and the most
important<00:00:17.210> things<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.480> look<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.750> right<00:00:19.230> now

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
important things to look at right now

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.250 
important things to look at right now
are<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.340> plants<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.810> three

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
are the plants so you have three

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.070 
are the plants so you have three
different<00:00:22.590> planes<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.570> origin

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
different planes and you have the origin

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
different planes and you have the origin
so<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.859> remember<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> mathematics

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
so if you remember in the mathematics

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
so if you remember in the mathematics
you<00:00:27.269> have<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> origin<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> coordinates

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you have the origin of the coordinates

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.440 
you have the origin of the coordinates
of<00:00:29.179> zero<00:00:30.179> zero<00:00:30.929> zero<00:00:31.759> front<00:00:32.759> plane<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.239> can

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
of zero zero zero front plane you can

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.330 
of zero zero zero front plane you can
imagine<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.460> zip<00:00:35.460> x<00:00:35.930> coordinate<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
imagine it like a zip x coordinate to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.440 
imagine it like a zip x coordinate to
play<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.760> XY<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.520> so<00:00:41.520> these<00:00:42.030> are

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
play in the XY and so on so these are

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590 
play in the XY and so on so these are
the<00:00:43.020> views<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> planes<00:00:44.520> where<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.390> are

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the views or the planes where you are

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.229 
the views or the planes where you are
able<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> start<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.559> sketching<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
able to start your sketching so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.150 
able to start your sketching so
depending<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.079> orientation<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.920> your

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
depending on the orientation of your

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.180 
depending on the orientation of your
parts<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.390> want<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.920> select

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
parts or how you want it you can select

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.720 
parts or how you want it you can select
the<00:00:53.520> plane<00:00:53.730> new<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:55.020> once<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.730> choose

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the plane new one so once you choose

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.709 
the plane new one so once you choose
your<00:00:56.789> plane<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.670> click<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.539> see

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
your plane and click on it you will see

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.250 
your plane and click on it you will see
this<00:01:01.350> sketch<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.329> means<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.930> able

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this sketch so that means you are able

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
this sketch so that means you are able
to<00:01:04.500> insert<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.159> sketch<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.060> plane<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
to insert a sketch on that plane so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
to insert a sketch on that plane so
let's<00:01:07.380> click<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.510> able<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
let's click on it now we are able to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
let's click on it now we are able to
make<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.770> sketching<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.750> sketch<00:01:13.020> menu<00:01:13.770> here

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
make a sketching so the sketch menu here

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.480 
make a sketching so the sketch menu here
is<00:01:14.430> activated<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.189> have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
is activated you go to it so you have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.390 
is activated you go to it so you have
the<00:01:18.180> sketch<00:01:18.750> tools<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:22.040> starting<00:01:23.040> from

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the sketch tools so it is starting from

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.179 
the sketch tools so it is starting from
line<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.780> simplest<00:01:25.409> tool<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.820> corner<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.950> on

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.219 

so<00:01:32.189> we're<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> look<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.750> these

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
so we're going to have a look on these

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.710 
so we're going to have a look on these
sketch<00:01:34.650> tools<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.170> next<00:01:37.170> tutorials<00:01:38.720> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
sketch tools in the next tutorials so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
sketch tools in the next tutorials so
now<00:01:39.930> let's<00:01:40.320> start<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.970> line<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.369> let's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
now let's start with the line and let's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.510 
now let's start with the line and let's
start<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> origin<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.020> Sir<00:01:46.979> George<00:01:47.310> is

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
start from the origin so Sir George is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.080 
start from the origin so Sir George is
user-friendly<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.259> give<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.939> marking<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
user-friendly so it give you marking to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.679 
user-friendly so it give you marking to
you<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.420> helping<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.670> choose<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:54.240> points

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you I'm helping to choose your points

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.980 
you I'm helping to choose your points
and<00:01:54.950> if<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> bottom<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.960> will

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and if you look at the bottom you will

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.649 
and if you look at the bottom you will
see<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> coordinates<00:01:58.829> few<00:01:59.700> points<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.270> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
see the coordinates few points of you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.120 
see the coordinates few points of you
put<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.250> origin<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.939> will<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.869> 0<00:02:04.740> 0

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
put it on the origin you will get a 0 0

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.750 
put it on the origin you will get a 0 0
or<00:02:06.560> coordinates<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.310> now<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:09.229> see<00:02:10.229> your

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
or coordinates so now you can see your

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.610 
or coordinates so now you can see your
coordinates<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.840> let's<00:02:14.049> start<00:02:14.349> from<00:02:14.530> the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
coordinates here so let's start from the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.929 
coordinates here so let's start from the
origin<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.569> now<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.920> length<00:02:18.640> of

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
origin and now you can see the length of

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:24.449 
origin and now you can see the length of
your<00:02:19.780> line<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:22.049> Latin<00:02:23.049> for<00:02:23.079> tool<00:02:23.500> so

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
your line so that is Latin for tool so

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.479 
your line so that is Latin for tool so
you<00:02:24.519> know<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:28.439> approximate<00:02:29.439> length<00:02:29.650> instead

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
you know the approximate length instead

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.580 
you know the approximate length instead
of<00:02:30.790> making<00:02:31.209> small<00:02:31.450> lines<00:02:31.689> or<00:02:31.959> bigger<00:02:32.349> lines

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
of making small lines or bigger lines

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.030 
of making small lines or bigger lines
and<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.900> three-dimension<00:02:34.900> them<00:02:35.109> that<00:02:35.799> might

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and then three-dimension them that might

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.000 
and then three-dimension them that might
miss<00:02:36.430> your<00:02:36.760> sketch<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.689> pick<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.829> to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
miss your sketch so you can pick it to

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.759 
miss your sketch so you can pick it to
be<00:02:42.329> for<00:02:43.329> example<00:02:43.780> 100<00:02:44.170> millimeter<00:02:45.720> then<00:02:46.769> when

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
be for example 100 millimeter then when

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.399 
be for example 100 millimeter then when
you<00:02:47.889> click<00:02:48.129> use<00:02:48.670> selecting<00:02:49.299> your<00:02:49.510> point<00:02:49.780> you

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
you click use selecting your point you

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.750 
you click use selecting your point you
are<00:02:50.440> still<00:02:50.859> able<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.310> use<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.810> line<00:02:53.230> tool<00:02:53.760> so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
are still able to use the line tool so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.420 
are still able to use the line tool so
when<00:02:54.879> you<00:02:54.970> are<00:02:55.120> done<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:56.319> can<00:02:56.349> click<00:02:56.590> escape

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
when you are done you can click escape

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.559 
when you are done you can click escape
or<00:02:58.200> right-click<00:02:59.200> select<00:02:59.739> the<00:03:00.609> pin<00:03:00.879> your<00:03:01.329> line

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
or right-click select the pin your line

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.619 
or right-click select the pin your line
to<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.950> other<00:03:03.129> thing<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.970> use<00:03:04.120> with<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.420> line

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
to the other thing to use with the line

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.039 
to the other thing to use with the line
let's<00:03:05.230> lick<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.620> line<00:03:06.209> take<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.389> point<00:03:07.629> where

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
let's lick the line take the point where

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.979 
let's lick the line take the point where
we<00:03:08.260> want<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:10.829> if<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.980> notice<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.970> yellow

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.289 

creation<00:03:16.989> appears<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.099> that<00:03:18.370> means<00:03:18.609> this

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
creation appears to you that means this

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.900 
creation appears to you that means this
line<00:03:19.569> is<00:03:19.840> vertical<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.579> are<00:03:21.639> drawing

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
line is vertical so when you are drawing

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.309 
line is vertical so when you are drawing
you<00:03:22.329> have<00:03:22.359> some<00:03:23.019> relation<00:03:23.500> as<00:03:23.620> well<00:03:25.319> for

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
you have some relation as well for

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.500 
you have some relation as well for
example<00:03:26.410> now<00:03:26.769> if<00:03:26.949> you<00:03:27.180> over<00:03:28.180> over<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:28.900> line

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
example now if you over over this line

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.110 
example now if you over over this line
you<00:03:31.510> are<00:03:31.659> able<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.049> select<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.489> middle<00:03:33.790> point

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
you are able to select the middle point

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.050 
you are able to select the middle point
and<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.500> see<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.919> relation<00:03:36.370> appeared<00:03:36.819> next

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
and you see the relation appeared next

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.080 
and you see the relation appeared next
to<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.510> till<00:03:38.409> you<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.730> middle

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
to that till you that is is a middle

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.399 
to that till you that is is a middle
point<00:03:40.299> so<00:03:41.109> we<00:03:41.379> can<00:03:41.409> pick<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.690> now<00:03:43.930> we<00:03:43.989> know

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
point so we can pick it so now we know

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.409 
point so we can pick it so now we know
there's<00:03:44.680> variations<00:03:46.829> so<00:03:47.829> if<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.389> make<00:03:49.389> it

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
there's variations so if you make it

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.509 
there's variations so if you make it
like<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.109> you<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:51.669> relation<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.780> is

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
like this you have this relation it is

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.409 
like this you have this relation it is
perpendicular<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.479> line<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.909> they<00:03:58.209> are

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
perpendicular to that line so they are

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:03.180 
perpendicular to that line so they are
very<00:03:58.750> helpful<00:03:59.620> tool<00:04:00.129> to<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.889> help<00:04:02.889> you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
very helpful tool to to help you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.939 
very helpful tool to to help you
sketching<00:04:03.639> and<00:04:04.319> accurate<00:04:05.319> in<00:04:05.470> an<00:04:05.650> accurate

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
sketching and accurate in an accurate

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.659 
sketching and accurate in an accurate
way<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.930> if<00:04:08.260> you<00:04:08.500> want<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.829> show<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.190> relations

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
way so if you want to show the relations

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.629 
way so if you want to show the relations
on<00:04:09.849> your<00:04:10.120> sketch<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:11.739> sit<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.370> glasses

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
on your sketch you sit on the glasses

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.140 
on your sketch you sit on the glasses
here<00:04:13.349> you<00:04:14.349> have<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
here you have the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.939 
here you have the
view<00:04:18.139> sketch<00:04:18.560> relations<00:04:20.320> when<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:21.440> selected

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
view sketch relations when you selected

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.340 
view sketch relations when you selected
so<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:22.699> will<00:04:22.940> see<00:04:23.210> the<00:04:23.990> relations<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:25.160> your

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
so you will see the relations in your

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.980 
so you will see the relations in your
sketch<00:04:27.520> so<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.610> have<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.910> midpoints<00:04:29.540> here

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
sketch so you have the midpoints here

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.140 
sketch so you have the midpoints here
how<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:30.949> perpendicular<00:04:32.350> relation<00:04:33.350> and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
how the perpendicular relation and

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.939 
how the perpendicular relation and
intersection<00:04:35.150> here<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:36.410> if<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.680> want<00:04:36.860> to

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
intersection here so if you want to

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.390 
intersection here so if you want to
delete<00:04:38.020> before<00:04:39.020> deleting<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.500> relation<00:04:39.979> if<00:04:40.130> you

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
delete before deleting a relation if you

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.909 
delete before deleting a relation if you
want<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.820> pick<00:04:41.030> that<00:04:41.240> point<00:04:41.540> try<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.530> move<00:04:42.710> it

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
want to pick that point try to move it

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.820 
want to pick that point try to move it
so<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:43.880> are<00:04:44.060> able<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.389> move<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:45.260> whole<00:04:45.410> part

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
so you are able to move the whole part

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.150 
so you are able to move the whole part
so<00:04:46.750> like<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:47.960> continue<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.620> be<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:48.889> the

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
so like this continue to be in the

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.760 
so like this continue to be in the
middle<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.840> let's<00:04:51.229> click<00:04:51.470> this<00:04:51.800> point

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
middle so let's click this point

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.500 
middle so let's click this point
right-click<00:04:54.770> delete<00:04:55.460> or<00:04:57.370> simply<00:04:58.370> click<00:04:58.639> press

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
right-click delete or simply click press

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.080 
right-click delete or simply click press
Delete<00:04:59.870> on<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.200> keyboard<00:05:00.639> so<00:05:01.639> you<00:05:01.700> deleted

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
Delete on the keyboard so you deleted

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.600 
Delete on the keyboard so you deleted
that<00:05:02.210> relation<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.740> you<00:05:03.860> pick<00:05:04.100> that<00:05:04.280> line

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
that relation and if you pick that line

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.290 
that relation and if you pick that line
so<00:05:05.540> you<00:05:05.840> are<00:05:05.990> able<00:05:06.229> to<00:05:06.410> move<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:07.130> freely<00:05:07.880> from

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
so you are able to move it freely from

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.940 
so you are able to move it freely from
that<00:05:08.600> line<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.760> relations<00:05:11.620> playing<00:05:12.620> an

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
that line so the relations playing an

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.969 
that line so the relations playing an
important<00:05:13.520> role<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.850> your<00:05:14.330> sketching<00:05:15.110> so

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
important role in your sketching so

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.770 
important role in your sketching so
sometimes<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.699> need<00:05:16.880> to<00:05:18.550> see<00:05:19.630> for<00:05:20.630> the

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
sometimes you need to see for the

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.850 
sometimes you need to see for the
relation<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.410> are<00:05:21.530> not<00:05:21.710> able<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.600> correct

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
relation if you are not able to correct

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.240 
relation if you are not able to correct
some<00:05:24.860> or<00:05:25.220> move<00:05:26.000> some<00:05:26.300> lines<00:05:26.539> or<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:27.200> on<00:05:27.350> so<00:05:28.130> now

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
some or move some lines or so on so now

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.589 
some or move some lines or so on so now
this<00:05:28.430> return<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.150> duration<00:05:29.479> put<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.910> so<00:05:31.910> we

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
this return that duration put it so we

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.080 
this return that duration put it so we
made<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.840> again<00:05:33.470> here

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
made it again here

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.060
