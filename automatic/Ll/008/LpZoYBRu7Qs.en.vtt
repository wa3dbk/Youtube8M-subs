 Yup 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.489
 Yup 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 I can 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.780
 gentlemen this is fantasy fan viii the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.580
 my second final fantasy in the sense 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.420
 chronological because then he also played 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.490
 to others and is one of the most beautiful 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.760
 chapters of the saga and for playstation 1 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.860
 has a three - dimensional graphics to which 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.980
 many of you for which many of you do not 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.600
 you will be used to is packed with 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.200
 dialogues not 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.170
 not vocal it's all written you balloon is 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.550
 a very long game to complete it at 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.580
 maybe one hundred percent will be needed 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.820
 eighty hours and it really is 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.440
 really very nice one came out 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.330
 remastered version on steam and I of 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.420
 Norman do not treat my channel 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.340
 games ie stretch sequel the old ones 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.900
 I draw games with many dialogues in which 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.570
 I have to be very firm to read them 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.480
 balloon but in this case 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.430
 meanwhile I took it for myself as mine 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.620
 delight 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.400
 so this is a video in which you 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.500
 I ask do you want a series on this game 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.510
 on this channel and don't answer me 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.350
 marcus the channel you do what you do 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:41.260
 you want because for me it is really irrelevant 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.480
 in the sense that if you play privately 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.490
 I'd like to play it to do it for you 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.830
 know for those who don't want to buy it 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.460
 for those who meanwhile if you can buy it 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:56.080
 because it costs a lot if I'm not mistaken 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:58.480
 and let me know if I wanted a game of 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.550
 kind maybe that I'm half an hour a 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.950
 week or you see it all 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.810
 days I don't know because it's really long 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.590
 therefore it will become a channel constant 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:12.400
 maybe all johns every saturdays 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.870
 I will if I have the key now closes me 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.650
 forever 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.170
 I wonder until it's over 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.940
 so that he is well aware of the fact of the 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.190
 the lack of dialogues from the fact that it is 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.590
 a very meticulous game you have to go 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.210
 the hypo and square fi on jules right take 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.890
 the card does not take the card so it is 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.340
 very different from how others play 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.630
 play the very very dispassionately 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.430
 let me know if you feel like doing 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.320
 I experience this game 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.720
 I will play as if I were playing and explaining it 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.550
 to two friend so very much more serious 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.760
 normal maybe a few jokes there 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.610
 escapes though I'm taking a dip in a 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.670
 wonderful videogame past then 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.040
 for me it's exciting 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.520
 let me know in the comments what it is 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.580
