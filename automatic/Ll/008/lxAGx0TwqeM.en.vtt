also<00:01:20.370> at<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> time<00:01:20.790> against<00:01:21.090> us<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.660> what

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
also at a time against us that's what

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.550 
also at a time against us that's what
the<00:01:22.370> you<00:01:23.370> tried<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.730> do<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.440> be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the you tried to do and we get to be

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.960 
the you tried to do and we get to be
better<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:26.570> at<00:01:27.770> managing<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:34.400> no<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.940> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
better at at managing that no we got to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.400 
better at at managing that no we got to
be<00:01:36.120> better<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:38.840> no<00:01:40.520> we<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
be better I think no we can we can do a

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.210 
be better I think no we can we can do a
much<00:01:43.920> better<00:01:43.950> job<00:01:44.250> overall<00:01:45.470> in<00:01:46.470> every<00:01:46.800> aspect

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
much better job overall in every aspect

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.990 
much better job overall in every aspect

that's<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:49.510> up<00:02:49.689> for<00:02:49.870> debate

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.000 

no<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.099> think<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.819> Halifax<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.989> obviously<00:03:02.829> one

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
no I think that Halifax is obviously one

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.039 
no I think that Halifax is obviously one
of<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.159> top<00:03:03.340> teams<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.909> league<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.450> and

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
of the top teams in the league and and

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.539 
of the top teams in the league and and
they<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.680> some<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.010> most<00:03:06.129> talented

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
they have some of the most talented

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:07.860 
they have some of the most talented
players<00:03:06.819> in<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.420> league<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:07.750> they're

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
players in the league and they're

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.679 
players in the league and they're
playing<00:03:08.109> well<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.470> time<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:08.890> no<00:03:09.579> fur<00:03:09.819> sir<00:03:10.480> key

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
playing well this time so no fur sir key

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.629 
playing well this time so no fur sir key
to<00:03:10.780> success<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.530> obviously<00:03:12.220> limit<00:03:12.519> their

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
to success is to obviously limit their

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.160 
to success is to obviously limit their
opportunities<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.269> try<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.510> frustrate<00:03:13.750> them

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
opportunities and try to frustrate them

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.929 
opportunities and try to frustrate them
and<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:15.069> know<00:03:15.159> for<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.370> most<00:03:15.519> part<00:03:15.639> I<00:03:15.790> thought

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
and you know for the most part I thought

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.369 
and you know for the most part I thought
