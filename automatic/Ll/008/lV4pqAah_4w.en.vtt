I<00:00:24.160> just<00:00:25.160> placed<00:00:25.430> some<00:00:25.640> examples<00:00:26.270> of<00:00:26.570> using<00:00:26.990> the

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
I just placed some examples of using the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.510 
I just placed some examples of using the
minor<00:00:28.190> pentatonic<00:00:28.610> scale<00:00:29.540> in<00:00:29.780> this<00:00:30.710> case<00:00:30.770> in

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
minor pentatonic scale in this case in

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.200 
minor pentatonic scale in this case in
the<00:00:31.850> key<00:00:32.149> of<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:33.280> hence<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.550> a<00:00:34.790> minor

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
the key of a hence the a minor

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.290 
the key of a hence the a minor
pentatonic<00:00:35.360> scale<00:00:36.160> mmm<00:00:37.160> pentatonic<00:00:38.120> that

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
pentatonic scale mmm pentatonic that

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.500 
pentatonic scale mmm pentatonic that
means<00:00:38.539> five<00:00:38.929> so<00:00:39.350> it's<00:00:39.499> a<00:00:39.620> five<00:00:40.039> note<00:00:40.489> 5<00:00:41.210> note

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
means five so it's a five note 5 note

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.639 
means five so it's a five note 5 note
scale<00:00:41.539> and<00:00:42.670> if<00:00:43.670> we<00:00:43.850> take<00:00:44.089> we<00:00:45.019> look<00:00:45.199> at<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.440> as<00:00:45.620> a

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
scale and if we take we look at it as a

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.619 
scale and if we take we look at it as a
root<00:00:45.920> note<00:00:46.129> a<00:00:47.019> we<00:00:48.019> have<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:49.219> talking<00:00:49.879> scale<00:00:50.329> step

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
root note a we have a talking scale step

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.469 
root note a we have a talking scale step
now<00:00:50.949> one<00:00:53.739> minor<00:00:54.739> third<00:00:55.300> III<00:00:57.729> for<00:00:58.729> perfect<00:00:59.210> 4th

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
now one minor third III for perfect 4th

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.260 
now one minor third III for perfect 4th

fifth<00:01:03.690> step<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.920> b7

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
fifth step and the b7

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
fifth step and the b7
so<00:01:07.680> it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so it's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.020 
so it's
1b<00:01:10.630> 3<00:01:11.040> 4<00:01:12.040> 5<00:01:12.990> b7<00:01:14.010> that's<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.100> five<00:01:15.310> step<00:01:15.520> then<00:01:15.910> of

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
course one akin to TC boxes so it's one

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
two three four five nodes in the scale

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.890 
two three four five nodes in the scale
and<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:23.620> be<00:01:23.770> able<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.250> play<00:01:24.490> freely<00:01:25.000> over<00:01:25.720> the

and to be able to play freely over the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.400 
and to be able to play freely over the
minor<00:01:26.170> pentatonic<00:01:26.380> scale<00:01:27.010> you<00:01:27.610> need<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.410> know

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
minor pentatonic scale you need to know

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.760 
minor pentatonic scale you need to know
its<00:01:29.740> positions<00:01:30.490> on<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.030> fretboard<00:01:31.330> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
its positions on the fretboard and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.560 
its positions on the fretboard and
there's<00:01:32.770> only<00:01:32.920> five<00:01:33.490> positions<00:01:34.210> on<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
there's only five positions on the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.390 
there's only five positions on the
fretboard<00:01:34.840> hence<00:01:35.320> there's<00:01:35.590> only<00:01:35.740> five<00:01:36.100> notes

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
fretboard hence there's only five notes

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.360 
fretboard hence there's only five notes
that<00:01:36.610> means<00:01:36.850> if<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:37.690> play<00:01:37.900> all<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.470> scale<00:01:39.040> notes

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
that means if I play all the scale notes

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.320 
that means if I play all the scale notes
on<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.760> E<00:01:39.790> string<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:41.110> here<00:01:41.350> first<00:01:43.200> Arthur

can play the scale if you start with the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.279 
can play the scale if you start with the

you<00:03:30.830> can<00:03:30.980> see<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.550> good<00:03:32.360> thing<00:03:32.569> about<00:03:32.599> knowing

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
you can see the good thing about knowing

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.589 
you can see the good thing about knowing
the<00:03:33.650> different<00:03:34.010> positions<00:03:34.550> of<00:03:34.730> scale<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.540> that

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
the different positions of scale is that

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.699 

quite<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:51.760> up<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.510> second<00:03:52.930> position<00:03:53.319> I<00:03:58.709> could

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
quite go up the second position I could

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.430 
quite go up the second position I could
also<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.610> could<00:04:01.390> shift<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.810> position<00:04:01.959> no

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
also to it I could shift the position no

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.900 
also to it I could shift the position no
matter<00:04:02.680> what<00:04:02.860> string<00:04:03.190> I'm<00:04:03.340> on<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.640> could<00:04:03.819> do

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
matter what string I'm on I could do

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.420 
matter what string I'm on I could do
this<00:04:04.890> then<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:06.010> seem<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.580> other<00:04:06.730> magician

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
this then I seem to the other magician

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.270 
this then I seem to the other magician
and<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:09.640> I<00:04:09.730> sit<00:04:09.940> back<00:04:10.239> in<00:04:10.629> this<00:04:10.810> place<00:04:11.280> that's

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
and then I sit back in this place that's

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.670 
and then I sit back in this place that's
the<00:04:12.459> freedom<00:04:18.479> see<00:04:19.479> what<00:04:19.660> I'm<00:04:19.780> getting<00:04:20.410> it

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
the freedom see what I'm getting it

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.870 
the freedom see what I'm getting it
ok<00:04:20.949> this<00:04:21.130> this<00:04:21.549> was<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.910> first<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:23.430> 90<00:04:24.430> seconds

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
ok this this was the first to 90 seconds

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.790 
ok this this was the first to 90 seconds
ok<00:04:27.880> now<00:04:28.210> we<00:04:28.270> just<00:04:28.570> find<00:04:28.810> on<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> E<00:04:29.139> string<00:04:29.260> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
ok now we just find on the E string the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.879 
ok now we just find on the E string the
third<00:04:30.190> note<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.760> scale<00:04:30.880> one<00:04:31.690> two<00:04:32.110> three

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
third note of the scale one two three

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.520 
third note of the scale one two three
and<00:04:33.160> now<00:04:33.729> we<00:04:33.790> play<00:04:34.090> all<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.540> notes<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:34.990> this

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
and now we play all the notes in this

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:44.550 
and now we play all the notes in this
position<00:04:36.450> and<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.600> goes<00:04:37.870> like<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:43.560> it's

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
position and it goes like this so it's

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.149 
position and it goes like this so it's
from<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.889> fourth<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.729> fifth<00:04:46.770> 37th<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.850> boot

professor<00:04:52.300> Paul

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.070 

and<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.830> fingering<00:04:58.310> no<00:04:58.850> when<00:04:59.060> we<00:04:59.210> get<00:04:59.480> up<00:04:59.630> the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
and the fingering no when we get up the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.580 
and the fingering no when we get up the
mall<00:05:00.260> will<00:05:00.440> get<00:05:00.590> up<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.889> neck<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.970> more<00:05:02.590> we

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
mall will get up the neck the more we

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.860 
mall will get up the neck the more we
are<00:05:03.889> inclined<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:04.430> use<00:05:04.520> there<00:05:05.030> where<00:05:05.540> we<00:05:05.690> have

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
are inclined to use there where we have

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.980 
are inclined to use there where we have
a<00:05:06.190> to<00:05:07.190> fret<00:05:07.550> gap<00:05:07.880> we're<00:05:08.180> trying<00:05:08.510> to<00:05:08.660> use<00:05:08.810> the

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
a to fret gap we're trying to use the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.220 
a to fret gap we're trying to use the
first<00:05:09.260> thing<00:05:09.440> instead<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.980> fourth<00:05:10.250> it's

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
first thing instead of the fourth it's

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.110 
first thing instead of the fourth it's
tight<00:05:12.230> here<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:12.650> but<00:05:12.860> sometimes<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.760> use<00:05:13.910> the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
tight here so but sometimes I use the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.000 
tight here so but sometimes I use the
fourth<00:05:14.389> on<00:05:14.600> some<00:05:14.810> of<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.380> third<00:05:15.740> that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
fourth on some of the the third that

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.820 
fourth on some of the the third that
depends<00:05:16.790> on<00:05:16.910> on<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.169> line<00:05:18.410> or<00:05:18.680> the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
depends on on the the line or the

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.070 
depends on on the the line or the
sequence<00:05:19.250> of<00:05:19.370> notes<00:05:19.639> right<00:05:20.570> now<00:05:20.750> I'm<00:05:20.900> using

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
sequence of notes right now I'm using

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.340 
sequence of notes right now I'm using
one<00:05:21.770> for<00:05:22.370> one<00:05:22.880> for<00:05:22.910> one<00:05:23.840> for<00:05:24.410> one<00:05:25.280> for<00:05:26.139> but<00:05:27.139> if

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
one for one for one for one for but if

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.140 
one for one for one for one for but if
I'm<00:05:27.500> going<00:05:27.740> down<00:05:28.300> again<00:05:30.250> I'm<00:05:31.250> like<00:05:31.580> this<00:05:31.880> note

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
I'm going down again I'm like this note

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.409 
I'm going down again I'm like this note
follow<00:05:32.510> about<00:05:32.600> this<00:05:32.900> target<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:35.150> can<00:05:35.270> see

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
follow about this target and you can see

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.159 
follow about this target and you can see
I<00:05:35.450> used<00:05:36.020> a<00:05:36.200> second<00:05:36.710> second<00:05:37.610> figure<00:05:38.140> then<00:05:39.140> you

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
I used a second second figure then you

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.740 
I used a second second figure then you
wouldn't<00:05:39.560> be<00:05:39.910> convenient<00:05:40.910> to<00:05:41.210> have<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.600> first

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
wouldn't be convenient to have the first

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.340 
wouldn't be convenient to have the first
ear<00:05:42.200> and<00:05:42.350> jumping<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:44.330> it<00:05:44.660> depends<00:05:45.020> on<00:05:45.110> what

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
ear and jumping so it depends on what

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.320 
ear and jumping so it depends on what
the<00:05:45.590> what<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.830> lines<00:05:46.340> your<00:05:46.610> you're<00:05:47.030> playing

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
the what the lines your you're playing

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.990 
the what the lines your you're playing
you<00:05:47.870> should<00:05:48.050> be<00:05:48.200> able<00:05:48.290> to<00:05:48.500> do<00:05:48.620> both<00:05:48.830> okay<00:05:49.070> then

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
you should be able to do both okay then

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.240 
you should be able to do both okay then
we<00:05:50.150> have<00:05:50.330> now<00:05:50.780> we<00:05:50.840> have<00:05:51.080> like<00:05:51.290> three<00:05:51.650> positions

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
we have now we have like three positions

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.640 
we have now we have like three positions
and<00:05:52.640> I<00:05:52.790> start<00:05:53.030> all<00:05:53.240> over<00:05:53.300> again<00:05:53.510> is<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:56.650> sorry

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
and I start all over again is it sorry

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.640 
and I start all over again is it sorry
the<00:05:57.889> first<00:05:58.630> and<00:05:59.630> going<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.290> second

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
the first and going to the second

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.370 
the first and going to the second
position<00:06:00.770> they<00:06:01.640> minor<00:06:02.000> pentatonic

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.880 

go<00:06:05.590> through<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.950> third<00:06:06.550> position<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:10.990> again

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
go through the third position and again

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.070 
go through the third position and again
I'll<00:06:12.100> try<00:06:12.370> to<00:06:12.540> to<00:06:13.540> shift<00:06:15.690> from<00:06:16.690> one<00:06:16.780> position

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
I'll try to to shift from one position

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.310 
I'll try to to shift from one position
to<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.530> other<00:06:17.650> like<00:06:18.070> we<00:06:18.190> did<00:06:18.340> before<00:06:18.460> for

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
to the other like we did before for

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:43.950 
to the other like we did before for
example<00:06:40.710> never<00:06:41.710> wrong
