00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 presenting 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.140
 fortune teller do not go to e3 place already 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.850
 obviously 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.840
 this new generation is born on line 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.039
 Ukraine in Kiev 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.929
 just a couple of years ago so beautiful 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.799
 pictures would be enough 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.149
 millions of users like 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.860
 says the client is exactly 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.980
 but now when the star wars the old republic promises 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.579
 plot and incredible innovations 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.359
 I have the authors of the guide book 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.359
 vacation 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.460
 there is an old republic 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.510
 she does not speak and there are three of them at once 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.970
 one global second 2010 and third 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.550
 india 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.470
 rather, it concerns only you and your 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.660
 hero for fidelity action is transferred 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.020
 to whom there is no way to 253 old characters 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.750
 from the first part there will not miss 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.219
 our planet is destroyed and rebuilt 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.329
 door mida it did not wake up and lead over 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.889
 Armenia is a resident of the division as follows 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:44.600
 from the title 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
 never stopped fighting 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.979
 no changes on the phone when 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.100
 look carefully 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.080
 have not seen a single window 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.470
 setting it right is a bad taste all 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.590
 events happen around you errand 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.090
 is heard literally on the go and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.060
 really hares text you can see who 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.970
 set on fire to supplement anyone required 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.910
 help habitual task will turn 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 script tapes such that every time on 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.030
 separate territories will 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.470
 occur independent 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.569
 random events and handle this 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.450
 task or not matter in the case 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.360
 failure events change the game world and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.230
 developing itself further though 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.870
 it is assumed that you are at it all the same 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.340
 affect for example stops a 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.959
 possible and cause 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.900
 new challenges arousing ancient evil 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.189
 because of greed 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.359
 there is still more modest personal 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.029
 stories of heroes who are elusive 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:43.479
 reminiscent of ideas and strategies 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.139
 Imagine you are creating a hero. 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.349
 just a card with the parameters of each 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.569
 its fate its past which is not 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.979
 again remind about yourself because the course below 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.229
 created asuras will be asked in which school 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.049
 how did the man end 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.609
 ask about the social situation 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.650
 a dozen soft keys occurred five times 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.680
 there are enough questions for one player 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 for a long time the question is only in their quality 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.079
 everything 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.079
 everything 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:19.899
 the troops 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.669
 the most obvious improvement knocked out 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.189
 the engine besides the glorious pictures will issue and 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.990
 a couple of real surprises 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.760
 rumor has it that the world is down to defeat 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.610
 will find unprecedented for the genre 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.990
 interactivity is possible but cannot 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.430
 use veb there are some that 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.880
 are within reach not 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.570
 speaking of throwing stools 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.810
 in a fight and diving on underwater chickens 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.810
 travel 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.289
 but what is already possible with confidence 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.909
 confirm medals letters design 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.509
 beautiful graphics you need to be able to 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:56.969
 cope and so far key stadium 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.009
 Vorskla as close to the pictures 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.869
 artists 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.639
 peculiar beauty endowed and 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.859
 hospitals perhaps the most conditional part 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.619
 any topic my victory on the amount of skills 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.369
 intel core2 goes into quality and it comes 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.480
 not only about balance 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.230
 just see what gets up 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.230
 ordinary less 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.899
 by the way if such a master leaves your 

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.199
 party at the crucial moment 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.360
 the game should automatically 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.830
 to equalize the balance of power under the new composition 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.519
 the most spectacular moment should be 

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.629
 battles one of the five ancient dragon 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.749
 and here the balance is likely and taking 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.749
 will not send 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.259
 agree to break the usual way 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.130
 Speech about a similar genre extremely courageous occupations 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.380
 and wherever you look but we 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.870
 drew attention to the guild wars 2 precisely because of 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.660
 non-standard way of thinking her 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.550
 developers 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.770
 wonderful voice characters random 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.530
 events and personal history of each 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.370
 we hope that until 2001 when it comes out 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.180
 game we hear from them many more 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.680
 interesting
