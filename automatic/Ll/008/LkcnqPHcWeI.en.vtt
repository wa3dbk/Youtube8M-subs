next<00:00:02.520> up<00:00:02.669> we<00:00:02.820> have<00:00:02.850> tabata<00:00:03.419> method<00:00:03.870> which<00:00:04.049> is

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
next up we have tabata method which is

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.559 
next up we have tabata method which is
just<00:00:04.680> repeated<00:00:05.130> work<00:00:05.310> intervals<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:06.120> intense

sprinting it can be squat thrusts with a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.500 
sprinting it can be squat thrusts with a
press<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.060> what<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
press which is what we're going to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.779 
press which is what we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> second<00:00:19.550> it<00:00:20.550> could<00:00:20.670> be

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
demonstrate in a second it could be

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.429 
demonstrate in a second it could be
power<00:00:21.180> cleans<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.779> could<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.960> anything<00:00:22.170> like

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
power cleans it could be anything like

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.230 
power cleans it could be anything like
that<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.130> use<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> weight<00:00:23.609> keep<00:00:24.090> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that just if you use a weight keep it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.210 
that just if you use a weight keep it
light<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> reasonable<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.500> maintain<00:00:25.859> form

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
light and reasonable to maintain form

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.269 
light and reasonable to maintain form
and<00:00:26.519> speed<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.750> idea<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.289> go<00:00:28.410> fast<00:00:28.800> for

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and speed the idea is to go fast for

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.400 
and speed the idea is to go fast for
each<00:00:29.580> session<00:00:29.910> we'll<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.720> doing<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
each session we'll be doing this on a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.740 
each session we'll be doing this on a
two<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.070> work<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.700> rest<00:00:32.940> ratio<00:00:33.450> which

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
two to one work to rest ratio which

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
two to one work to rest ratio which
we'll<00:00:33.960> be<00:00:34.079> doing<00:00:34.320> 20<00:00:34.649> seconds<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> work<00:00:35.100> 10

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
we'll be doing 20 seconds of work 10

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
we'll be doing 20 seconds of work 10
seconds<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> rest<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.110> he'll<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.010> Joby<00:00:38.520> moving

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
seconds of rest and he'll be Joby moving

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.369 
seconds of rest and he'll be Joby moving
as<00:00:38.850> fast<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:39.870> okay<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.230> your

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
as fast as you can it's okay if your

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
as fast as you can it's okay if your
speed<00:00:40.590> flows<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:40.980> at<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> end<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:42.390> whole

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
speed flows down at the end the whole

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.959 
speed flows down at the end the whole
idea<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.350> put<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:43.980> work

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
idea is just to put it in the most work

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
idea is just to put it in the most work
that<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.020> amount<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.350> time<00:00:46.410> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that you can in that amount of time so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770 
that you can in that amount of time so
to<00:00:47.250> keep<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> highest<00:00:47.700> work<00:00:48.210> level<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to keep the highest work level that you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.500 
to keep the highest work level that you
can<00:00:48.960> we'll<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:49.980> demonstrating<00:00:50.129> 3<00:00:50.760> set<00:00:50.969> 3<00:00:51.000> sets

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
can we'll be demonstrating 3 set 3 sets

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.920 
can we'll be demonstrating 3 set 3 sets
of<00:00:51.780> 20<00:00:52.379> seconds<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.890> 10<00:00:53.280> seconds<00:00:53.610> rest<00:00:53.930> during

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
of 20 seconds on 10 seconds rest during

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.720 
of 20 seconds on 10 seconds rest during
the<00:00:55.110> complexes<00:00:55.680> you'll<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.010> doing<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.309> six

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the complexes you'll be doing that six

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.049 
the complexes you'll be doing that six
times<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.239> possibly<00:00:57.780> eight<00:00:57.989> times<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.000> we

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
times or possibly eight times so here we

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
times or possibly eight times so here we
go<00:01:00.180> Joe<00:01:00.600> squat<00:01:00.930> thrusts<00:01:01.230> squat<00:01:01.440> thrusts<00:01:02.219> with

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:27.620 
like nothing the job keep it up in ten
seconds<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.709> stop<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.360> that'd<00:02:27.600> be

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630
