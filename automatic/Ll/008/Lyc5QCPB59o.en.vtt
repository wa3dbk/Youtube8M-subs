00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 the friends of these sown third pebbles 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.140
 video of the day I also wanted 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.750
 make you a little video today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.820
 of size because I have a small 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.230
 nice recipe we come back on 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.179
 custard so in fact I wanted you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.150
 do a little overview already 2d 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 custard so I wanted to do a little 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.160
 snap to radical help because 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.990
 I did some time ago already I 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 does his custard recipe and then I 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 have to say I'm pretty much appreciated this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.340
 recipe that you will find on his 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.260
 chain it is based on vanilla 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.700
 home capella de fringe star 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.110
 manila de g cracker mastiffs 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.329
 I put the cap and the wii so if I 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.379
 put that and then I put right away 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 that is all they advocate 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.489
 is exactly the trick so take 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.010
 for 9000 liters 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.210
 fabre you will go see her recipe she is 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.250
 very nice she is 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.690
 that said very different from the one I 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.329
 do right now so here you have I 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.820
 you still show yourself good mr 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.379
 that water star so mr custard to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.670
 sailboats this jar wanted you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.720
 still show the difference of 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.189
 maturation 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.140
 so if you want this recipe you 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.060
 see the previous video on 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.770
 the recipe here you have a liquid that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.650
 was done on May 27 you see the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.880
 color so he has not spip yet and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.479
 see we still have 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.619
 he's almost ten days old but hey hey he 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.009
 is not ten days what do I say 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.869
 it rained all seven or eight days so he 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.820
 sent he did not arrive at all 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.530
 maturation 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.600
 this one on the other hand starts to be not 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.820
 badly and you could have stopped me day 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 whistle because soot over 75 miles 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 and when I whistle already half 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 So this one about the two I was able to 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.799
 dated 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.399
 well he is well before he has to 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.439
 have teeth three weeks three 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.520
 weeks a month maybe even so 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.869
 here is always an excellent recipe 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 that I go daily 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.549
 my wife also from elsewhere 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.829
 see if you want to see her at 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.390
 the video on this recipe mr castard 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.319
 of water that is tomorrow in my chain 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.160
 today I wanted to talk to you about 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.670
 this recipe 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.480
 so this recipe so I found on 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.599
 an english forum I think I have not 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.430
 marked the dunes name the author let's say 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.989
 of this recipe 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.090
 so I blame myself a bit because I have 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.739
 still looted something without making it to 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.200
 its owner but I'm still 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.760
 you give it so it's a recipe for 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.730
 that start that is a little bit more 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.060
 complex even quite complex to do by 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.799
 compared to mine but who helps who 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.349
 is different mainly because 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:48.459
 of an aroma it's the rom motors coach that 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.880
 will give a taste of caramel candies in 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.090
 more to your custard so this is a 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.959
 custard caramelized 7 6 this is good 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.750
 I can tell you that she is really 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:04.000
 very very good I vapes is not bad 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.739
 on my iphone ds and i have to say that 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 we are really very good 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.340
 custard which is a bit different from 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.980
 the one I usually see and that 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.910
 I like it a lot as well 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.459
 she really has a little back 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.430
 especially at the expiration a small return 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.799
 caramel a little salty but still very 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.060
 creamy creamy so a good 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.720
 recipe anyway very nice you 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.069
 can test it 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.970
 I will introduce you to the aromas 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.900
 necessary so for ten thousand liters 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.970
 so I find you do not do all the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.799
 calculations because it's boring 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.540
 frankly but I give you both 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.959
 agents percent so for ten thousand 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.760
 liters 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.230
 you will start putting off gels 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.239
 heard we always have a base of 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.730
 vanilla the box star of home capella 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.319
 so you're going to put for 10,000 elytron 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 15% of this vanilla custard capella aroma 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:56.900
 of course you are going bad 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:01.340
 then 5% of french vanilla always 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:07.590
 from home thank you for the development 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:13.859
 why is not always way home capella 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:16.289
 so 5% of french vanilla then you 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.709
 go put 3% and that's what makes the 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.949
 caramel toffee taste a bit salty you 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.490
 go put 3% of coach putters 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.349
 schepper smoker apprentice so 3% 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.910
 only 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.780
 no more because if not really the 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.060
 caramel will prevail 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:39.419
 so you're even a bit less but good 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:44.190
 finally 3% 3% of which is 3% of 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:47.490
 bathurst coach you will put 2% of 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.090
 the magic room all ceded lecce that is 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.789
 really say they really have 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.389
 super finally that I like a lot that is 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.590
 the base 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.860
 finally kippa the base but who is there 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.820
 the magic ingredient of mike starr two 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.750
 main so you put 2% of this 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:10.889
 aroma there and then you end up 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.500
 about 1% and a half 1 % 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.490
 rather 1% of badly dating dating that I 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.300
 will not show you because he is 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.520
 in another box 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.880
 So here's a thoroughbred born team malton 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.690
 increasingly ie let's say three 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.729
 drops for 10 ml here I hope 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.630
 that the recipe is not too complicated if 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.370
 you have questions you me them 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.229
 ask in any case it is excellent 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.830
 question 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.830
 I will taste it 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.989
 so an excellent custard with 1 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.739
 very pleasant caramel almost a little 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:51.529
 dirty and very unctuous very very creamy 

00:05:48.739 --> 00:05:53.989
 and creamy really a good custard 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:56.719
 this is me I know it's morning 

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:58.369
 especially at breakfast with coffee etc 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.039
 it's really the liquid for me 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:02.899
 morning so here I leave you there 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.239
 on it I hope you have inspired 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:07.009
 and then I'll see you soon for 

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:09.550
 others this for other videos to
