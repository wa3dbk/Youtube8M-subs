paint

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
paint

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.090 
paint
yeah<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.989> black<00:00:58.710> sharpie

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
yeah well I think but black sharpie

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.360 
yeah well I think but black sharpie
works<00:00:59.309> better<00:00:59.579> because<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.570> dries<00:01:00.809> really

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
works better because it dries really

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.780 
works better because it dries really
quick<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.420> draw<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.589> boots<00:01:05.460> it

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
quick and then you draw like boots it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.719 
quick and then you draw like boots it
would<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.240> better<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.260> had<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.590> red<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
would be better if you had a red and a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
would be better if you had a red and a
