00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.160
 my second try now in mine 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 tutorial where I'll show you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.080
 Like her the top cap picker shader model 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.610
 stalins I can not do that well 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.059
 you pronounce you already know that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.199
 krejcik 13 shaders yes I think that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.880
 shader model actually very cool 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.289
 but now I still think better 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.279
 but I was still a tutorial 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.080
 do about it like the whole 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 works first and foremost 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.890
 team clean install it for it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.720
 it may be that you have a murder or a murder 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.220
 has installed or something with what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.660
 it is then incompatible again and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.130
 I start the number in my head 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.660
 drink the team because the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
 Minecraft server somehow completed 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 are and I want just you 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.030
 can log into the original 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.469
 I can give it a try 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.450
 her here go to options danfoss 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.980
 update property then and then a belief 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.539
 Just do not give me up because the servers 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.789
 are completed when stretched 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.320
 you just have to update here on force 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.980
 hard and then on entertain 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.539
 click 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.739
 Now you have to wait a bit to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.079
 I'm sorry I downloaded this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.699
 that it takes so long can be that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.399
 just anyone internet apps can too 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.359
 be that a team of servers lies 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.109
 because you are not right 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.270
 can log in 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.320
 so expect that has gone through this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.590
 is so far a fresh again 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 Minecraft have the same on it without mods 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.110
 is still a bit natural 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.280
 shit I do not have time anymore 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.070
 but only a little bit there 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.750
 I do not like them in 78 kilo 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.830
 prefer stone age or what 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 you know wait a bit 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 sometimes the servers are a bit 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.150
 overwhelmed overwhelmed so should now 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 one manages to start again this way 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.550
 let's just open it up again 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.440
 and what we do now I want as 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.869
 very first team forge down so 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.250
 The link to this will be in also in the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.710
 video description and there must be 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.600
 you just on download 1.5.2011 from 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.070
 and now you are still deep 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.970
 a download link is also available 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.220
 in the video description 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.869
 you also have to download 1.502 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.660
 click and then click here again 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.060
 download the whole store and 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.680
 Now we come to the shader model moment 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.910
 the link to this is also in the video 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 description his job is just too 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.680
 Click on download and then on it 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.770
 so also what we store now 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.080
 we make the windows key + he type 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.810
 1 percent from tata percent in this 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.000
 window press ok go in the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.280
 point minecraft folder then we give 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 the two folders then on the minecraft 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.000
 there we open a right click 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.730
 with winrar archive you need this 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.049
 also winrar and what we first of all 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.269
 make wilders take following 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.160
 meter in the bucket on the meter in 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.500
 folder once clicks on the words 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.200
 whereupon you press shift and 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.790
 remove at the same time then you go 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.610
 here on yes so the tenant and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.650
 deleted folder is now install 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.070
 as a very first minecraft 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.600
 Suggestions now so you open the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.459
 folder and has now had easy 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.370
 everything from the downloaded 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.209
 team fort archive here in move in 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.049
 the team 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.310
 then we click ok again and so 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.560
 Now you have to be fine 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.540
 installing with opti fine 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.200
 the whole thing does not work, I think 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.610
 at least 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.380
 and that should be all 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.970
 mark from the downloaded ob 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.730
 deep an archive and also in the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.909
 pull minecraft 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.769
 So everything is pure here and now 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.599
 you still the shader model is her with it 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.650
 the mystery will do the same right there 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.930
 you just have to be very short 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.049
 the watch oh and her one also needs 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.299
 the gl is or the tsl skull break the 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.069
 even so I have my very short 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.420
 I'll try what I have 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.440
 just a small cut to make pure 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.970
 We'll see each other again soon 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.160
 you also have to have it 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.040
 just definitely important to her 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.989
 have to open here on this folder 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.620
 then you go on the video cube spades 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.290
 then you go to fashion 15.2 retrievers 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.000
 hd you open that and there you have to 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.560
 just all these files and this one 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.260
 shader folder here in the pull 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.920
 team and the whole field so then 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.500
 Can you just do it all here 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.730
 shoot then you can team 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.079
 I start briefly held her only 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.310
 offended because of my ship 2 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.349
 are finished and I am not 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 someone can not log in now 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.140
 thinks the original but I have 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.269
 so start and now you have here 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.130
 if we go short option now 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.849
 then on shaders then you have to 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.010
 internal rain then finished and then 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.520
 then we'll just go in the world 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:28.270
 and i'm waiting and we should 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.250
 actually the city 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.139
 i am so stupid i am so stupid i have 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.090
 Of course something else forgotten that we 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.910
 Of course we still have the ap in the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.979
 moment is the aha 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.320
 ok I know where the cases where the error 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.880
 is not internal we close 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.080
 again my hobby I again 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.289
 I also made a mistake 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.039
 already made last video of course 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.690
 targeted we are going to percent about 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.599
 percentage point team and create 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.860
 a folder called shape ex and must 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.870
 Now we just have to do that again 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.410
 downloaded topic or again 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.599
 open monument in the folder 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.699
 then you have to either between three 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.870
 high light maybe i would just like you 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.400
 recommend the bad pc as well as 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.120
 or you can take in three or ultra 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.830
 open once 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.750
 and there I would have to harry so w 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.070
 this folder just in the shader 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.990
 Pull in the packs folder 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.360
 and then you can team again 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.980
 start as I said I'm allowed the luggage 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.240
 because only because the server is completed 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.770
 you are not a schoop 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.210
 logging in can prove so small 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.530
 then team starts again and now 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.850
 I also know what we wrong 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.220
 moments that we will now do here 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.590
 no signs we leave open 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.090
 tackle getting back into the world have 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.620
 no signs yet that is yes 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.920
 boring without shader now we go 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.480
 on options shaders and less bip off 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.910
 I know that this is all a bit 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.080
 complicated with this mod but if you can 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.980
 Once installed, you have it installed 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.710
 also fun with it 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.850
 and we already have the double jbod 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.170
 installed yes I know because you speak 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.790
 different but i can not do it well 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.350
 pronounce and yes you have here 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.270
 I do not know what just a few 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.000
 graphic error oh no that is exactly here 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.250
 like the water the water looks like this 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.080
 if you let them explode 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.140
 fix you have already nice that here 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.430
 shader in olver 30 fps with money if 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.990
 you already do not want to invest 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.820
 you already get that shader in there 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.470
 are one sees indeed been their 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.310
 shadow and when we now talk to 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.930
 ignite animals 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.390
 you also pull a few effects 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.250
 you do not see it right, but yes 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.450
 now you have the horny shader 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.620
 I would like to model myself again for 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.720
 the four now with a video 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.650
 to apologize 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.390
 Now she has the shader with her 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.430
 installed works great and me 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.020
 think it's cool and I have to say 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.670
 Thank you for watching the video 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.280
 chips and see you next time 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.930
 today with the comments at 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.290
 problems as well and in criticism also in 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:48.900
 the comments just that one too 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.680
 just constructive criticism please in the 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.180
 Write comments 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.010
 I'd even say thank you 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.010
 already until the next school year
