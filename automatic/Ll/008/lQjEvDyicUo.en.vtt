00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
I gotta get keys for this boat then back

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:23.280 
I gotta get keys for this boat then back
on<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.759> water

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.220 

anything<00:02:24.290> starting<00:02:24.650> up<00:02:24.740> from<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.070> man<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:27.110> is

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
anything starting up from here man do is

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.910 
anything starting up from here man do is
start<00:02:27.470> up<00:02:27.590> from<00:02:27.740> here<00:02:31.420> zero<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.510> start<00:02:32.660> up<00:02:32.990> that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
start up from here zero to start up that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:04:56.939 
start up from here zero to start up that
sounds<00:02:34.160> good

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:13.559 

Florina<00:04:57.949> grass

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.450 

it<00:05:14.569> has<00:05:14.659> reverse<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.289> not<00:05:15.830> not<00:05:16.250> this

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
it has reverse to not not this

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.930 
it has reverse to not not this
controller<00:05:17.319> it<00:05:18.319> has<00:05:18.349> a<00:05:18.949> hazardous<00:05:19.220> but<00:05:19.759> it's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
controller it has a hazardous but it's

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.390 
controller it has a hazardous but it's
not<00:05:20.120> it's<00:05:20.539> not<00:05:20.690> gradual<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.740> just<00:05:21.919> kicks<00:05:22.159> in

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
not it's not gradual it just kicks in

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.029 
not it's not gradual it just kicks in
and<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:23.210> only<00:05:23.360> does<00:05:23.569> it<00:05:23.629> just<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.379> know<00:05:24.409> spin

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
and it only does it just you know spin

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.309 
and it only does it just you know spin
the<00:05:25.159> prop<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.669> because<00:05:26.389> it's<00:05:26.569> too<00:05:26.690> fast

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
the prop and because it's too fast

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.520 
the prop and because it's too fast
my<00:05:28.310> last<00:05:28.490> controller<00:05:28.970> had<00:05:29.330> had<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:30.500> know

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
my last controller had had a you know

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.399 
my last controller had had a you know
gradual<00:05:31.340> reverse<00:05:31.750> work<00:05:32.750> really<00:05:32.990> well<00:05:33.199> but

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
gradual reverse work really well but

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.089 
gradual reverse work really well but
this<00:05:33.530> one<00:05:33.740> doesn't

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
this one doesn't

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.710 
this one doesn't
I<00:05:34.400> rarely<00:05:34.789> need<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.270> you<00:05:35.449> don't<00:05:35.479> need<00:05:35.659> it

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
I rarely need it you don't need it

00:05:35.720 --> 00:06:13.210 
I rarely need it you don't need it
anyway

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:24.450 

I<00:06:14.220> like<00:06:14.850> this<00:06:15.030> boat<00:06:15.270> man<00:06:15.480> that<00:06:15.630> night

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.840 

and<00:06:26.050> that's<00:06:30.190> not<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.280> feature<00:06:31.460> I<00:06:31.580> like<00:06:31.700> about

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
and that's not the feature I like about

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.580 
and that's not the feature I like about
this<00:06:32.060> controller<00:06:32.480> that's<00:06:33.140> my<00:06:33.260> last<00:06:33.410> one

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
this controller that's my last one

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.650 
this controller that's my last one
doesn't<00:06:33.860> have<00:06:33.890> is<00:06:34.190> it<00:06:35.000> doesn't<00:06:35.240> when<00:06:35.570> the

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
doesn't have is it doesn't when the

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.620 
doesn't have is it doesn't when the
battery<00:06:35.930> runs<00:06:36.020> out<00:06:36.400> it's<00:06:37.400> gradually<00:06:38.270> starts

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
battery runs out it's gradually starts

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.200 
battery runs out it's gradually starts
reducing<00:06:39.440> throttle<00:06:40.160> and<00:06:40.340> you<00:06:40.730> see<00:06:40.940> that<00:06:41.120> it

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
reducing throttle and you see that it

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.810 
reducing throttle and you see that it
starts<00:06:41.750> slowing<00:06:41.930> down<00:06:42.200> my<00:06:43.190> last<00:06:43.370> one<00:06:43.670> would

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
starts slowing down my last one would

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.220 
starts slowing down my last one would
just<00:06:43.850> cut<00:06:44.330> out<00:06:44.480> and<00:06:44.660> you<00:06:44.690> have<00:06:44.810> to<00:06:44.900> go<00:06:45.020> figure

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
just cut out and you have to go figure

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.670 
just cut out and you have to go figure
it<00:06:45.350> out

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.700 

that<00:06:48.680> was<00:06:48.830> annoying<00:06:49.070> me<00:06:49.250> a<00:06:49.370> lot<00:06:50.260> so<00:06:51.260> it's<00:06:51.380> this

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
that was annoying me a lot so it's this

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.600 
that was annoying me a lot so it's this
weighs<00:06:52.030> this<00:06:53.030> weighs<00:06:53.270> about<00:06:53.420> two<00:06:54.370> two<00:06:55.370> and<00:06:55.400> a

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
quarter pounds my last battery weighed

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.910 
quarter pounds my last battery weighed
uh<00:06:58.180> three<00:06:59.180> pounds<00:06:59.540> and<00:07:00.160> I<00:07:01.160> was<00:07:01.400> able<00:07:01.580> to<00:07:02.920> make

uh three pounds and I was able to make
this<00:07:04.100> boat<00:07:10.780> that<00:07:11.780> helps<00:07:12.050> handling<00:07:12.410> a<00:07:12.500> lot

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
this boat that helps handling a lot

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.130 
this boat that helps handling a lot
handle<00:07:13.580> so<00:07:13.820> much<00:07:13.970> better<00:07:16.300> so<00:07:17.300> next<00:07:17.480> thing<00:07:17.600> I

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
handle so much better so next thing I

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.940 
handle so much better so next thing I
gotta<00:07:18.470> do<00:07:18.650> is<00:07:19.240> water<00:07:20.240> cooling<00:07:20.630> plates<00:07:21.230> one

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 
gotta do is water cooling plates one

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.220 
gotta do is water cooling plates one
here<00:07:22.220> and<00:07:22.340> one<00:07:22.490> here<00:07:22.730> for<00:07:23.510> this<00:07:23.630> pack<00:07:23.870> and<00:07:23.900> try

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
here and one here for this pack and try

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.870 
here and one here for this pack and try
to<00:07:24.290> draw<00:07:24.470> some<00:07:24.680> of<00:07:24.800> this<00:07:24.860> heat<00:07:25.100> away<00:07:25.310> and<00:07:25.550> keep

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
to draw some of this heat away and keep

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.410 
to draw some of this heat away and keep
them<00:07:25.970> cooler<00:07:26.270> that's<00:07:27.200> it
