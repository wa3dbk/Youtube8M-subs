00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
moving right at the start of April like

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.630 
moving right at the start of April like
April<00:01:37.920> first<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.369> moving<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:40.400> leading<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.490> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
April first I'm moving and leading up to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.139 
April first I'm moving and leading up to
that<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:43.189> moving<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.670> taking

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that I have to be moving out and taking

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
that I have to be moving out and taking
care<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.810> junk<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.229> being<00:01:46.470> really

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
care of all this junk and being really

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.480 
care of all this junk and being really
busy<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.009> stuff<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:49.170> until<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.860> point<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
busy and stuff so up until that point I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
busy and stuff so up until that point I
think<00:01:50.579> updates<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.329> pretty<00:01:51.600> normal<00:01:52.259> but

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
think updates would pretty normal but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.749 
think updates would pretty normal but
then<00:01:53.189> updates<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.240> slow<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
then updates will slow down to be just a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.780 
then updates will slow down to be just a
couple<00:01:56.909> times<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.360> week<00:01:57.390> instead<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.670> every<00:01:59.670> day

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
couple times a week instead of every day

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.039 
couple times a week instead of every day
like<00:02:00.149> they<00:02:00.329> are<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.329> want<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
like they are right now but I I want to
