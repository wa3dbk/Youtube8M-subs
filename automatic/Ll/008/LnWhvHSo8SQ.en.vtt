at<00:00:19.080> Parsons<00:00:19.770> School<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.070> Design<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:22.070> in<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
at Parsons School of Design and in my I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.460 
at Parsons School of Design and in my I
think<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:24.600> towards<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.930> end<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.320> my

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
think it was towards the end of my

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.910 
think it was towards the end of my
junior<00:00:25.529> year<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.609> had<00:00:27.390> an<00:00:27.539> assignment<00:00:27.920> to

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
junior year I had an assignment to

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.690 
junior year I had an assignment to
create<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.939> tooth<00:00:30.150> fairy<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:32.189> could<00:00:32.399> use

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
create the tooth fairy and you could use

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.540 
create the tooth fairy and you could use
whatever<00:00:33.270> materials<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> wanted<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> went

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
whatever materials you wanted so I went

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970 
whatever materials you wanted so I went
home<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.730> night<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.690> couldn't<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
home that night and I couldn't think of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
home that night and I couldn't think of
anything<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.640> draw<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> didn't<00:00:39.870> really

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
anything to draw with I didn't really

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479 
anything to draw with I didn't really
want<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> use<00:00:40.350> colored<00:00:40.620> pencils<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> didn't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
want to use colored pencils and I didn't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.100 
want to use colored pencils and I didn't
really<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> paint<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> looked<00:00:42.960> around

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
really want to paint so I looked around

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.279 
really want to paint so I looked around
my<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.399> supply<00:00:44.850> box<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.539> find<00:00:45.690> something

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
my little supply box to find something

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.670 
my little supply box to find something
to<00:00:46.649> create<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.270> found<00:00:48.539> sculpey<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to create with and I found sculpey and I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
to create with and I found sculpey and I
don't<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.850> don't

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
don't know how it got there I don't

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.330 
don't know how it got there I don't
remember<00:00:51.329> buying<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
remember buying it I think it was one of

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.010 
remember buying it I think it was one of
those<00:00:53.460> random<00:00:53.699> supplies<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.539> mother<00:00:54.809> had

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
those random supplies that my mother had

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
those random supplies that my mother had
bought<00:00:55.199> years<00:00:55.530> ago<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> put

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
bought years ago and just kind of put

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.090 
bought years ago and just kind of put
around<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.109> thought<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> would<00:00:58.530> sculpt<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
around so I thought I would sculpt the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.689 
around so I thought I would sculpt the
tooth<00:00:59.309> fairy

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
tooth fairy

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.360 
tooth fairy
so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> stayed<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.719> night<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.890> sculpted

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so I stayed up all night and I sculpted

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.740 
so I stayed up all night and I sculpted
a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.699> tooth<00:01:02.850> fairy<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> brought<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.600> into

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
a little tooth fairy it brought it into

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
a little tooth fairy it brought it into
school<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.500> everybody<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.159> excited

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
school and everybody was really excited

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760 
school and everybody was really excited
and<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.240> had<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> great<00:01:06.869> time<00:01:07.080> making<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.710> thing

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and I had a great time making this thing

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
and I had a great time making this thing
and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.390> fell<00:01:09.600> apart<00:01:09.930> after<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and then it all fell apart after the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.260 
and then it all fell apart after the
critique<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> thought<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:12.030> right<00:01:12.180> I'm

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
critique so I thought all right I'm

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.510 
critique so I thought all right I'm
going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> investigate<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> make<00:01:14.340> these

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
going to investigate a way to make these

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.340 
going to investigate a way to make these
things<00:01:14.580> stay<00:01:15.150> together<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.750> perfect<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
things stay together and perfect a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.190 
things stay together and perfect a
technique<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> kept<00:01:18.000> working<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> working

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
technique so I kept working and working

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
technique so I kept working and working
at<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:20.040> never<00:01:20.430> stopped<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
at it and I actually never stopped and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
at it and I actually never stopped and
that's<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> started<00:01:22.500> doing<00:01:22.890> 3d

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that's how I started doing 3d

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.969 
that's how I started doing 3d
illustrations

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.980 

this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.180> figures<00:01:33.630> from<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this is one of the the figures from the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.069 
this is one of the the figures from the
bailout<00:01:34.380> piece<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:35.670> he<00:01:36.299> didn't<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.750> into

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
bailout piece but he didn't make it into

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
bailout piece but he didn't make it into
the<00:01:37.170> show<00:01:37.200> because<00:01:38.009> he<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.939> too

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the show because he was a little too

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.950 
the show because he was a little too
fragile<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:40.049> travel<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:42.270> falling<00:01:42.689> apart

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
fragile to travel this is falling apart

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:55.770 
fragile to travel this is falling apart
as<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.290> speak

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.560 

so<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> wire<00:01:57.530> armature<00:01:58.060> with<00:01:59.060> tinfoil

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
so this is a wire armature with tinfoil

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.170 
so this is a wire armature with tinfoil
on<00:01:59.750> top<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.380> then<00:02:00.680> super<00:02:01.160> sculpey<00:02:01.400> on<00:02:01.850> top<00:02:02.060> of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
on top and then super sculpey on top of

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.690 
on top and then super sculpey on top of
that<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.320> sculpted<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> right<00:02:04.340> form

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that and then sculpted to the right form

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.240 
that and then sculpted to the right form
baked<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.540> toaster<00:02:05.960> oven<00:02:06.040> painted<00:02:07.040> with

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
baked in the toaster oven painted with

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:19.870 
baked in the toaster oven painted with
oil<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.030> acrylic<00:02:17.709> I'd<00:02:18.709> say<00:02:18.980> he<00:02:19.190> probably<00:02:19.430> took

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
oil and acrylic I'd say he probably took

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.990 
oil and acrylic I'd say he probably took
me<00:02:20.080> from<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.739> wire<00:02:21.950> armature<00:02:22.400> until

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
me from the wire armature until

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.160 
me from the wire armature until
completely<00:02:23.680> finished<00:02:24.680> sculpting<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:33.020> is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
completely finished sculpting this is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.930 
completely finished sculpting this is
actually<00:02:33.500> my<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.220> my<00:02:34.280> favorite<00:02:34.730> tools

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
actually my one of my favorite tools

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.449 
actually my one of my favorite tools
because<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:35.750> with<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.920> tiny<00:02:37.190> push

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
because you can with just a tiny push

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.060 
because you can with just a tiny push
you<00:02:37.820> can<00:02:37.970> make<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.480> miniature<00:02:40.060> fingernail
