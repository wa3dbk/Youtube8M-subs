00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
was in the sands it's very comforting to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.799 
was in the sands it's very comforting to
me<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> war<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:51.059> were<00:00:51.120> there

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
me to think that war they were there

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.520 
me to think that war they were there
were<00:00:51.930> people<00:00:52.170> still<00:00:52.710> making<00:00:54.079> making<00:00:55.079> things

were people still making making things

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.619 
were people still making making things
like<00:00:55.800> pianos<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:57.530> everybody's<00:00:58.530> general

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
like pianos when everybody's general

like pianos when everybody's general
enjoyment<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.930> probably

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
enjoyment and I think it probably

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
enjoyment and I think it probably
resided<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> store<00:01:08.150> I<00:01:09.530> found<00:01:10.530> inside<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
resided in a store I found inside the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.230 
resided in a store I found inside the
the<00:01:11.880> stool<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.570> belongs<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:14.010> was

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
the stool that belongs to it it was

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.060 
the stool that belongs to it it was
glittery<00:01:15.560> five-pointed<00:01:16.560> stars<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.610> stick<00:01:17.909> on

exercise<00:01:20.070> books<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:21.860> remember<00:01:22.860> these<00:01:23.009> from<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
exercise books I remember these from the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.719 
exercise books I remember these from the
1950s<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:25.100> expect<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.570> 1960<00:01:27.570> they<00:01:27.810> were<00:01:27.869> old<00:01:28.170> hat

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
1950s I expect by 1960 they were old hat

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.249 
1950s I expect by 1960 they were old hat
so<00:01:30.890> there<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> very<00:01:33.000> gentle<00:01:33.810> kind<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so there we have a very gentle kind of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.090 
so there we have a very gentle kind of
school<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.490> doesn't<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
school because it doesn't have all the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.499 
school because it doesn't have all the
kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> graffiti<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:41.150> scratches<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.360> would

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
kind of graffiti and scratches you would

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
kind of graffiti and scratches you would
expect<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:44.299> spilling<00:01:45.299> zhan<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> lid

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
expect just spilling zhan the lid

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.440 
expect just spilling zhan the lid
removed<00:01:50.600> now<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.170> been

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
removed now I think it's been

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.940 
removed now I think it's been
extensively<00:01:54.450> refurbished<00:01:54.750> before<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.770> don't

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
extensively refurbished before I don't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.590 
extensively refurbished before I don't
you<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:57.440> somebody's<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:59.700> knew<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.180> damper

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you know somebody's we knew the damper

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.530 
you know somebody's we knew the damper
felts<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.619> nice<00:02:01.800> white<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.759> new

felts which are very nice white and new

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.219 
felts which are very nice white and new
looking

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
looking

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.020 
looking
I<00:02:05.270> suspect<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.450> been<00:02:06.720> restrung<00:02:08.030> probably

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I suspect it's been restrung probably

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.510 
I suspect it's been restrung probably
sometime<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:10.009> 1960s<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:16.340> keyboard<00:02:17.340> has

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
sometime in the 1960s the keyboard has

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.490 
sometime in the 1960s the keyboard has
been<00:02:17.790> related<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.690> new<00:02:19.560> basis<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.340> felts

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
been related with new basis and felts

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500 
been related with new basis and felts
I've<00:02:22.500> had<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.040> apart<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.760> cleaned<00:02:24.300> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I've had it all apart and cleaned it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.550 
I've had it all apart and cleaned it's
pretty<00:02:24.959> loosely<00:02:26.480> regulated<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.959> carefully

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
pretty loosely regulated it carefully

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.110 
pretty loosely regulated it carefully
and<00:02:29.280> I've<00:02:29.600> refinished<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.780> case<00:02:32.060> now<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and I've refinished the case now the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.340 
and I've refinished the case now the
case<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:35.540> English<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.140> suppose<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.239> 1944

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
case is like English I suppose in 1944

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.259 
case is like English I suppose in 1944
they<00:02:40.350> couldn't<00:02:40.769> get<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> more<00:02:41.310> exotic<00:02:41.670> kinds

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
they couldn't get the more exotic kinds

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.910 
they couldn't get the more exotic kinds
of<00:02:42.420> stuff<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.280> hopefully<00:02:45.920> vastly

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
of stuff which is hopefully vastly

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.640 
of stuff which is hopefully vastly
inferior<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.880> imagine<00:02:51.690> also<00:02:51.870> during<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
inferior and I imagine also during the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.319 
inferior and I imagine also during the
war<00:02:52.860> they<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.459> couldn't<00:02:53.850> get<00:02:54.000> French

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
war they they couldn't get French

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.020 
war they they couldn't get French
polishes<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.200> such<00:02:55.440> so<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.579> was<00:02:56.790> never

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
polishes and such so this was never

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.280 
polishes and such so this was never
French<00:02:57.420> polished<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:59.160> finished<00:02:59.670> with

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.860 

such<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.799> basic<00:03:03.519> sealer<00:03:03.849> and<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.689> wax<00:03:06.870> polish

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
such a basic sealer and and wax polish

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:18.300 
such a basic sealer and and wax polish
it<00:03:08.170> completely<00:03:08.739> myself<00:03:14.099> so<00:03:15.099> it's<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:18.010> become

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
it completely myself so it's it's become

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.080 
it completely myself so it's it's become
quite<00:03:18.760> expensive<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:24.010> now<00:03:24.280> owes<00:03:24.519> me<00:03:24.819> four

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
quite expensive it now owes me four

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.069 
quite expensive it now owes me four
thousand<00:03:25.599> pounds<00:03:26.049> already<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.329> hope

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.780 

sometimes<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.379> we'll<00:03:32.620> take<00:03:32.859> pity<00:03:33.099> on<00:03:33.250> me<00:03:33.579> and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
sometimes so we'll take pity on me and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:08:07.270 
sometimes so we'll take pity on me and
