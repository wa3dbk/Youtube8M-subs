that and I found that that is probably

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.040 
that and I found that that is probably
some<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> best<00:00:32.369> content<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.899> can

just<00:00:35.940> write<00:00:36.270> cut<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.840> moment<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
just write cut from the moment the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
just write cut from the moment the
problem<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.309> though<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.820> if

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.570 
call to action make sure that if you're
using<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.870> keyword<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.830> actually

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
using the keyword that you actually

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.940 
using the keyword that you actually
optimize<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:30.540> call<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.080> action<00:02:31.110> using<00:02:31.680> that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
optimize your call to action using that

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.700 
optimize your call to action using that
keyword<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.880> for<00:02:33.090> example<00:02:33.180> if<00:02:33.660> I'm<00:02:33.870> writing<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
keyword so for example if I'm writing a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.070 
keyword so for example if I'm writing a
blog<00:02:34.920> about<00:02:35.040> gun<00:02:35.760> control<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.720> I'm<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:37.020> to
