okay<00:00:02.370> guys<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:02.970> will<00:00:03.090> be<00:00:03.179> able<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.330> solve<00:00:03.570> a

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
okay guys this will be able to solve a

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.870 
okay guys this will be able to solve a
pair<00:00:04.110> minx<00:00:05.270> so<00:00:06.799> in<00:00:07.799> this<00:00:07.919> video<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.280> assume<00:00:08.670> you

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
pair minx so in this video I assume you

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.129 
pair minx so in this video I assume you
already<00:00:09.000> know<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> solve<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.809> three<00:00:09.990> by

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
already know how to solve it three by

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.310 
already know how to solve it three by
three<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.860> basic<00:00:11.340> notation<00:00:11.880> when<00:00:12.320> this

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
three and the basic notation when this

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.160 
three and the basic notation when this
is<00:00:13.500> our<00:00:13.650> little<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:14.670> few<00:00:16.130> i'll<00:00:17.840> see<00:00:19.939> so<00:00:21.170> let's

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
is our little all few i'll see so let's

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.970 
is our little all few i'll see so let's
get<00:00:22.350> started<00:00:23.150> what<00:00:24.150> i<00:00:24.180> usually<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.750> first<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.680> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
get started what i usually do first is I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.410 
get started what i usually do first is I
or<00:00:26.400> II<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.439> place<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.830> three

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
or II as I place these three

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.840 
or II as I place these three
centerpieces<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.830> beastly<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.640> i'll<00:00:32.759> start

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
centerpieces in beastly so i'll start

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.700 
centerpieces in beastly so i'll start
with<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> other<00:00:33.329> side<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.380> already<00:00:34.530> has

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
with the other side so it already has

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
with the other side so it already has
one<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.480> here's<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.770> here's<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.870> easy

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
one so here's one and here's one so easy

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
one so here's one and here's one so easy
thing<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> r<00:00:41.719> l<00:00:42.719> brain<00:00:44.690> next<00:00:45.690> step<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
thing to do is r l brain next step is to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.700 
thing to do is r l brain next step is to
orient<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> tips<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:49.320> match<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
orient the tips so just match up the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.630 
orient the tips so just match up the
colors

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.180 

like<00:00:53.329> now<00:00:54.050> all<00:00:54.200> I<00:00:54.230> have<00:00:54.380> to<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:54.590> is<00:00:54.739> placing

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
like now all I have to do is placing

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.160 
like now all I have to do is placing
these<00:00:55.430> i<00:00:56.290> like<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.379> call<00:00:57.530> eggs<00:00:57.860> flocks<00:00:58.280> cuz<00:00:58.640> i

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
these i like to call eggs flocks cuz i

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.729 
these i like to call eggs flocks cuz i
don't<00:01:00.170> know<00:01:00.260> just<00:01:00.530> like<00:01:01.129> to<00:01:01.989> see<00:01:02.989> here's<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
don't know just like to see here's the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.609 
don't know just like to see here's the
yellow<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.790> blue<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:05.690> your<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.140> yellow<00:01:06.409> and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
yellow and blue and your the yellow and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.590 
yellow and blue and your the yellow and
blue<00:01:06.830> slot<00:01:07.990> for<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.140> case<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:09.920> have<00:01:10.310> to<00:01:10.580> do<00:01:10.759> we

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
blue slot for this case we have to do we

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.320 
blue slot for this case we have to do we
have<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.750> remove<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.380> up<00:01:12.880> like<00:01:13.880> our<00:01:14.530> then<00:01:15.530> L

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
have to remove this up like our then L

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.600 
have to remove this up like our then L
does<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:17.479> put<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:18.170> right<00:01:18.320> there<00:01:18.610> then

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
does that put that right there then

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.340 
does that put that right there then
our<00:01:19.909> prime<00:01:20.420> then<00:01:21.229> out<00:01:21.770> front<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:23.390> see<00:01:23.659> we<00:01:24.140> just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
our prime then out front and see we just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.960 
our prime then out front and see we just
got<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:25.119> edge<00:01:26.119> slot<00:01:26.780> build<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.789> now<00:01:28.789> we're

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
got that edge slot build it now we're

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.660 
got that edge slot build it now we're
time<00:01:29.149> for<00:01:29.300> them<00:01:29.420> actually<00:01:29.590> here's<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.680> orange

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
time for them actually here's the orange

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.410 
time for them actually here's the orange
and<00:01:31.880> yellow<00:01:32.410> orange<00:01:33.410> in<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.590> lot<00:01:34.060> now<00:01:35.060> we<00:01:35.119> can't

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
and yellow orange in a lot now we can't

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.120 
and yellow orange in a lot now we can't
do<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.660> same<00:01:35.869> one<00:01:36.020> as<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.830> one<00:01:37.130> goes<00:01:38.050> see<00:01:39.130> its

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
do the same one as this one goes see its

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.770 
do the same one as this one goes see its
flipped<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.300> we<00:01:41.509> gotta<00:01:42.610> do<00:01:43.610> another<00:01:43.759> one<00:01:44.179> what

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
flipped so we gotta do another one what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.460 
flipped so we gotta do another one what
we<00:01:44.899> do<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.350> do<00:01:45.470> art<00:01:45.950> prime<00:01:46.429> and<00:01:47.830> up<00:01:48.830> prime

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
we do is we do art prime and up prime

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.020 
we do is we do art prime and up prime
right<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.310> up

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
right and up

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.410 
right and up
no<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.440> filled<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.210> now<00:01:57.210> it's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
no see we just filled that in now it's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.039 
no see we just filled that in now it's
time<00:01:57.720> for<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:57.990> last<00:01:58.260> one<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:59.720> green<00:02:00.720> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
time for the last one the green and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
time for the last one the green and
yellow<00:02:01.790> is<00:02:02.790> right<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.979> now<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.220> just<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
yellow is right here now we can just do

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.320 
yellow is right here now we can just do
the<00:02:05.640> same<00:02:05.820> cases<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> yellow<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.110> blue

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
the same cases for the yellow and blue

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.920 
the same cases for the yellow and blue
dl<00:02:09.709> are<00:02:10.709> prime<00:02:11.190> L<00:02:11.880> Prime<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:14.120> now<00:02:15.120> since<00:02:15.750> we

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
dl are prime L Prime and now since we

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.170 
dl are prime L Prime and now since we
have<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.350> whole<00:02:17.069> first<00:02:17.610> layer<00:02:18.980> solved<00:02:20.180> time

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
have this whole first layer solved time

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.550 
have this whole first layer solved time
to<00:02:21.330> flip<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.810> over<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.050> do<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.709> second<00:02:23.489> layer

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
to flip it over and do the second layer

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.410 
to flip it over and do the second layer
well<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> lucky<00:02:26.610> salt<00:02:26.850> because<00:02:27.060> i

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
well see this is a lucky salt because i

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.710 
well see this is a lucky salt because i
already<00:02:27.510> had<00:02:27.750> already<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.040> entire

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
already had already got this entire

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.770 
already had already got this entire
we're<00:02:30.720> solving<00:02:31.019> Oh<00:02:31.140> ever<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.500> do<00:02:31.830> with<00:02:31.980> that

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
we're solving Oh ever to do with that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.479 
we're solving Oh ever to do with that
but<00:02:33.780> there<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.260> some<00:02:34.440> cases<00:02:34.769> where<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.850> have<00:02:36.390> to

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
but there are some cases where I have to

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.890 
but there are some cases where I have to
sit<00:02:38.489> around<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.030> edges<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:42.360> so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
sit around the edges like this and so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080 
sit around the edges like this and so
what<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.800> do<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.310> find<00:02:44.580> an<00:02:44.670> edge<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.819> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
what you do is you find an edge that you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.130 
what you do is you find an edge that you
want<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.300> move<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.959> i'll<00:02:46.140> move<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:47.100> here

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
want to move so i'll move this one here

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.680 
want to move so i'll move this one here
and<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.380> for<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:50.250> I'll<00:02:50.580> do<00:02:50.910> L<00:02:52.160> R<00:02:53.160> prime<00:02:53.690> L

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and so for this one I'll do L R prime L

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.310 
and so for this one I'll do L R prime L
prime<00:02:55.250> art<00:02:56.250> Prime<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.269> C<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.110> move<00:02:58.290> that

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
prime art Prime and C we just move that

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.140 
prime art Prime and C we just move that
one<00:02:58.620> there<00:02:58.769> but<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.010> slipped<00:02:59.310> over<00:02:59.489> but<00:02:59.760> we'll

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
one there but I slipped over but we'll

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.690 
one there but I slipped over but we'll
get<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.660> later<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.430> now<00:03:02.430> we're<00:03:02.579> going

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
get on to that later and now we're going

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.870 
get on to that later and now we're going
to<00:03:02.790> move<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.360> one<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:04.459> now<00:03:05.459> whenever<00:03:05.670> you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
to move this one here now whenever you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.090 
to move this one here now whenever you
do<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.269> slot<00:03:06.630> or<00:03:06.959> whatever<00:03:07.709> you're<00:03:07.829> doing

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
do this slot or whatever you're doing

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.699 
do this slot or whatever you're doing
switching<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> last<00:03:09.060> two<00:03:09.299> I<00:03:09.570> already<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.560> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
switching the last two I already do the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.430 
switching the last two I already do the
opposing<00:03:11.280> sides<00:03:11.549> like<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.019> move<00:03:13.200> this

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
opposing sides like so I just move this

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.370 
opposing sides like so I just move this
one<00:03:13.739> up<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:14.970> I<00:03:15.299> would<00:03:15.450> move<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.810> one<00:03:15.989> down

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
one up then I would move this one down

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.650 
one up then I would move this one down
like<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:17.489> see

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
like that see

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.620 
like that see
and<00:03:19.750> L<00:03:20.590> are<00:03:22.710> out<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.760> see<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.300> move<00:03:25.510> them

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
and L are out and see you just move them

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.790 
and L are out and see you just move them
around<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.930> got<00:03:26.050> in<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.170> right<00:03:26.290> place<00:03:26.530> and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
around and got in the right place and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.090 
around and got in the right place and
now<00:03:26.980> very<00:03:27.760> sometimes<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:29.350> case<00:03:29.530> where<00:03:29.830> these

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
now very sometimes the case where these

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.170 
now very sometimes the case where these
two<00:03:30.520> or<00:03:30.760> flipped<00:03:31.060> over<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:32.790> try<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.850> flip<00:03:34.000> over

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
two or flipped over and try to flip over

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.790 
two or flipped over and try to flip over
so<00:03:35.130> what<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.160> do<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:37.150> do<00:03:37.210> our<00:03:37.870> prime<00:03:39.330> up<00:03:40.800> out

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
so what I do is I do our prime up out

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.520 
so what I do is I do our prime up out
Prime<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.760> see<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.270> flip<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.630> over<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.080> we

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
Prime and see that flip it over so we

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.220 
Prime and see that flip it over so we
got<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.740> flip<00:03:44.860> over<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.310> other<00:03:45.550> one<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:47.200> I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
got to flip over the other one and so I

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
got to flip over the other one and so I
do<00:03:47.380> up<00:03:48.280> prime<00:03:48.730> there's<00:03:49.360> that<00:03:49.660> one<00:03:50.220> then<00:03:51.220> I'll

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
do up prime there's that one then I'll

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.370 
do up prime there's that one then I'll
then<00:03:54.510> up<00:03:55.510> prime<00:03:56.520> R<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:58.450> C<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:59.020> flip<00:03:59.230> that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
then up prime R and C just flip that

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.650 
then up prime R and C just flip that
over<00:03:59.610> now<00:04:00.610> if<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.850> do<00:04:00.970> this<00:04:01.090> matram<00:04:01.920> and

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
over now if you do this matram and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.750 
over now if you do this matram and
that's<00:04:04.660> pretty<00:04:05.110> much<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:05.950> solving<00:04:06.670> up

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
that's pretty much it for solving up

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.160 
that's pretty much it for solving up
your<00:04:06.940> meters<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> there<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.130> go
