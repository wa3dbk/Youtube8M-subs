00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.790
 hello today we will connect with you 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.800
 these are the open waves 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.009
 number of loops horizontally 18 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.610
 rapport pattern in height 4 rows here 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.939
 knit 2 rapport horizontally here 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.169
 so he shares 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.189
 for the sample we type any number 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.259
 multiple 18 + 2 edge loops 1 row 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.099
 edge trim and knit all the loops 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.099
 facial 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.050
 and so knit until the end of row 2 row knit 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.769
 all purl loops 3 row of pattern 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.769
 edge remove 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.309
 then knit 2 together with the front 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.769
 tilt to the left and so we repeat two more 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.059
 we should have 3 times in total 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:06.509
 down 123 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.659
 then do a nakid and knit one 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:18.060
 we should have a facial total of 6 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:20.399
 pairs one pair of facial caps 2 3 4 5 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.300
 nakid the front 6 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.789
 then knit 3 down three times 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:36.179
 knit 2 together with the front tilt 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:40.890
 left 1 2 3 horizontal repeat pattern 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:46.619
 connected then continue first doing 3 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.039
 down slots 2 3 then six 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:54.660
 just do a nakid and a front loop nakid 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:02:00.509
 front 1 cap front 2 cap front 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:05.069
 3 nakid the front 4 5 and the last sixth 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.310
 times then knit 3 times 2 together 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.310
 facial 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.080
 123 and edge purl 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:26.799
 fourth row knit on pattern nakida 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.110
 knit purl loops knitting 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.019
 fourth row we tied the whole rapport 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.680
 patterns are such openwork waves with us 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.680
 it turns out
