showing<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.600> how<00:00:06.689> to<00:00:06.810> remove<00:00:07.020> memory<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.649> how

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
showing you how to remove memory and how

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.009 
showing you how to remove memory and how
to<00:00:08.010> reinstall<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.520> first<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.750> want<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.930> make

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
to reinstall it first we want to make

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.119 
to reinstall it first we want to make
sure<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> computer<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.680> turned<00:00:10.860> completely

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:11.129 
sure the computer is turned completely

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.299 
sure the computer is turned completely
off<00:00:11.520> then<00:00:12.510> we<00:00:12.629> want<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.039> disconnect<00:00:14.039> all<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
off then we want to disconnect all the

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.369

peripherals<00:00:22.670> next<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:23.880> remove<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> side

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
peripherals next we will remove the side

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.490 
peripherals next we will remove the side
panel<00:00:26.539> by<00:00:27.539> removing<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> two<00:00:28.080> screws<00:00:28.110> at<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
panel by removing the two screws at the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.850

back<00:00:29.840> slide<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:30.990> side<00:00:31.170> panel<00:00:31.470> off<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
back slide up the side panel off and

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.880 
back slide up the side panel off and
lift<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:34.199> put<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.469> off<00:00:34.589> to<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> side

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.110 

now<00:00:37.890> after<00:00:38.159> we<00:00:38.219> remove<00:00:38.429> the<00:00:38.519> side<00:00:38.699> panel<00:00:38.730> we

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
now after we remove the side panel we

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.489 
now after we remove the side panel we
want<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.539> sure<00:00:39.659> that<00:00:39.929> we<00:00:40.379> don't

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:40.499 
want to make sure that we don't

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.979 
want to make sure that we don't
discharge<00:00:41.159> any<00:00:41.339> static<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> case<00:00:42.149> an

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
discharge any static into the case an

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.340 
discharge any static into the case an
ESD<00:00:43.409> strap<00:00:43.469> such<00:00:43.979> as<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:45.229> touching<00:00:46.229> any

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
ESD strap such as this or touching any

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.779 
ESD strap such as this or touching any
piece<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.589> grounded<00:00:47.010> metal<00:00:47.129> should<00:00:47.519> do<00:00:47.699> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
piece of grounded metal should do the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.399 
piece of grounded metal should do the
trick<00:00:48.089> so<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:48.690> discharge<00:00:49.079> static

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
trick so that you don't discharge static

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:52.669 
trick so that you don't discharge static
into<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.679> case<00:00:49.999> now<00:00:50.999> now<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.260> locate

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:52.679 
into the case now now we want to locate

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.369 
into the case now now we want to locate
the<00:00:52.949> memory<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.429> the<00:00:53.940> motherboard<00:00:54.379> most

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the memory on the motherboard most

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.899 
the memory on the motherboard most
motherboards<00:00:55.679> it's<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.249> the<00:00:56.339> right<00:00:56.519> of<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
motherboards it's to the right of the

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.569 
motherboards it's to the right of the
processor<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:58.499> force<00:00:58.799> for<00:00:59.309> slots

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
processor and there's force for slots

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.239 
processor and there's force for slots
and<00:00:59.909> each<00:01:00.780> slot<00:01:00.839> has<00:01:01.229> two<00:01:01.739> retaining<00:01:02.100> clips

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
and each slot has two retaining clips

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.090 
and each slot has two retaining clips
one<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.819> the<00:01:02.879> top<00:01:03.089> one<00:01:03.569> on<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> bottom<00:01:04.010> what<00:01:05.010> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
one on the top one on the bottom what we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
one on the top one on the bottom what we
want<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.090> open<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> clip<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
want to do is open up the clip on the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.179 
want to do is open up the clip on the
bottom<00:01:08.030> then<00:01:09.030> open<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> clip<00:01:09.509> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.899> top<00:01:10.189> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
bottom then open the clip on the top and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.399 
bottom then open the clip on the top and
pull<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> memory<00:01:11.820> straight<00:01:12.149> out<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> same

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
pull the memory straight out do the same

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
pull the memory straight out do the same
thing<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> other<00:01:13.950> stick<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:18.200> lay<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.289> off

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
thing for the other stick and lay it off

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.459 
thing for the other stick and lay it off
to<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> side<00:01:20.210> now<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.240> put<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> memory<00:01:22.200> back

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
to the side now to put the memory back

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.170 
to the side now to put the memory back
in<00:01:22.649> it's<00:01:23.219> basically<00:01:23.549> reverse<00:01:23.789> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> same

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
in it's basically reverse of the same

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020 
in it's basically reverse of the same
process<00:01:24.649> we<00:01:25.649> lie<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.859> the<00:01:25.950> memory<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.909> just

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
process we lie on the memory up to just

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.429 
process we lie on the memory up to just
a<00:01:27.119> lot<00:01:28.850> we're<00:01:29.850> gonna<00:01:29.969> push<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.450> over<00:01:31.409> here

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
