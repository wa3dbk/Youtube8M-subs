so we can go ahead and do the inventory
and<00:02:54.129> let's<00:02:55.129> find<00:02:55.989> Wireless<00:02:56.989> cards<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.590> we

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
and let's find Wireless cards there we

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.319 
and let's find Wireless cards there we
are<00:02:57.709> how<00:02:58.129> about<00:02:58.220> we<00:02:58.609> get<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.819> hundred<00:02:59.150> and

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
are how about we get a hundred and

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.190 
are how about we get a hundred and
eleven<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.870> them<00:02:59.989> seems<00:03:00.829> legit<00:03:01.280> right<00:03:02.200> let's

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
eleven of them seems legit right let's

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.979 
eleven of them seems legit right let's
go<00:03:03.319> ahead<00:03:03.439> and<00:03:03.530> make<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.769> stack<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.280> 64<00:03:05.209> there

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
go ahead and make it a stack of 64 there

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.690 
go ahead and make it a stack of 64 there
we<00:03:06.079> go<00:03:06.200> okay<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.650> now<00:03:06.920> if<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.129> go<00:03:07.310> up<00:03:07.459> into<00:03:07.579> the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
we go okay so now if I go up into the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.520 
we go okay so now if I go up into the
wireless<00:03:07.879> terminal<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.930> drop<00:03:09.230> one<00:03:09.439> in

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
wireless terminal and I drop one in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.039 
wireless terminal and I drop one in
there<00:03:09.680> look<00:03:09.829> what<00:03:09.950> happens<00:03:10.389> it's<00:03:11.389> using<00:03:11.810> two

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
there look what happens it's using two

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.750 
there look what happens it's using two
more<00:03:12.260> RF<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.650> tick<00:03:12.889> but<00:03:13.129> it's<00:03:13.250> only<00:03:13.400> going<00:03:13.639> one

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
more RF to tick but it's only going one

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.059 
more RF to tick but it's only going one
extra<00:03:14.450> meter<00:03:14.659> so<00:03:15.200> there's<00:03:15.319> another<00:03:15.739> one<00:03:15.920> it's

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
extra meter so there's another one it's

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.909 
extra meter so there's another one it's
18.8<00:03:16.849> 20<00:03:17.359> RF<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.629> tick<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.410> can<00:03:18.560> see<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.799> you

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
18.8 20 RF a tick and you can see it you

charger and stick it in there and now
look<00:04:18.409> see<00:04:18.709> it's<00:04:19.310> got<00:04:19.699> stored<00:04:20.269> energy<00:04:21.010> 47<00:04:22.010> K<00:04:22.219> AE

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
look see it's got stored energy 47 K AE

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.839 
look see it's got stored energy 47 K AE
energy<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:23.719> it's<00:04:24.200> at<00:04:24.349> three<00:04:24.620> point<00:04:24.860> five<00:04:25.070> six

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
energy and it's at three point five six

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.550 
energy and it's at three point five six
percent<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:26.419> you<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.630> let<00:04:26.779> it<00:04:26.900> go

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
percent so you just let it go

percent so you just let it go
we<00:04:28.560> let<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:29.009> go<00:04:29.160> let<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.090> go<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.780> little<00:04:30.900> frozen

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
we let it go let it go a little frozen

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
and that'll charge to 100% and that is

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.330 
and that'll charge to 100% and that is
how<00:04:34.470> my<00:04:35.220> friends<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.699> move<00:04:35.849> to<00:04:36.030> an<00:04:36.120> era<00:04:36.360> you
