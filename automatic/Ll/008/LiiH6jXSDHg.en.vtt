 There are angels flying in this place in 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 people on the top come back up being in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.830
 all directions 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.640
 I do not know if the church has risen or if the heaven of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 your 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 I only know that it is full of angels of God. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.380
 believes in the existence of the angels we 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 I believe that Jesus taught this great 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.160
 true where he was in Galilee and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 came to him a young man named natanael 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.379
 natanael who had criticized jesus 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.329
 when Felipe was saying to that natanael 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.270
 must find the Messiah 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.370
 natanael replied to see her in the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.879
 Galilee may come out something that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 Do not be sad, Jesus. 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.350
 but he approached natanael he loved him 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 said natanael I know you I 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.060
 I know you leave that moment when 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.210
 You were born I saw that you were now. 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.009
 a little under a fig tree natanel 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 was thrilled and surprised 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.549
 Jesus, but how do you know all this? 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 me 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.860
 jesus replied you are surprised 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.850
 Natanael because I said I saw you.

 of man when Jesus came to this world 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.850
 he approached heaven from the earth and the earth from 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.240
 Heaven there is no more separation between the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.700
