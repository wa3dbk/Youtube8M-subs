00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.850
 Korean TV products are coming from the US 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.850
 How will that work? 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.130
 Recently bought a tv is johangyu cot at time of approx US 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.029
 I bought a TV and I was lost for 10 days and 9 years old. 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.930
 The tip of a famous company in Korea is yes 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:29.710
 Instead, it's an entry-level model that does not circulate domestically. 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:35.710
 The function is a little low, but at a low price. 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:39.010
 Cheaper by 70 won from burnt houses in our offshore mall's Korea 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.510
 TV prices seem to be low even for domestic distributors 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.800
 If you order, you can get goods to Korea through the shipping company. 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.070
 I say. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.930
 More and more people are buying repeat products directly from overseas. 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:56.680
 Then I looked to the Customs 55 does to the country products rather than foreign products 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.430
 It's the most popular example of a diameter exceeding 50 Beach mother at 05:00 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 You 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.899
 Even bigger and bigger food mug 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.010
 I was told that 30 TVs are coming in right now. 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.190
 The kkophideon tv exports rather than being a sort of filial products imported 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.190
 Will 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.350
 How much difference does domestic online price and overseas shopping mall price make? 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.160
 I'll try searching. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.570
 Example : a company's 55-inch TV 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.010
 Even if we added the tariff for shipping, there was a difference in edge price of about 1.1 million won . 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.640
 After'm saying 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.140
 This time , the product of the b company also buy the overseas shopping mall, 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.300
 I was able. 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 There are a lot of people who want to buy Korean products at overseas shopping malls. 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.090
 The shipper will not be able to ship any more orders 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.720
 But as the duration is a little different and some parts are different , 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.750
 I do. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.750
 on 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.110
 won 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.780
 In order to choose and define overseas to compete because they can market themselves 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:03.360
 Is it because the brand is so narrow? 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 The book also manufacturing its prices to a level which might accept that consumers receive 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.220
 South Korea TV stuff that bones can not gatgoyo will receive the current year 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.220
 The rain's in Korea
