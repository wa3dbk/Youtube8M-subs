00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.940
 in a stove wanted that commenting today 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.470
 I bring you a gameplay of caudé to advance 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.850
 we will rest a little after 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.349
 everything that has come out of whites 3 like 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.519
 you know yesterday you had three videos like this 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.780
 I recommend country through the channel 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.789
 last three videos are talking 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.070
 basically about 3 targets should not be 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.510
 a gameplay another one of them is a one 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.160
 full analysis of the trailer no 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.590
 you need big mind the truth feel 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.390
 long detailed one hundred percent and I 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.010
 I also raised a topic of activity 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.750
 ps4 also talking about that they are going to put 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.340
 the old games in x force one 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.810
 so it 's interesting that the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.740
 three videos if you want to know a little bit 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.510
 more about all the news that has 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.460
 occurred in during the e3 reflecta call of 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.719
 duty not so then today it's our turn 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.730
 have the title a revision that my 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.800
 country or I'm asking from the 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.300
 start of the game and something that I am not 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.859
 a lot of playing sniper well 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.420
 apart that I did not have this sniper wanted 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.309
 do a review about him but never 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.050
 I had gotten the bug for taking out 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.149
 one involved in it and analyze it and that's not 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.129
 so, well, here we have the mort 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.659
 doctor doctor, so, well, well, 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.579
 let's put the template template 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.109
 up right if you think it's good 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.539
 Well, as you are watching, he goes up two 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.370
 points of cadence will low you good up 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.809
 also a handling point lowers a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.120
 point of precision one point of damage and one 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.020
 point of mobility no and good a priori 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.880
 your car if this template 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.829
 then go if it is a sniper that is going to 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.020
 lower the damage will do martín marquez 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.030
 than the original so maybe I do not 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.549
 it's worth it and you really are 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.679
 quite wrong though the Moors and 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.509
 also the pass in the atlas the sniper 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.979
 Even if I put him down or up 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.630
 damage for example we have on the other side 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.030
 to serve is also worth elite not 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.009
 delmore I do not mean it and it's going to make you 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.569
 exactly the same as markers that the 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.390
 mold doctor why then because 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.890
 practically the multipliers good 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.420
 the sniper you know has a fixed damage 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.979
 and it depends on what body part you 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.409
 demos has a multiplier or another no 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.090
 then it goes up a little bit 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.189
 multipliers but not enough as 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.689
 to make different hits markers is 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.179
 say now when we rebel those 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.039
 two reals so let's see what 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.420
 parts of the body makes hit marker and in 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.619
 which ones not in which ones should I kill from a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.899
 shot does not depend a little bit so you 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.270
 you stay on the side of the game that gives some 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.770
 I fail not, but it is how it should be like 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.469
 I'll tell you so I think 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 let's go with the template good by 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.549
 certain example of funds when we come 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.629
 of another obviously on the terras map 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.250
 and the truth that I liked before the 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:08.959
 gameplay is a very decent ep to play 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.220
 sniper loose I am very bad like that 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.140
 that I hope you mole I'm doing for 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.360
 some other pointed some quick 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.440
 very messing with the flags obviously 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.330
 I can not play like that with ruth 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.340
 other weapons but good I think it's 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 pretty good so well come on 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.700
 There's a bullet's charge, you're already 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 seeing or is it a sniper that has 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.640
 let's say infinite charger 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.350
 shoot the bullet put the bolt with the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 bullet shot locks the mind to the game the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.850
 bullet and you're asking me 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.740
 how much good it takes to put that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.030
 that bolt is not what is important 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.190
 Well, as you know, the doctor has 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.340
 two points decline this makes 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.900
 then the cadence goes up a bit and passes 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.220
 to be 50 and one bullets per minute is the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.750
 speed at which we would be 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.370
 firing the must from the while during a 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.430
 minute are the bullets that we would throw 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.200
 say in 60 seconds would give us time to 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.030
 throw 51 bullets so you can understand me 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.400
 it's worth non-stop shooting so the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.810
 cadence as long as they are sniper you 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.430
 bolt it is very good for you to have 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.260
 more cadence to be able to take out clips or 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.209
 to be able to shoot faster if 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.269
 several enemies not then we have also 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.920
 the issue of increasing management 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.390
 it decreases the time it takes 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.100
 get up the sniper after clicking 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.920
 6 when you are not able to shoot I do not know 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.090
 what do you want the advantage of a howes to not 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.860
 I know what the roller coaster will be called 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.690
 then this driver gets up more 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.740
 normal fast rises with 0 with 27 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.570
 seconds 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.730
 all point so good like us 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.350
 extra time itself but they do not affect these 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.910
 birds so I do not want to talk about it the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.620
 Movement speed is a bit lower 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.310
 at the original speed that the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.600
 sniper you move to 88 2% of 100% of 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.770
 the very doll so you understand me 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.150
 one hundred percent is when you go with a 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.850
 speed SMG hundred vouchers 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.850
 hundred and the damage it has then is 98 that 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.130
 happens with 698 that we continue in the lead or in 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.050
 chest and stomach we are going to kill a 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.820
 shot in arms and legs in principle not 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.250
 then we do give it to the stomach 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.620
 head good in head is 1.5 which is 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.630
 enough to burst him not and if 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.460
 we give him in chest or stomach we're going 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.950
 to remove also hundred and something so 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.780
 We would kill not have arms and legs 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.400
 damage multiplier so it is 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.750
 Obvious that the sniper will make you hit 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.860
 marker there are many question me 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.030
 afterwards and people who shot him in the 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.280
 chest and by action marker 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.360
 surely it's because like the other 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.710
 enemy has the gun raised not 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.450
 because he is running because he is 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.740
 pointing t equal to breastfeeding 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.690
 based on the arm they touch them in the arm 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.400
 and that counts as impact on the arm and 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.600
 does not kill not so sometimes it happens and then 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.430
 is well over to the terror of all that 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.350
 prisoner is how it should be this mode is 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.180
 of the best more yes but sincerely 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.820
 I think it's not the best there is another that is 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.590
 better that is called fight in my opinion 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.360
 because the issue of mobility and all that 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.740
 that intervenes but I think it is 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.690
 pretty good the truth are the best 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.950
 of the game to see if they improve it this is 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.360
 to make this video so they improved the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.800
 moors because they said they would improve what 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.510
 said michael condrey but for now 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.040
 it seems that they have not touched it so I've 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.810
 said then I'm going to upload it already and when 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.250
 touch the sniper, we'll talk about 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 it does not but I do not know if they are going to touch it 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.180
 too much there is no for example you see that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.980
 wisco that I put in the click while 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.330
 it takes the pretty cool flag so 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.890
 Well, nothing more kids, I hope it's 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.420
 like this review tell me your 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.190
 pinoso this sniper surely some 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.720
 saying that is a lie beyond affirming 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.220
 that he always burned he passes him from poor 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.240
 without assis but good it is thus what there is 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.220
 I hope you liked it and second 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.180
 leave your favorite ones and write 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.180
 for more goodbye
