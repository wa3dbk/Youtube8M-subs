00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello I 'm simon in this video 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.740
 it's about the question which three 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.450
 Excuses protect yourself before training 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.469
 which three you can found yours 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.179
 Cancel training 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.340
 there is really in my opinion 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.830
 just three really serious reasons 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 and everything else is really cheap 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.369
 really lazy excuse and exactly on the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 Of course we will not let ourselves 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.460
 the first because or in training 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 take was not as usual can do that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.849
 if you just have an extremely muscular condition 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.439
 has for example in the breast and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.090
 which is the breast day that can 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.740
 just have to deal with that you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 maybe somehow two days before that 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.130
 have your shoulder trained and have 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.630
 you already have a breast involvement and 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.980
 That's why you just notice an extreme 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.850
 Muscular ache in the breast that makes you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.830
 Of course, no sense 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.110
 exactly on the day then again the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.640
 because of that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.260
 Of course, a good reason to be 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 to postpone training by one day 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 or by two days to move 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.940
 Of course you could also do that exactly in that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.040
 pack both day if it is not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 Just the previous day was on 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440
 You just have to do the job individually 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.300
 look a little bit and so little 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.950
 that's why it's so important when you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.330
 Muscles are not on the 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.830
 Muscular hangover on it train the whole 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.960
 does not do anything if the muscle is still 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.610
 in the recovery is repaired in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.390
 Process if you want, then you can 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 Of course not the next one 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 growth step put the whole 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.510
 does not work so we come to 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.860
 second excuse that counts and at the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 I'll tell you austria in all honesty 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 take your body seriously take yours 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.290
 physical needs seriously and it 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.730
 is always the case if you just 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.980
 I realize I'm getting sick or something 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.810
 Sore throat thick almonds are something 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.159
 always vorboten and sometimes you get 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.690
 so what else under control by getting there 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.550
 makes a decent vitamin bomb 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.600
 by simply lying down quietly 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.340
 maybe a bit zinc and stuff 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.050
 continue as you get there often still in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.790
 but not always when you 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.710
 do you realize you 're sick dubÃ© is something on 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.240
 to stay in training every case because 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 you really have any chance in it 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.540
 Imst that you still recover and then 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.310
 you usually need something really bad 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.170
 and then it can somehow 14 days 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.580
 do not go instead of just two 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.810
 days a bit quiet man on 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.850
 completely clean up the third day 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.380
 can therefore very importantly a reason of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.970
 In any case , if you are sick 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.650
 if you get sick if you just 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.420
 feeling today is and how not mine 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.250
 day i think i'll get sick then 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.880
 Every training case is the same 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.350
 third reason 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.870
 you will experience it again and again that you 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 ne sms you can get me when moving 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.970
 help is very difficult stuff too 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.610
 carry 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.900
 you will always be the experience 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.850
 maybe you too a friend 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.860
 call and say I have to go with me 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.240
 somehow paint the walls to see 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.010
 not quite so white and so on 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.690
 continue and immediately clear course helps 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.430
 your friends but only after the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.810
 training after training day is spent 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.700
 even further training 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.290
 and then you can do your things 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.150
 very important, even if you are somebody 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.530
 somewhere to pick up the tries 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.120
 to do things that you afterwards 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.740
 at least still going to training or 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.660
 best make only recommend and 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.280
 after that any friendship services 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.140
 Finally, the training was proven 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.550
 Dut the whole thing is just on the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.140
 plan and the whole is for the very 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.150
 binding so a very solid 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.770
 part of his life an exception 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.209
 Of course there is also if 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.489
 Mum calls you and you can ask me 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.660
 the water boxes from the car in the 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.280
 carry cellar then you do that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.630
 of course, if you have something from 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.489
 you then just want to see the matter 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.930
 very different from the woman you are under 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.280
 pain has balanced on this world 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.840
 you are definitely everyone 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.310
 Pleased guilty and that right there 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.660
 then really does not count training 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.000
 since then nothing attracts what reason 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.350
 if mum calls then immediately and if you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.770
 then go to sports is actually 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.420
 no matter 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.100
 that's why at the place very important 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.540
 Did not seek excuses if you really did 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.310
 That's why I'm in training 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.959
 then you can count the course 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.700
 and it has just heard which 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.709
 reasons do not count and which reasons do not 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.580
 In this sense, let us see that 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.140
 start training 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.090
 I'm starting now by seeing you in the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.090
 next video variety new simon
