took my indie kitchen shears which I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
took my indie kitchen shears which I
probably<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:18.990> than<00:01:19.140> any<00:01:19.380> instrument<00:01:20.130> in

the kitchen and I cut little holes like

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.469 
the kitchen and I cut little holes like
this<00:01:24.470> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> package<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.030> cut<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> bowl

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this in the package when I cut a bowl

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.410 
this in the package when I cut a bowl
it's<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> top<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.670> using<00:01:29.970> shears<00:01:30.240> so

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it's off the top and using shears so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's off the top and using shears so
much<00:01:30.600> they're<00:01:30.840> dull<00:01:31.430> cut<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> hole<00:01:32.640> across<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
much they're dull cut a hole across the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.469 
much they're dull cut a hole across the
top<00:01:33.619> basically

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
top basically

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.530 
top basically
it's<00:01:35.869> like<00:01:36.080> an<00:01:36.200> insolent<00:01:36.680> step<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:38.150> just<00:01:38.360> sit

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
it's like an insolent step so just sit

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.880 
it's like an insolent step so just sit
there<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:38.750> run<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.020> water<00:01:39.170> through<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:39.560> what

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
there and run the water through it what

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.499 
there and run the water through it what
it<00:01:40.040> does<00:01:40.070> washes<00:01:40.820> out<00:01:40.970> all<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.240> kind<00:01:41.450> of

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
it does washes out all that kind of

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.270 
it does washes out all that kind of
