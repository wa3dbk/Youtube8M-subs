00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 and I said guys - more videos from 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:14.070
 replays a great Friday we all go 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:16.049
 start another review josÃ© aranda instead is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 an exotic hand cannon called the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.189
 last word with eight bullets from the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.410
 charger your liabilities are 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.289
 damage stability is not that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.779
 need to take a free kick and this weapon 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.910
 It has a precision bonus around shooting 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 free as well as titan items and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
 Arcane has also made the review of this weapon 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.570
 then leave the links of all of them here 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.530
 above to explain yourself and have more 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.420
 Details 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.670
 This review will focus on the changes 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.170
 that will occur in the hand and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 also in the last word 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 a lot of people were using the carts 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.800
 hand sniper and the band saw this and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 correct in pet 2.0 causing me to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.579
 I need greater proximity to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.309
 she did the most damage she also took a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 little of the acist of mira in the head the long 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.149
 away causing you not 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.640
 You get on epal guy with more 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.559
 at one kilometer then 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.380
 goals we want hand in hand would be this 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.689
 short distance and the last word as 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 has a short range suffers much more 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.950
 with this in addition to January general the last 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.920
 I got a little word from her that I 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.619
 as a balancing act in the real 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.860
 next to the reach of her that was 20 goes 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.840
 for 10 the stability of it was 30 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.330
 Go to 20, that's it. 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 very expensive to half- small cancer 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.960
 and stability with a weapon that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.939
 take too fast 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 the skills is a bad number having me 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.560
 I can not take it very fast and she 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.700
 it is very stable it still manages very 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 headshot 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.979
 something corrected in the gun and they 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.890
 they will focus a lot not to shoot without 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 look guy now when you look 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.750
 really will decrease a lot of damage then 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.970
 I'll force you and judge you pets and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.670
 try to play without having to pay in bulk 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.130
 bonus damage there and to make what 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 really is the proposal of the weapon 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.820
 reminding her that she will continue to be 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.159
 a very good weapon is not this balance 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.770
 and overall it was not only she who suffered this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.729
 a thorn among other hand falcon 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.769
 so watch a review above to see 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.900
 the other details of it see how they 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.239
 gameplay playing with it if you do not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.170
 have not seen and we are going to 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.690
 next item 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.659
 the digital item is his name is warrior 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.349
 eternal he comes there with 56 intellect and 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.209
 75 of oscillation but super disciplines 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.220
 energy from casualties other than 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.099
 guardians restore life when you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.450
 picks up an org and provides refresh or 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.400
 bolts of chaos 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.890
 He is a great is a they become 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.840
 Really, you can go to 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.989
 with 101 points giving 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.940
 small life orb still kind counting 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.609
 no pv it's alright that you 're there 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.310
 the energy history of the 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.440
 super ability he brings intellect 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.319
 you take the orb history of your life 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.569
 stay over 100 fi you get more tank 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.060
 with unstoppable and you can stay there 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.950
 in the middle and pvp face is good also not 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.599
 I'll use, for example, it 's very strong. 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.459
 course will not be more surprising day 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.379
 non -guardian casualties 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.989
 but he is in his life losing orbit 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.209
 can change the fight and he also has 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.329
 I held back and that is very important in 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.730
 time of the confrontation then click up and 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.090
 complete review and that I brought 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.380
 he is a little while ago frogs are there and we are going 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.319
 He understands hunter 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.480
 the hunter item is finally the boot 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.700
 e-mail bones that a lot of people were 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.319
 guarding for him I was crazy 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.019
 to review this item and used 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.419
 never brought it comes with 151 of 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.370
 discipline your liabilities are carry 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.859
 more heavy-duty ammunition improves 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.959
 double jump for an additional jump 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.269
 The item brings discipline and both 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.579
 evidence as the precise gunslinger 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.190
 discipline very good and the cattle two 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.129
 classes are very good to make the game 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.930
 place both the PV and in pv pp 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.359
 but everyone knows that the big 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.269
 differential is this increased 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.859
 Dome over there on the day walkway 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.109
 improves the double jump then many 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.599
 people think like this or not 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.970
 gunslinger use triple jump then bill 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.129
 as a smoking room double smoking name 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.379
 Initial skill upstairs there is 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.169
 you look at this double jump is 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.880
 very poor dead student then this 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.769
 height then if you use the triple jump 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.900
 You're going to have four jumps. 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.259
 so imagine you give it to places 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.319
 very randles so to fly over the 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.300
 postes la rose as non-Croatian 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:35.150
 beach and judging us this kind of mass 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.520
 where he did not give before because of the people 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.979
 hunter is underneath the un break dance is 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.349
 too good, too, because there's this 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.090
 very high mobility in a residence not 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.180
 You can jump very fast if you move too far. 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.460
 fast with a triple jump in that 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.030
 in class can not make some place 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.550
 Great in there in the prison side manages to be 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.860
 more - much more easily with this 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.680
 item so I'm not talking that type 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.979
 Our best and kind, you came to 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.440
 shake the other there would speck in 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.199
 floor, do not understand that you can 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.210
 make great place with them then you can 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.639
 give you an unconstitutional training and 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.219
 see what you can do with it but 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.349
 Of course, another 27 poems by the hunter 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.550
 that gives a near to a grotesque 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.889
 Italian 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.560
 compared to this it gives an additional leap and 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.690
 in pvp face a little this is not going to do 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.099
 Our kind indicates difference, but you can 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.460
 I want to make you some nice things with him. 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.930
 As I said there are laws of a comic book in the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.259
 faces 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.240
 those behind climb up on the pick up 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.630
 behind the half a month 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.550
 the initial measure is that it complies with item 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.529
 See what you can do, comment. 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.750
 under this kind did our such 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.669
 played with this one I could have jumped on 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.050
 Such a place that we did not give 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.900
 comment on the places you most 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.000
 They like you with a cool look. 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.159
 before you can not get there and 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.900
 They succeeded with this boot or pv pp 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.690
 today that you killed a guy who 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.180
 way more mass using this and let's 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.370
 an item of arkan the understands arcane is a 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.080
 fan his name and company robes 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.150
 of the vacuum with 159 passive forces are 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.800
 improved virot jackson comes with 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.930
 pomegranate energy 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.599
 carry more handgun ammunition and 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.060
 load and more ammunition of heavy weapons 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.669
 this item has also come to see us with 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.810
 again then I brought a review of him 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.760
 up here 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.380
 There you go. 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.240
 some points quickly 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.030
 velopt jackson improved depending on the 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.250
 amount of enemies that have near it 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.620
 increases and the amount of viro- 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.340
 track type opponents sometimes 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.190
 increases 1 or 2 to 1 gives a difference 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.260
 so depending on how much you have 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.639
 but it will play well on both sides. 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.800
 It's not going to change anything, do you understand? 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.660
 but what really counts is comes up with 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.730
 pomegranate energy so whenever you 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.900
 Back to life, you already liked it there. 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:03.320
 type fps game and bo code df you 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.750
 I have always been reborn with Garnet. 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.300
 hand cannon ammunition there it increases 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.370
 in 20 bullets and carries more ammunition than 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.560
 Special weapons I always think a lot 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.400
 valid because it does not stipulate which body 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.770
 Special 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.100
 so it's up to you to use and 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.290
 I like sniper or shotgun more 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.020
 merger and also does not have what she likes 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.120
 but right because depending on the map uses a 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.550
 and depending on the other spindle depends 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.620
 style of play that map proposes 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.900
 buy heavy ammunition always people 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.820
 Do not know when you will stop bringing this 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.380
 He will stop bringing it but I intend to 

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.780
 is that if it stops I have a stock 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.180
 to lend it goes to sell to you 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.060
 for a foreign currency at the moment 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.979
 I prefer to sell by lumen which is more useful 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.500
 the vector badge if you do not want 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:51.020
 spend your coins there that have the 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:54.110
 fragments of light left over from them 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.400
 in the ingram maathai that comes there the author 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.710
 you wish 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.360
 No more is this, I hope you have. 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.940
 I like the video, do not forget to leave it. 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.289
 that like underneath favorite is 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.150
 subscribe to the channel
