so in this video I'm going to be showing

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.620 
so in this video I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> style<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.289> using<00:00:25.470> for<00:00:25.830> quantum<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
you the style I'm using for quantum and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
you the style I'm using for quantum and
as<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.590> pretty<00:00:29.010> much<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.340> be

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
as you can see I'm pretty much gonna be

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
as you can see I'm pretty much gonna be
using<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.760> color<00:00:29.939> scheme<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.420> white<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:30.990> blue

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
using the color scheme of white and blue

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200 
using the color scheme of white and blue
since<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.160> kind<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.430> suits<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
since I think it kind of suits the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.900 
since I think it kind of suits the
powerset<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:35.280> we'll<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.820> gonna

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
powerset and what we'll do is I'm gonna

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
powerset and what we'll do is I'm gonna
go<00:00:36.090> through<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:36.600> style<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.350> controller
