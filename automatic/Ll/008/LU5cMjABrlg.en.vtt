 hello dear viewers we are glad you 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.930
 welcome on our channel today 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.430
 us on toyota wish test 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:37.199
 This car produced in 2005 with 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.769
 driven by one neighbor in 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:44.750
 the volume is not at 8 one point eight 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:49.670
 liters and output of 130 horsepower case 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 what I would like to say about the engines 1z 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.980
 engine released after 2005 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.320
 Dont Have 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.320
 he is a year of butter 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.430
 and engines previously released had 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.370
 structural defect with piston 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.470
 group which led to a twist 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.800
 oil scraper rings 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.910
 and increased oil consumption was treated 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.730
 replacing 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.680
 pistons on newer from newer 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.850
 models 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.409
 who you 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.570
 about the divider give all the salon go that 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.659
 As for the cabin in the cabin enough 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.409
 spacious even tall drivers 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.979
 fit here without any problems sit 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.159
 comfortable sitting moderately soft with side 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.159
 support 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.110
 the steering wheel is regulated here only 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.700
 by height 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 Sorry I am on the flight 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.830
 regulated but it is compensated 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.370
 seat configuration which is regulated 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.370
 by height 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 that's the way i think i will 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.069
 now let's sit back 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.120
 here I am sitting by myself , my legs are not 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.370
 cleaned up 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.370
 there is still distance to the head still places 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.370
 a bunch 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.950
 basically 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.730
 comfortable enough I think that here 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.920
 two people fit without problems 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.940
 the third will be cramped 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.940
 let's see show 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.860
 what to say about the trunk 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:59.100
 the trunk here is just huge 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:03.550
 there are also various niches 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.270
 small things coasters specially for 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:12.520
 third row seats also under the floor 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.220
 there is a niche for tools reserve 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.230
 here is fixed on the bottom 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.890
 in our boats it is not very convenient 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.400
 as a reserve all the time dirty and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:29.310
 reach them very nice now we 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.310
 we'll show you how it looks 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.330
 if I tell you that I am not comfortable here 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.170
 i won't say anything i rest here at all 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.410
 in all that is possible and in the side 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.590
 upholstery and in the seat and head rests on 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.550
 the roof in general is an adult here 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.230
 just sitting is unreal well 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.700
 some baby or miniature 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.700
 girls I think he will be fine 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.020
 for an adult it is only up to the store and back 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.020
 but not more 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.629
 we will certainly not bury much more 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.019
 like what's the boot so i think 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:21.440
 that we honestly will drive this car home 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:25.190
 can be said about for from the driver's seat 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.430
 when you visibility is not to say 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.550
 very bad 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.270
 but not very good interferes with this one 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.270
 wide stand 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.620
 Well, in general, the side mirrors everything is fine 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.520
 see even see all 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.880
 special mirrors therefore in general 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.880
 not bad 

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:52.839
 the engine is quiet enough by the way 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.929
 works in his cabin practically not 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.929
 heard 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.479
 With regards to noise insulation 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.220
 here 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.220
 was from tires 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.650
 any such obvious noise 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.270
 Can not hear 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.270
 insulation pissing pretty 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.020
 as for the dynamics of the 7 seater 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.020
 million on 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.699
 let's try overclocking 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.360
 instead 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:03.210
 separately I would like to say about 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.960
 interior trim plastic pretty soft 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.830
 squeaks are not observed anywhere 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.610
 although that is, the car is already enough 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:19.680
 krishne age no creaks nowhere 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.009
 that's not even on a bumpy road 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.009
 heard 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.530
 what to say about the suspension 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.530
 suspension 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.390
 moderately hard 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.699
 don't say that 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.699
 too soft by car to leave by 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.440
 but basically 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.440
 I think that Nick 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.819
 still the car will not become 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.819
 on irregularities 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.620
 This is especially for those people who 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:10.700
 want registration this car in disgrace 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:15.530
 say what the market is now worth from 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.440
 400 thousand depending on the year of manufacture and 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.650
 year condition 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.650
 there are instances 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:28.749
 which costs 350 360000 but usually 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:33.249
 homes cars feather years of release and 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:35.409
 pretty poor condition 

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:38.219
 that is, you restore them too 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:38.219
 fan of those means 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:46.110
 normal car starts somewhere 

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:49.409
 with 450 and your 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.310
 it was a test drive toyota wish
