00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
it's pretty amazing eventually with the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.620

Quattro<00:04:11.460> in<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.610> color<00:04:11.790> i<00:04:12.060> would<00:04:12.360> probably

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
Quattro in the color i would probably

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.710

3d<00:04:28.980> TVs<00:04:29.640> out<00:04:29.790> there<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.810> all<00:04:30.990> looking

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020

3d TVs out there so it's all looking
good<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:31.920> mean<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.430> thought<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:33.000> would<00:04:33.120> it

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
good so I mean I I thought that would it

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.180 
good so I mean I I thought that would it
would<00:04:33.540> make<00:04:33.720> a<00:04:33.750> difference<00:04:33.870> for<00:04:34.290> yellow<00:04:34.680> alone

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
would make a difference for yellow alone

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.860 
would make a difference for yellow alone
and<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.940> makes<00:04:36.090> difference<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.570> all<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
