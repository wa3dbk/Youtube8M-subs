 hello com is done these are of pointcom congratulations and I'll talk to you 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.960
 of a topic that 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.240
 already someone had asked before they are the signs for baby 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.830
 baby appointments are very important 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.610
 inside these vehicles because our plans 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.050
 they are the most vulnerable passengers 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.369
 imagine these 100 percent made if you thought for the size the weight and the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.789
 stage of our dt 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.700
 then a true Sicilian valve 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.750
 as well as the other two made in the vehicles the cyclones of security 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.660
 to avoid 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.629
 accidents 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.170
 well, babies are so small that they need 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.329
 a pair of pombo shoe the little ones that are 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.940
 made especially for them 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.860
 something that you have to take into account is very important is that they have to have 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.880
 cushions protections rosemary photo 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.980
 2 you have to have seat belts 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.630
 intimate character intimate of the unique 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.060
 according to the stage before that of the size of tom brady 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.350
 another thing that you have to be very well obviously is that the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.150
 seatbelt work well in your vehicle because the seat of 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.200
 safety of our vehicles 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.240
 graham form great importance of great importance to the girls of our 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.520
 duty because they are the ones that are able to keep in fixed 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 static if I quote the instrument 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.820
 50 am in the talk the first appointment that we use immediately that is more or 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.990
 less when we take out our baby her 10 the first day d percent 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.470
 after the month that is when they say to you now yes to take out your baby 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.640
 This piece of tents 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.840
 these are in the form of 'w' avoided as I tell you tyson 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.520
 sun the position are so babies would see more refuel these because 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.170
 because your baby still has no control of his movement and still not 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.550
 you can sit 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.380
 then good panel a comfortable position 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.039
 the safety belts that bring adapted bar according to the street to the 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.229
 your baby's height 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.870
 so that they go who well protected 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.709
 and if you look you are smaller for what 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.630
 all were as they hug and in case of an accident or some blow 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.650
 can be well protected something that I highly recommend is from the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.440
 first stage until last night I cover that your baby can use some clues to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.179
 Car 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.670
 you should take into account that your baby should go in the back seat 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.450
 If you, for example, have an accident, they list it in the bag, from there you take 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.749
 your baby on the passenger side 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.889
 Maybe the appointment is broken and your baby suffers some more popular blow 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.849
 have a major accident so that's why it's very important that you have him in 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.340
 the back seat from the first to the utem until the last stage 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.749
 he should have used the tic tac 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.019
 these seven of each step we will move to the traditional appointment 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.309
 albanese and smaller there are bigger and what I recommend is that 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:00.409
 In Chiapas 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.039
 but what will it serve you? 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:03.519
 All this 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.260
 an appointment like this that helped me a lot for me know the sources 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.390
 to win here happens immediately I passed the traditional appointment 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.450
 that in addition to having a pretty cute design that went with my car 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:18.349
 well I liked the colors and I realized what was useful for several 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.929
 stages 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.999
 if you notice this car if you open it is not only part of the decoration 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.130
 Hugo 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.620
 of the design of the quote has a reason why if I do not sivine it is in a first 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.809
 stage not after the transfer and it's going to happen to the next 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:39.299
 You can apply seven months to buy another that is enforced and 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.319
 to accept 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.849
 another thing that I recommend is that the belts you fix the belts that 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.969
 they have here some supports for their little body 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.169
 different stages are covered josÃ© to which you can go seat 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.229
 shorter ones are longer according as there is crisis after you leave 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.899
 adapting offering of tumbes and simple 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:03.019
 this quote also what this parent has this team needs support when 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.870
 your baby that feels bigger and more independent 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 good it removes effects of this one to put the seatbelt of your 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.170
 vehicle but your baby will be safe with your car seat because it stays 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.419
 in nothing more like the sector like the seats that premieres today in the cinema 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.629
 well men 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.349
 another important thing is that you have several positions for ana 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.059
 the safety belt in the first stage because if you put it on the screen 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.759
 as he grows up b 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:31.539
 being more apt to have a seatbelt as 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.770
 vehicle that is the most preparing little by little for what when you have to 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.900
 leave the icnitas I can contribute 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.319
 a seat in the vehicle 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.319
 as an adult 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.900
 reporter 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.729
 imitate 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:44.620
 everything they see 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.880
 aziz who important that we dads set the example we use success 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.330
 agoda remember them 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.949
 a fundamental part to travel store our car in to have security 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.020
 correspondent 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.580
 to be sure 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.809
