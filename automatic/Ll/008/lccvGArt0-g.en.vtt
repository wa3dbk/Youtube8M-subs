00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:11.690
 it's been a while since you subtitled the 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.580
 movie made by sonic fans you will see 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.010
 I will answer the few comments that 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.660
 they left though many still look alike 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.869
 there is no second part and it is very difficult 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.260
 that comes out that's a good question, no 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.710
 I know how to send at least it is understood that 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.320
 liked the movie a few weeks later go 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.449
 now there are more people asking some 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.579
 They even believe that I did it with more 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.159
 people asking about the second 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.710
 good part will leave a message in the 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.760
 video and I will answer you again to see if 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.760
 they stop asking 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.289
 there are still people who ask not now is 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.199
 worse there are people that I already answered and 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.679
 they keep asking what annoyance I think 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.710
 has been asked how three times ok 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:00.769
 I'll make a video and it's good here 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.320
 painted 0412 with my special guest the 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.020
 Doctor metal sonic good even 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.729
 explain why I am here you are here 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.060
 to explain the questions of the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.759
 movie because I do not want to xd then 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.630
 You owe me a hamburger, do not you think 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.630
 besides ni 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.060
 there will be different universes of sonic 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.820
 that of the games that of the comics the one of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.580
 sonic sata m sonic underground east 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.530
 video etcetera all agree on what 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.450
 it was seen in the movie in which it appears 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.490
 sonic obviously in which robot new 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.040
 dominates the mobile in which the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.170
 emeralds and knuckles appear all 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.330
 they have their preferences for what they 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.270
 he made the film in general and not the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.190
 tsjm and did not die in the explosion the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.470
 conclusion is that doing a second 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.780
 movie would cost them in addition 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.520
 many criticized the movie alone 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.520
 because it took three small years 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.780
 and where is my hamburger
