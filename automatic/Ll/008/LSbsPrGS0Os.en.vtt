holes<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.769> you're<00:02:16.799> going<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.250> using<00:02:17.549> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
holes if you're going to be using the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.340 
holes if you're going to be using the
bolts<00:02:17.940> again<00:02:19.790> put<00:02:20.790> them<00:02:20.940> on<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.390> there<00:02:22.049> we<00:02:22.170> go

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
bolts again put them on and there we go

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.039 
bolts again put them on and there we go
slide<00:02:22.769> straight<00:02:23.130> home<00:02:23.370> now<00:02:24.209> if<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.720> haven't

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
slide straight home now if you haven't

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.479 
slide straight home now if you haven't
got<00:02:25.200> alloys<00:02:25.560> you've<00:02:25.769> got<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> standard<00:02:26.130> steel

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
got alloys you've got the standard steel

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.410 
got alloys you've got the standard steel
wheels<00:02:26.700> but<00:02:27.120> your<00:02:27.209> bolts<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.690> now<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:29.420> that

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
wheels but your bolts in now and that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.180 
wheels but your bolts in now and that
last<00:02:30.660> little<00:02:30.840> bit<00:02:31.050> we<00:02:31.319> need<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.620> wiggle<00:02:32.040> and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
last little bit we need to wiggle and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.650 
last little bit we need to wiggle and
then<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:32.700> go<00:02:32.849> home

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
then it will go home

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.040 
then it will go home
so<00:02:34.590> we're<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.430> ready<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.820> adjust<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> shoes

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
so we're now ready to adjust the shoes

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.320 
so we're now ready to adjust the shoes
properly<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.610> from<00:02:38.880> underneath

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
properly and we do that from underneath

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.590 
properly and we do that from underneath
and<00:02:39.510> behind<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.350> for<00:02:40.560> another<00:02:40.650> tidy<00:02:41.040> up

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
and behind so time for another tidy up

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.060 
and behind so time for another tidy up
remember<00:02:42.600> from<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.960> we<00:02:43.110> saw<00:02:43.320> before

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
remember from what we saw before

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.130 
remember from what we saw before
we're<00:02:44.730> poking<00:02:45.180> through<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> hole<00:02:45.870> at<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
we're poking through the hole at the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.770 
we're poking through the hole at the
back<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> back<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.830> plates<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:48.540> we

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
back of the back in plates and then we

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.840 
back of the back in plates and then we
are<00:02:48.990> just<00:02:49.560> putting<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.070> screwdriver<00:02:50.580> into

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
are just putting the screwdriver into

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.010 
are just putting the screwdriver into
the<00:02:51.000> stars<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.790> rotating<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.780> go<00:02:54.960> too

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
the stars and rotating and if you go too

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.920 
the stars and rotating and if you go too
far<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.920> you've<00:02:56.640> not<00:02:56.880> got<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.240> drum<00:02:57.480> locking

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
far and you've not got the drum locking

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.720 
far and you've not got the drum locking
up<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:58.860> check<00:02:59.070> from<00:02:59.250> time<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.700> time

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
up and you can check from time to time

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.400 
up and you can check from time to time
quite<00:03:00.150> simply<00:03:00.570> by<00:03:00.690> putting<00:03:00.870> your<00:03:01.050> hands<00:03:01.290> on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
quite simply by putting your hands on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.740 
quite simply by putting your hands on
here<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.770> rotating<00:03:02.490> you'll<00:03:03.360> hear<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> little

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
here and rotating you'll hear a little

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.020 
here and rotating you'll hear a little
bit<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.110> noise<00:03:04.230> obviously<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.550> at<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> moment

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
bit of noise obviously but at the moment

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.760 
bit of noise obviously but at the moment
it's<00:03:06.120> still<00:03:06.180> slack<00:03:06.570> you'll<00:03:07.050> go<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.560> wrong

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
it's still slack you'll go in the wrong

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.180 
it's still slack you'll go in the wrong
way<00:03:07.980> one<00:03:08.310> side<00:03:08.550> goes<00:03:08.790> up<00:03:08.820> one<00:03:09.420> side<00:03:09.660> goes<00:03:09.840> down

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
way one side goes up one side goes down

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.600 
way one side goes up one side goes down
okay<00:03:11.190> then

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
okay then

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.710 
okay then
nearly<00:03:12.180> there<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.330> do<00:03:15.480> is

nearly there and what you want to do is
do<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.020> all<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.350> way<00:03:16.470> till<00:03:16.740> it's<00:03:16.890> tight<00:03:17.280> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
do it all the way till it's tight you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.760 
do it all the way till it's tight you
can't<00:03:17.910> move<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.180> any<00:03:18.360> further<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:22.500> should

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
can't move it any further and it should

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.590 
can't move it any further and it should
be<00:03:22.890> tight<00:03:23.190> on<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.580> drum<00:03:23.820> there<00:03:24.090> there<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.450> go

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
be tight on the drum there there we go

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.380 
be tight on the drum there there we go
just<00:03:24.810> about<00:03:25.410> move<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.710> lot<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.100> force<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.640> then

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
just about move a lot of force and then

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.900 
just about move a lot of force and then
back<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.990> off<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.350> couple<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.890> clicks<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.580> just

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
back it off a couple of clicks and just

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.240 
back it off a couple of clicks and just
for<00:03:30.030> your<00:03:30.120> information<00:03:30.890> something<00:03:31.890> that<00:03:32.130> even

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
tightening up on the front hole you'll

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.410 
tightening up on the front hole you'll
go<00:03:37.770> in<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.980> downward<00:03:38.460> motion<00:03:38.490> for<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.150> cogs

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
go in a downward motion for the cogs

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.110 
go in a downward motion for the cogs
okay<00:03:40.260> we<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> same<00:03:40.890> with<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.340> back<00:03:41.760> ones

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
now which will be in the upward motion

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.550 
now which will be in the upward motion
to<00:03:44.370> lock<00:03:44.520> it<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:46.050> we'll<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.380> about

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
to lock it up and then we'll just about

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.580 
to lock it up and then we'll just about
be<00:03:46.830> done<00:03:47.010> just<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> hem<00:03:47.880> break<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.300> go<00:03:48.590> okay

be done just the hem break to go okay
once<00:03:50.280> we've<00:03:50.490> tidied<00:03:50.760> up<00:03:50.940> underneath<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:52.380> need

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
once we've tidied up underneath we need

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.230 
once we've tidied up underneath we need
to<00:03:52.650> go<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.070> centralize<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.700> brake<00:03:53.910> shoes

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.030 
to go and centralize the brake shoes
which<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.600> do<00:03:54.750> by<00:03:54.930> sitting<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.590> driver's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
which we do by sitting in the driver's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.740 
which we do by sitting in the driver's
seat<00:03:56.070> putting<00:03:56.940> our<00:03:57.060> foot<00:03:57.240> down<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.720> brake

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
seat putting our foot down on the brake

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.060 
seat putting our foot down on the brake
pedal<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.290> couple<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.650> times

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
pedal a couple of times

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.650 
pedal a couple of times
and<00:03:59.160> then<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.520> can<00:03:59.670> slide<00:03:59.910> underneath<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:00.600> do

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
and then we can slide underneath and do

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.720 
and then we can slide underneath and do
the<00:04:00.780> final<00:04:00.960> adjustment<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:02.100> should<00:04:02.400> hear

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730

one wrong hem brake cable but

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.350 
one wrong hem brake cable but
fortunately<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.160> bit<00:04:41.340> too<00:04:41.700> long<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.300> we

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
fortunately it's a bit too long and we

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.820 
fortunately it's a bit too long and we

but basically what we're looking to do

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.420 
but basically what we're looking to do
is<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.380> get<00:04:46.590> these<00:04:46.800> together<00:04:49.190> keep<00:04:50.190> this

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
is to get these together keep this

the<00:06:02.010> rear<00:06:02.160> brakes<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.849> in<00:06:02.970> this<00:06:03.090> case<00:06:03.330> we<00:06:03.570> have

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
the rear brakes and in this case we have

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.420 
the rear brakes and in this case we have
replaced<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.289> rear<00:06:04.470> shoes<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:05.010> a<00:06:05.070> couple<00:06:05.280> of

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
replaced the rear shoes and a couple of

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.180 
replaced the rear shoes and a couple of
the<00:06:05.520> star<00:06:05.760> adjusters<00:06:06.500> we've<00:06:07.500> adjusted<00:06:07.680> the

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
the star adjusters we've adjusted the

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.670 
the star adjusters we've adjusted the
brake<00:06:08.430> shoes<00:06:08.700> back<00:06:08.940> up<00:06:09.120> again<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:10.410> course

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
brake shoes back up again and of course

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.290 
brake shoes back up again and of course
along<00:06:11.010> the<00:06:11.070> way<00:06:11.310> I've<00:06:11.580> done<00:06:11.760> the<00:06:11.880> hand<00:06:12.060> brakes

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
along the way I've done the hand brakes

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.440 
along the way I've done the hand brakes
and<00:06:12.660> if<00:06:12.840> you<00:06:13.080> look<00:06:13.260> carefully<00:06:13.440> just<00:06:13.889> here<00:06:14.070> I

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
and if you look carefully just here I

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.700 
and if you look carefully just here I
bumped<00:06:15.450> my<00:06:15.510> head<00:06:15.660> whilst<00:06:16.080> underneath<00:06:16.560> the

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
bumped my head whilst underneath the

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.350 
bumped my head whilst underneath the
venn<00:06:16.889> so<00:06:17.190> even<00:06:17.460> if<00:06:17.550> you're<00:06:17.669> familiar<00:06:17.849> with<00:06:18.120> the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
venn so even if you're familiar with the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.540 
venn so even if you're familiar with the
jobs<00:06:18.630> you<00:06:18.810> can<00:06:18.990> still<00:06:19.229> clash<00:06:20.130> yourself

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
jobs you can still clash yourself

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.850 
jobs you can still clash yourself
somewhere<00:06:20.880> along<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.210> line<00:06:21.389> but<00:06:21.660> all<00:06:22.650> done

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
somewhere along the line but all done

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.580 
somewhere along the line but all done
and<00:06:23.010> dusted<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.760> final<00:06:24.150> thing<00:06:24.330> to<00:06:24.539> do<00:06:24.750> is<00:06:25.020> to

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
and dusted the final thing to do is to

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.320 
and dusted the final thing to do is to
check<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.099> your<00:06:26.340> pedals<00:06:26.700> obviously<00:06:27.210> is

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
check that your pedals obviously is

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.150 
check that your pedals obviously is
better<00:06:27.539> than<00:06:27.750> it<00:06:27.840> was<00:06:27.960> before

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
better than it was before

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.460 
better than it was before
lead<00:06:29.820> off<00:06:29.970> your<00:06:30.150> brakes<00:06:30.389> and<00:06:30.690> then<00:06:31.020> go<00:06:31.200> off<00:06:31.320> for

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
lead off your brakes and then go off for

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.110 
lead off your brakes and then go off for
a<00:06:31.530> test<00:06:31.740> drive<00:06:32.010> and<00:06:32.280> if<00:06:32.580> you<00:06:32.669> want<00:06:32.849> to<00:06:32.940> know<00:06:33.060> how

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
a test drive and if you want to know how

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.909 
a test drive and if you want to know how
to<00:06:33.180> bleed<00:06:33.479> your<00:06:33.630> brakes<00:06:33.660> off<00:06:34.050> have<00:06:34.320> a<00:06:34.349> look<00:06:34.680> for

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
to bleed your brakes off have a look for

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.430 
to bleed your brakes off have a look for
the<00:06:35.010> just<00:06:35.250> campers<00:06:35.669> hell<00:06:36.330> -<00:06:36.599> video<00:06:36.990> on<00:06:37.260> that

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
the just campers hell - video on that

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.710 
the just campers hell - video on that
subject<00:06:37.740> one<00:06:38.700> final<00:06:39.150> thing<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.450> remember

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
subject one final thing to remember

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.330 
subject one final thing to remember
after<00:06:40.260> you've<00:06:40.380> done<00:06:40.470> a<00:06:40.530> few<00:06:40.770> hundred<00:06:41.130> miles

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
after you've done a few hundred miles

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.159 
after you've done a few hundred miles
you<00:06:41.910> will<00:06:41.940> more<00:06:42.570> than<00:06:42.599> likely<00:06:42.720> have<00:06:43.110> to

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
you will more than likely have to

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.659 
you will more than likely have to
readjust<00:06:43.560> your<00:06:43.889> brakes<00:06:44.130> and<00:06:44.400> give<00:06:44.520> them

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
readjust your brakes and give them

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.850 
readjust your brakes and give them
another<00:06:44.910> quick<00:06:45.210> bleed<00:06:45.479> off<00:06:45.720> it's<00:06:46.560> just<00:06:46.770> the

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
another quick bleed off it's just the

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.450 
another quick bleed off it's just the
process<00:06:47.070> of<00:06:47.460> bedding<00:06:47.669> in<00:06:47.880> the<00:06:48.000> new<00:06:48.180> shoes
