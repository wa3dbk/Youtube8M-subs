00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.290
 how to lay blades or slabs 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.929
 vinyl to clipping level of difficulty a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 hammer give a new youth to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.460
 your floor with slabs or blades 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.869
 vinyl it exists in version to clip 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.850
 or self adhesive 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.869
 in both cases the break is one 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.580
 great simplicity 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 at the example of this soul break to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.579
 clip you will need the soul 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:36.329
 clipping vinyl equip you with a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.360
 cutter one meter from a mallet 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.530
 devices of a rule of a square 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.530
 and a pencil 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.379
 after taking off the old ones 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 carpet or lino and remove the remains 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.020
 of colo cleaner clean up the only one to 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020
 background 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 the floor must be dry soil Ellis 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.010
 very irregular can be caught up with 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.489
 a smoothing mortar no need to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 undercoat 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 unless you want to catch up with 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.350
 small irregularities calculate the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 surface to be covered is increased fact 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 slightly because the losses due to 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 cuts are minimal 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.060
 store your slides at room temperature 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 24 hours before the break 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 to improve these visuals it is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.939
 recommended to place the blades 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.310
 parallel to the greatest length 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.659
 of the play but you can also 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 lay in the direction of light 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.399
 projected through the windows to save 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.130
 a dilatation space on the outskirts of 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.290
 the interposed part of the small hold of 5 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.840
 mm vertically along walls 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.610
 on this model of parquet cut out the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.400
 big tongue is using a cutter 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.160
 and present there in the corner against 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.970
 wedges then engage the next in 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.100
 extension 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.290
 not to mention housekeeping and the space of 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.790
 dilation along the wall give 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.500
 some rubber mallet strokes 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.960
 to clip the junctions of the blades 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.060
 between them at the end of a row measure the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.140
 distance between the edge of the blade and the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.000
 hold against the wall 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 ideally 25 cm minimum to spot the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.200
 cut line present the last 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.750
 the soul against the previous 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.390
 but small tab against small 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.640
 tongue with which to locate and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 draw the line of cut in the line of the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.200
 tip of the previous blade 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.180
 marc ela shot with one or two dashes 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.480
 cutter leaning against a metal ruler 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.610
 and then fold to snap net arranged for 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.670
 keep an offset of a heart of 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.350
 the soul from one rank to another present the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.570
 blade to properly engage it in the system 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.480
 grooves then pushed thoroughly to 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.190
 clip in place the next slide with the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.610
 junction grooves well facing 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.500
 one from the other 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.500
 continue ramparts ans 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.040
 present the blade against the angle without 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.380
 forget about the expansion wedges and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.319
 plot a landmark for the length and a 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.900
 another for the width then traced the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.550
 pencil cut slice the cup of 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.830
 width over the entire thickness of the blade 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.230
 then practice cutting longer 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.080
 simply by two dashes of cutter and 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.239
 separation by folding presenting the blade 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.850
 against the pipe in the position it 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.790
 will once occupy seemed to be traced 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.930
 pipe passage with a 5 mm 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.269
 for dilatation 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.970
 then placed a spacer 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.420
 against the wall and postpone the rating in 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.760
 increasing by 5 mm again the copier from 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.739
 profile allows you to pick up both the 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.290
 outline of the pipes that that of the 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.810
 finally moldings of fos for cutting 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.480
 hard along the wall align a blade 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.370
 on the previous row then ask 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.920
 on top of another blade that you will make 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.459
 slide to the wall until you come in 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.989
 stop against the expansion wedges 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.920
 followed the edge of the soul to trace the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.200
 cut I break on the effects of matter

 mistaking the prosecutors to the medal 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.360
 clipping can equip all

 the House's rooms 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.650
