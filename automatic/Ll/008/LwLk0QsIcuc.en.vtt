 welcome to a recipe more 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.610
 if today we are going to make a recipe but 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:15.820
 not of pastry but of kitchen we are going to 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.680
 make meatballs in sauce to see how 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.330
 they come out to warn that the first time 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.970
 I do it so I do not know how it's going to come out 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.269
 let's start with the steps the 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.619
 ingredients are minced meat a kilo 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:33.760
 an onion nutmeg two teeth of 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.280
 garlic and parsley the first step will be cut 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.180
 we will split the onion in half 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.600
 one half will go in the sauce and the other half 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.480
 half will go with the meat once cut 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.130
 the onion we will cut the garlic mix 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.920
 trying to cry tears I 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.140
 jump the emotion give it salmon say 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.630
 so good that I do the following is 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 step will be to split several twigs of 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:04.380
 parsley and throw them to make the base 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.380
 now we will pour an egg 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.740
 after chopping it we will add a 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.550
 little milk salt and nutmeg one 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.030
 once the mixture is made, it is 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.030
 mince 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.909
 once dissolved the mixture or the base 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.909
 we will add a bit of nutmeg 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.830
 Once the dough is made we will take the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.290
 harmonicas with the hands and we will do 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.140
 pellets for balls but pulling 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.860
 balls is better and we will put it on 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.380
 bread crumbs 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:50.230
 well until you get to attack the mass one 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.900
 Once wrapped the meatballs as you see the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.200
 result would be this we would take and 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.510
 we would start frying them when doing 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.010
 written all we will start with the sauce 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.710
 while we are asking for the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.240
 meatballs let's prepare the sauce 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.300
 We cut half of the onion 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.149
 we leave Juliana before and put it in 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.600
 in a pan fried once the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.360
 meatballs let's make the sauce 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.640
 we have thrown the onion julienne and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.280
 a trickle of olive oil we have 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.590
 to wait for them to brown once golden 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.100
 the onions we have thrown two glasses 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.550

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.570
 sauce after 10 minutes this is the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 result as you see have been very 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.030
 tasty and very good we'll see you
