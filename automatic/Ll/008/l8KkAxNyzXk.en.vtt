00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.189

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.980
 rage one out of two jumps and a frost spell 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.059

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 nice because it's still 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.469

 I am currently priced 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.820
 do my prayer there is the Bible next door 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 in the economy 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.770
 not so far so there is way they 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.870
 make fall the age of two he help 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.120
 dead go go go marcus ahlm to 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.390
 ok chip against the guys we will not 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.700
 bother 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.050
 we'll just try a breakthrough 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.600
 except that it does not work at all launched 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.670
 the castle of clans there it would be 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.709
 really great that it starts with the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.270
 queen shares in the middle so what's that 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.440
 for the moment we do not really go there 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.600
 there is way to go there is less 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.709
 that there is and France o how to say 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.330
 how to say that currently the queen does not 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.580
 not go in the middle it's not really this 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.160
 which was planned at the hall galley 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.840
 it's gone in peanuts as it would say 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.280
 someone you know very well 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.060
 certainly what to do 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.820
 frankly there is way that it returns 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.400
 in the middle but hey that 's going to be hyper 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.600
 time already that two exquisite harkis third 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.160
 Well, we 'll have taken a lot of 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.900
 resources guys that we're not going to get 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.120
 hide this fall to the friendly 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.390
 this is the queen who dies ok except 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.590
