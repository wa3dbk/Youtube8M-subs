because I guess if I did the second
level<00:06:04.009> now<00:06:04.370> i<00:06:04.819> will<00:06:05.240> probably<00:06:05.630> run<00:06:05.990> out<00:06:06.050> of

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199

level now i will probably run out of
time<00:06:06.440> because

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
time because

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.220
