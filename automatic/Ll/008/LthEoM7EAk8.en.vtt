 Hello youtube I have a problem 

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:14.980
 I have this iPod 5 is the new one 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.980
 black but that does not matter now 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.079
 which color it is 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.470
 and there I have a jailbreak on it 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.529
 installed and got a trick 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.900
 and I believe this suddenly 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.689
 gone out and in any case I have 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.890
 I watch a lot of videos 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.920
 looked at youtube and found out 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.410
 that you can easily restore it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.350
 I have to and have to do that several times 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.540
 made and it does not work 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.770
 Now I want to show you what 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.780
 so if I turn it on , 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.860
 every case comes first this apple 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 logo and then it must be steady at itunes 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.329
 connect 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 and when I connect it to itunes 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.670
 I just want to show you 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.930
 I connected 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:35.450
 now itunes should be the same 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:39.020
 rise, he does not yet know him 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.020
 I'll do it now 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.120
 I'm in give you know now 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.670
 He has recognized him in maintenance 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.860
 Now I can restore that 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:47.240
 now sets again 60 minutes and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.240
 now I'll wait and see 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.260
 In any case, if I meet him again 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.260
 on 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:30.060
 Nothing works at all now 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:35.680
 I hope you can help me 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.540

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.390
 Unfortunately, it does not have to be restored 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.770
 folded 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.950
