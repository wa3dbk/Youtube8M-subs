00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.320
 and 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.690
 aside that we are all here in a 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.700
 new video this time we are going to do something 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.379
 quite different from what I do 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.110
 normally although lately in my 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.510
 channel will have seen some videos by 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.330
 example of doing experiments that your 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.520
 physics project for the school where 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.640
 you would have to do some experiments and 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.770
 upload them to youtube and others and thanks to 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.439
 everything that gave them like they helped 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.570
 pretty but good let's talk about 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.520
 that we are going to talk about what I come to 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.179
 show them is how to run faster 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.940
 the games and to use as an example let's 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:45.399
 to use portal 1 good one that we have 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.760
 here the game on the desk that 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.359
 You can see it's a forum 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.440
 a shortcut we put open fi location and we 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.220
 will take to the folder where it is 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.920
 hosted the file 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.730
 so what can we name this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.860
 is the executor of the original game 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:10.880
 this is the shortcut then to start 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.610
 let's sit down and open this file that 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.110
 I was going to leave the description 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.350
 it's called a formula that what this does 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.590
 file the process that we are going to do is 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.619
 that will make the game run more 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.630
 fast then these two places where 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.180
 this more quotes let's put the the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 name of the town then we put like this 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.800
 we copy the name of the game with control 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.670
 c 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.930
 and when he sees them 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.869
 we paste it not then we have here the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.270
 the formula is very good then now 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.820
 you have to save them in the folder where 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 the fire is lodged let's copy the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.740
 address and now we're going to save this 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.299
 archive 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.299
 in the turn 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.200
 and here we are going to paste this and we are going to 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.200
 save 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.550
 with the same name as the game 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.190
 then what you have to do is copy 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.740
 with this option 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:55.370
 Now we can and what we have left is this 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.410
 file what needs to be done now is 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.260
 erase this autonomy and that is 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.910
 the name of the game and so you do not have 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.450
 this logo this drawing as an icon 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.610
 we can press with right click 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.790
 properties we put here 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.540
 and with changing icon 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.709
 and here we can look first you have to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:27.469
 copy the address of the folder and here 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.290
 we can stick to can work search let's say 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:34.920
 the address and take us to the folder 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.769
 where we have to choose the file that 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.220
 has the icon that would be this and already 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.099
 we have this 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.819
 and our icon and when entering the game to 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.819
 to run faster 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:57.240
 I hope that you liked it is something 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.860
 that works pretty well for me and 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.940
 have served in many things so we 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.170
 we see the next goodbye to subscribe if 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.170
 you can 10
