00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.730
The eagle scans the horizon for her
dam.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.110
We are in the vast plains of
Mongolia.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.580
Nerves are raw skin, come
the first snow of winter season

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.320
Hunting for these falconers.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.859
The Kazakhs should wait for winter to
to hunt as this will give time to their

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.939
aquilas so they can give birth and raise their
small.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.680
Often wagered at major summits after
riding for hours

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.800
from here divisan more land from the plains and will be from where to launch their eagles.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.180
The earliest prey appears.
Now it's just a matter of releasing the eagles

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.920
and expect them to do their job.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.270
The eagle hunts its prey.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.200
The large size of this predator leaves no chance to escape this fox.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.069
And while the animal is stirred and even throws
bites, the accurate shots of large

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.809
eagle claws make the fox dies
quickly.
