and<00:00:12.750> today<00:00:13.049> we're<00:00:13.200> talking<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.590> skin<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
and today we're talking about skin and

and today we're talking about skin and
hormones<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.969> how<00:00:15.059> are<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> two<00:00:15.420> related

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
hormones and how are the two related

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.990 
hormones and how are the two related
well<00:00:16.740> what<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> lot<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.220> people<00:00:17.580> don't<00:00:17.699> realize

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
well what a lot of people don't realize

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.410 
well what a lot of people don't realize
is<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.600> what<00:00:19.380> gives<00:00:19.650> elastic<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.420> elasticity

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
is that what gives elastic is elasticity

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.470 
is that what gives elastic is elasticity
to<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.570> skin<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.560> collagen<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.640> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
to the skin is it's collagen and you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960 
to the skin is it's collagen and you
need<00:00:24.689> collagen<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.769> produced<00:00:26.160> well<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.640> cell

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
need collagen to be produced well a cell

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.310 
need collagen to be produced well a cell
that<00:00:27.150> produces<00:00:27.330> collagen<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that produces collagen it's the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.710 
that produces collagen it's the
fibroblasts<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:30.090> stimulates<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
fibroblasts and what stimulates the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.780 
fibroblasts and what stimulates the
fibroblast<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> major<00:00:31.710> stimulator<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
fibroblast so a major stimulator of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.750 
fibroblast so a major stimulator of
collagen<00:00:33.360> production<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.960> estradiol<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:35.640> is

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
collagen production is estradiol what is

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.790 
collagen production is estradiol what is
estradiol<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.930> form<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.290> estrogen

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
estradiol it's a it's a form of estrogen

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and as women and men age what happens to

women and men age obviously they they

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690 
women and men age obviously they they
lose<00:00:48.660> hormone<00:00:49.079> their<00:00:49.980> production<00:00:50.550> of

progesterone all the major sex steroids

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.400 
progesterone all the major sex steroids
hormones<00:00:58.530> decrease

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
hormones decrease

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.340 
hormones decrease
and<00:01:00.530> as<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.220> result<00:01:01.460> especially<00:01:01.910> estradiol<00:01:02.900> and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
and as a result especially estradiol and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.110 
and as a result especially estradiol and
decreasing<00:01:04.129> there's<00:01:04.670> less<00:01:04.850> collagen

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
decreasing there's less collagen

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.590 
decreasing there's less collagen
production<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:06.710> more<00:01:06.920> wrinkly<00:01:07.400> it<00:01:08.330> seems

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
production and so more wrinkly it seems

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.390 
production and so more wrinkly it seems
like<00:01:08.780> vanity<00:01:09.320> today<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.710> such<00:01:09.890> an<00:01:10.010> important

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
like vanity today is such an important

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.040 
like vanity today is such an important
thing<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.700> both<00:01:10.820> men<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.180> women<00:01:11.450> as<00:01:11.630> they<00:01:11.810> age

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
thing to both men and women as they age

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.900 
thing to both men and women as they age
and<00:01:12.380> people<00:01:12.530> are<00:01:12.740> getting<00:01:12.830> facelifts

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
and people are getting facelifts

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.020 
and people are getting facelifts
facelifts<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.750> Botox<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.710> fillers<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.520> can

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
facelifts and Botox and fillers and can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.420 
facelifts and Botox and fillers and can
some<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.210> these<00:01:17.390> things<00:01:17.930> be<00:01:18.220> reduced<00:01:19.220> or

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
some of these things be reduced or

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.240 
some of these things be reduced or
prevented<00:01:19.460> by<00:01:20.180> balancing<00:01:21.050> hormones<00:01:21.220> well<00:01:22.220> I

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
prevented by balancing hormones well I

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.219 
prevented by balancing hormones well I
think<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:23.450> know<00:01:23.570> there<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.900> role<00:01:24.200> for

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
think you know there is a role for

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.499 
think you know there is a role for
cosmetic<00:01:25.040> surgery<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:26.060> know<00:01:26.150> that's<00:01:26.330> up

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
cosmetic surgery and you know that's up

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.450 
cosmetic surgery and you know that's up
to<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.720> individual<00:01:27.259> but<00:01:27.470> what<00:01:28.130> people<00:01:28.430> should

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.040 
to the individual but what people should
be<00:01:28.700> thinking<00:01:29.030> about<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.390> beauty<00:01:29.720> from<00:01:29.869> the

be thinking about is beauty from the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.400 
be thinking about is beauty from the
inside<00:01:30.440> and<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.310> important<00:01:31.729> effects<00:01:32.060> of

inside and the important effects of

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.990 
inside and the important effects of
hormonal<00:01:33.410> balance<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.160> particularly

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
hormonal balance and particularly

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.930 
hormonal balance and particularly
estrogen<00:01:35.690> they've<00:01:36.440> done<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.649> study<00:01:37.070> where<00:01:37.910> they

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
estrogen they've done a study where they

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.850 
estrogen they've done a study where they
compared<00:01:38.420> postmenopausal<00:01:38.899> women<00:01:39.410> who<00:01:39.740> were
