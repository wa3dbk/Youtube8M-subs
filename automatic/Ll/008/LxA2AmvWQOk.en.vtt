00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
pictures worth a thousand words do we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.730 
pictures worth a thousand words do we
have<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.629> picture<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.310 

to<00:00:54.830> someone<00:00:55.190> if<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:55.700> do<00:00:55.910> maybe<00:00:56.630> I'll<00:00:56.870> try<00:00:57.050> your

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
to someone if you do maybe I'll try your

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.840 
to someone if you do maybe I'll try your
way<00:00:57.410> she's<00:00:57.770> no<00:00:58.010> but<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:58.280> draw<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.460> picture<00:00:58.700> for

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
way she's no but you draw a picture for

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.410 
way she's no but you draw a picture for
that<00:00:59.440> thank<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.680> 26<00:01:01.550> chuckles<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.060> so<00:01:02.180> for

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
that thank you 26 chuckles and so for

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.950 
that thank you 26 chuckles and so for
each<00:01:02.660> one<00:01:03.040> ok<00:01:04.040> 44<00:01:04.309> circles<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.270> 26<00:01:05.720> rules

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
each one ok 44 circles and 26 rules

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.940 
each one ok 44 circles and 26 rules
either<00:01:06.590> one<00:01:07.510> okay<00:01:08.510> instead<00:01:09.230> of<00:01:09.380> drawing<00:01:09.590> lots

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
either one okay instead of drawing lots

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.280 
either one okay instead of drawing lots
of<00:01:10.250> since<00:01:10.880> four<00:01:11.180> circles<00:01:11.570> is<00:01:11.720> easier<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.050> drop

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
of since four circles is easier to drop

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.710 
of since four circles is easier to drop
I<00:01:12.440> might<00:01:12.650> do<00:01:12.800> that<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.190> instead<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.360> drawing

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
I might do that and instead of drawing

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.480 
I might do that and instead of drawing
um<00:01:15.790> for<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:16.940> kidding<00:01:17.540> 26<00:01:18.020> dots<00:01:18.740> can<00:01:19.070> I<00:01:19.190> make<00:01:19.220> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
um for you kidding 26 dots can I make a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.020 
um for you kidding 26 dots can I make a
short<00:01:19.790> of<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.270> put<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.570> number<00:01:20.870> okay<00:01:22.030> yeah

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
short of it and put the number okay yeah

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.260 
short of it and put the number okay yeah
and<00:01:23.270> then<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:24.740> pretty<00:01:25.040> close<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.400> what<00:01:26.240> we

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and then this is pretty close to what we

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.969 
and then this is pretty close to what we
were<00:01:26.450> doing<00:01:26.720> down<00:01:26.870> there<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.410> if<00:01:27.560> i<00:01:27.650> wanted<00:01:27.920> to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
were doing down there so if i wanted to

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.390 
were doing down there so if i wanted to
make<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.400> like<00:01:28.700> boxes<00:01:29.300> touch<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:31.160> that<00:01:31.310> are

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
make it like boxes touch and that are

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.960 
make it like boxes touch and that are
all<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.790> same<00:01:33.040> then<00:01:34.040> i<00:01:34.130> could<00:01:34.310> put<00:01:34.430> 26<00:01:34.880> anytime

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
all the same then i could put 26 anytime

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.400 
all the same then i could put 26 anytime
okay<00:01:37.970> another<00:01:38.330> strategy<00:01:38.690> who<00:01:39.229> had<00:01:39.350> a

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
okay another strategy who had a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.800 
okay another strategy who had a
different<00:01:39.950> strategy<00:01:40.190> not<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.000> stack<00:01:41.600> and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
different strategy not the stack and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.790 
different strategy not the stack and
multiply<00:01:42.350> strategy<00:01:42.830> um<00:01:43.510> would<00:01:44.510> you<00:01:44.570> do<00:01:44.810> okay<00:01:45.500> I

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
multiply strategy um would you do okay I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.270 
multiply strategy um would you do okay I
have<00:01:46.160> one<00:01:46.190> for<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:47.020> Jolly<00:01:48.020> Oh<00:01:48.380> what<00:01:49.010> was<00:01:49.160> your

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
have one for the Jolly Oh what was your

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.420 
have one for the Jolly Oh what was your
drive<00:01:51.400> 26<00:01:52.400> /<00:01:52.640> 26<00:01:53.330> equals<00:01:53.690> 0<00:01:56.619> so<00:01:57.619> one<00:01:57.800> person<00:01:58.010> are

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
drive 26 / 26 equals 0 so one person are

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.330 
drive 26 / 26 equals 0 so one person are
you<00:01:58.550> defending<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.210> same<00:01:59.420> answer<00:01:59.750> yeah<00:02:00.340> okay

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
you defending the same answer yeah okay

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.029 
you defending the same answer yeah okay
so<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.820> use<00:02:02.149> 26<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.899> 26<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.590> what<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.830> get

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
so you use 26 and 26 in what you get

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:13.120 
so you use 26 and 26 in what you get
I've<00:02:04.820> at<00:02:05.380> 52<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.700> drawing<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.890> might

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
I've at 52 and on the drawing that might

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.170 
I've at 52 and on the drawing that might
look<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:14.950> vital<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.130> 52<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.760> play

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
look like that a vital the 52 I play

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.870 
look like that a vital the 52 I play
another<00:02:17.630> 50<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.440> worry<00:02:18.950> about<00:02:19.040> 50<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.640> come

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
another 50 to worry about 50 to come

double you double 26 and then doubled it
again<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.470> double<00:03:09.799> double<00:03:10.069> okay<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.799> a

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
again the double double okay is that a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.690 
again the double double okay is that a
triple<00:03:13.130> strategy<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:15.280> don't<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.370> if<00:03:16.489> that's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
triple strategy I don't know if that's

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.699 
triple strategy I don't know if that's
the<00:03:16.910> same<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.930> double<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.860> double<00:03:19.269> okay

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
the same it's a double and a double okay

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.440 
the same it's a double and a double okay
did<00:03:21.709> anyone<00:03:22.209> break<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.420> number<00:03:23.720> 26<00:03:24.350> apart<00:03:24.799> and
