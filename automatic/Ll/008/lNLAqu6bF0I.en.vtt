guy that is a big tortoise and I can

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.709 
guy that is a big tortoise and I can
understand<00:00:38.550> why<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.360> know<00:00:39.390> whether

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

it's<00:00:40.020> real<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> fake

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
it's real or if it's fake

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's real or if it's fake
so<00:00:43.620> why<00:00:43.739> don't<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.129> crawl<00:00:44.460> underneath

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so why don't we just crawl underneath

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520 
so why don't we just crawl underneath
the<00:00:45.030> shell<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.350> we

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the shell on this one and see what we

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.049 
the shell on this one and see what we
can<00:00:46.649> find<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:49.039> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> surface<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:50.969> we

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
can find out on the surface I think we

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150 
can find out on the surface I think we
can<00:00:51.210> discount<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.110> turtle<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.939 
can discount that this turtle is in the
Amazon<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> closer<00:00:55.260> look<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
Amazon if we take a closer look at the
