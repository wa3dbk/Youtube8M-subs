welcome to another quick tip episode
this<00:00:04.890> one<00:00:05.130> I'll<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.690> showing<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.899> some<00:00:07.319> branch

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
this one I'll be showing you some branch

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.120 
this one I'll be showing you some branch
mining<00:00:08.450> probably<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> easiest<00:00:10.019> well<00:00:10.500> not

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
mining probably the easiest well not

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.900 
mining probably the easiest well not
easy<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.120> most<00:00:12.450> efficient<00:00:13.049> way<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.910> find

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
easy as the most efficient way to find

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.609 
easy as the most efficient way to find
minerals<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.020> diamonds<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:17.390> blue<00:00:18.390> stone

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.750 

what<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> want<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:25.430> dig<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
what you want to do is just dig a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.780 
what you want to do is just dig a
straight<00:00:27.630> too<00:00:28.429> high<00:00:30.650> just<00:00:31.650> straight<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.130> for

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
straight too high just straight out for

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.209 
straight too high just straight out for
ways<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:35.250> every<00:00:35.880> fourth<00:00:36.540> block<00:00:37.219> so

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
ways and then I go every fourth block so

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.900 
ways and then I go every fourth block so
1<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:39.000> 1<00:00:39.120> 2<00:00:39.540> 3<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:41.879> just

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
1 here 1 2 3 here so that and then just

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330 
1 here 1 2 3 here so that and then just
go<00:00:42.390> straight<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.840> from<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.590> I'll<00:00:43.980> show<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
go straight out from here I'll show you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760 
go straight out from here I'll show you
real<00:00:44.640> quick<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:45.320> made<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> couple<00:00:46.530> different

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
real quick I made a couple different

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.360 
real quick I made a couple different
levels<00:00:47.629> see<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:49.020> went<00:00:49.530> straight<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
levels see I went straight out here and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
levels see I went straight out here and
then<00:00:50.489> every<00:00:51.210> fourth<00:00:52.309> block<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:54.449> straight

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
then every fourth block I go straight

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
then every fourth block I go straight
out<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:57.500> gives<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.739> highest

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
out and then that gives you the highest

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.310 
out and then that gives you the highest
chance<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.969> running<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:01.219> minerals<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
chance of running into minerals so that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
chance of running into minerals so that
you<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:05.040> wall<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:06.030> wall<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.630> then

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you see this wall this wall and then

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.969 
you see this wall this wall and then
they<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.700> wall<00:01:09.030> there<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.530> small

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
they and then this wall there is a small

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.289 
they and then this wall there is a small
chance<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.400> there'd<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.270> here

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
chance that there'd be something in here

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.380 
chance that there'd be something in here
but<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.110> small<00:01:13.409> chance<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.189> its<00:01:15.119> most

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
but it's a very small chance so its most

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.249 
but it's a very small chance so its most
efficient<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.170> every<00:01:16.290> other<00:01:16.409> every<00:01:17.340> 4

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
efficient to do it every other every 4

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
efficient to do it every other every 4
so<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.250> keep<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:22.670> I'll<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:24.600> some

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so you just keep going and I'll do some

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
so you just keep going and I'll do some
mining<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.100> find

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
mining for you see if I can find

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.429 
mining for you see if I can find
anything<00:01:26.580> real<00:01:26.759> quick<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.330> found<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.750> cave

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
anything real quick I found this cave

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
anything real quick I found this cave

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
here you find quite a few caves which is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.060 
here you find quite a few caves which is
another<00:01:39.509> good<00:01:39.750> way<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> find<00:01:40.259> minerals<00:01:40.650> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
another good way to find minerals so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.270 
another good way to find minerals so
it's<00:01:41.310> dark<00:01:42.710> all<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:44.299> anything<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.600> oh

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
let's try let's try this tunnel thing i

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.670 
let's try let's try this tunnel thing i
think<00:02:45.540> i<00:02:45.750> need<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.959> go<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> little<00:02:46.260> bit<00:02:46.440> further
