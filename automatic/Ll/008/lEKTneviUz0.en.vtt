hi

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.579 

so<00:05:34.849> we<00:05:34.909> had<00:05:34.999> some<00:05:35.180> very<00:05:35.210> limited<00:05:35.899> time<00:05:36.080> today

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:36.589 
so we had some very limited time today

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.079 
so we had some very limited time today
could<00:05:36.770> actually<00:05:36.919> get<00:05:37.460> out<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.789> ride<00:05:37.909> the

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.089 
could actually get out and ride the

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.719 
could actually get out and ride the
machines<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.839> we<00:05:39.680> had<00:05:39.770> about<00:05:39.919> two<00:05:40.129> laps<00:05:40.399> which

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
machines and we had about two laps which

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.999 
machines and we had about two laps which
equated<00:05:41.089> to<00:05:41.240> about<00:05:41.360> two<00:05:41.899> miles<00:05:42.110> of<00:05:42.529> riding<00:05:42.949> the

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
equated to about two miles of riding the

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.639 
equated to about two miles of riding the
machine<00:05:43.309> what<00:05:44.300> I<00:05:44.330> can<00:05:44.569> tell<00:05:44.779> you<00:05:44.839> about<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.409> is
