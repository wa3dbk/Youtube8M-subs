00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello to resume today our new section adapted electric 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.510
 on the acoustic guitar 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.069
 with both men bic declining list 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.009
 so here I propose you actually two picnics 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.089
 a first at 6 7% 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.089
 because it's actually saturated guitar not the dead end on the piece 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.849
 who will give this site so on the first minor chord 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.720
 so so in reality if we can decomposition 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.420
 two reasons 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.400
 identical 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
 so does not change it so strongly to 6 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.800
 for the second time the bases before the elect 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.860
 on a pace of two next 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.980
 and so she also modified two strips to play on a chord 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 must do twice the pattern since each king's body of pop art so 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 it will give what was needed 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.910
 the second technique is more difficult to put in place 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 and so to help you feel the placement of the departments of the Oueme 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.810
 parquet 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.070
 the tempo 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 strong enough to the sea the left foot 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 and so that's what it gives 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.110
 so once more gently 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.380
 concretely 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.330
 it happened 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 like this of this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.350
 one last time 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.350
 a port more gently 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.130
 a small note in passing the two rivals not at all the same group 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.569
 the first at bienne 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.959
 passed on the floor somehow 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.120
 the second was seconded and so it's not obvious that the albÃ¨res 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.329
 tonsils of indignation postiga 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 I see a choice between one on the other 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.060
 so the party on the web at fifteen days and not for the first and the sequel 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.069
 Reserve 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 Let's go 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.499
 ok will accept 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.059
 for the chord grid 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:48.229
 and not a lot of details of the 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.229
 those who know how to read the rhythm the details of the 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.039
 you find it on the site 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.780
 So here's a chef soon
