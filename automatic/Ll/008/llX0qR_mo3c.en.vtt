it<00:02:08.700> comes<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.090> jazz<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.950> like<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.190> explain<00:02:11.760> jazz

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it comes to jazz I like to explain jazz

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.490 
it comes to jazz I like to explain jazz
in<00:02:12.660> terms<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.740> moving<00:02:14.700> around<00:02:15.030> within<00:02:15.990> very

in terms of moving around within very
closely<00:02:16.860> related<00:02:17.310> keys<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:19.370> can't

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
closely related keys so you can't

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.850 
closely related keys so you can't
explain<00:02:21.239> all<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.020> chords<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.590> find

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
explain all of the chords that you find
