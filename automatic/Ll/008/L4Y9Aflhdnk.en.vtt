00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
think it was cheaper for mum to put us

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380 
think it was cheaper for mum to put us
all<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.740> car<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.610> sport<00:02:09.030> so

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.290 
doing in training is going to make it so
much<00:05:23.200> easier<00:05:23.650> when<00:05:23.890> you<00:05:24.130> do<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.150> English

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
much easier when you do the English

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.540 
much easier when you do the English
Channel<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:26.020> found<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:26.440> was<00:05:26.620> easy<00:05:27.130> because

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
Channel and I found it was easy because

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.960 
Channel and I found it was easy because
that<00:05:27.970> hard<00:05:28.300> work<00:05:28.540> was<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:29.560> hard<00:05:29.860> so<00:05:30.730> I<00:05:30.760> think

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
that hard work was so hard so I think

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.730 
that hard work was so hard so I think
it's<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.420> people<00:05:31.570> that<00:05:31.780> you<00:05:32.170> meet<00:05:32.380> along<00:05:32.680> the

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
it's the people that you meet along the

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.520 
it's the people that you meet along the
way<00:05:32.890> as<00:05:33.160> well<00:05:33.400> like<00:05:33.700> he<00:05:34.660> was<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.870> character<00:05:35.290> of

out and I remember yeah at that stage I

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.580 
out and I remember yeah at that stage I
was<00:07:29.520> hallucinating<00:07:29.849> and<00:07:30.479> I<00:07:30.569> seen<00:07:30.900> monkeys<00:07:31.379> on

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
was hallucinating and I seen monkeys on

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.709 
was hallucinating and I seen monkeys on
the<00:07:31.680> side<00:07:31.889> of<00:07:31.919> the<00:07:32.069> cage<00:07:32.280> and<00:07:32.639> Santa<00:07:33.330> Claus<00:07:33.509> on

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:33.719 
the side of the cage and Santa Claus on

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.200 
the side of the cage and Santa Claus on
the<00:07:33.810> boat<00:07:34.020> so<00:07:34.349> it's<00:07:34.860> like<00:07:34.979> that<00:07:35.159> 12<00:07:35.520> hour<00:07:35.759> where

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.210 
the boat so it's like that 12 hour where

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.680 
the boat so it's like that 12 hour where
I<00:07:36.479> wanted<00:07:36.990> to<00:07:37.050> get<00:07:37.259> out<00:07:37.469> but<00:07:37.740> I<00:07:37.800> guess<00:07:38.759> you<00:07:39.569> know

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
I wanted to get out but I guess you know

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.930 
I wanted to get out but I guess you know
you<00:07:39.750> have<00:07:40.139> that<00:07:40.319> toughness<00:07:40.620> inside<00:07:41.250> you<00:07:41.550> and<00:07:41.759> I

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 
you have that toughness inside you and I

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.760 
you have that toughness inside you and I
just<00:07:42.360> thought<00:07:42.539> well<00:07:42.779> if<00:07:42.930> I<00:07:43.050> get<00:07:43.229> out<00:07:43.379> I'm<00:07:43.620> going

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770 
just thought well if I get out I'm going

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.439 
just thought well if I get out I'm going
to<00:07:43.830> just<00:07:44.009> have<00:07:44.190> to<00:07:44.310> come<00:07:44.490> back<00:07:44.729> next<00:07:45.000> year<00:07:45.270> and

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:45.449 
to just have to come back next year and

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:48.200 
to just have to come back next year and
do<00:07:45.629> it<00:07:45.750> again<00:07:45.990> so<00:07:46.259> I'd<00:07:46.740> better<00:07:46.949> stay<00:07:47.310> and<00:07:47.699> so

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.210 
do it again so I'd better stay and so

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.179 
do it again so I'd better stay and so
that's<00:07:48.449> kind<00:07:48.750> of<00:07:48.870> my<00:07:49.020> thought<00:07:49.319> that's<00:07:50.099> an

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:50.189 
that's kind of my thought that's an

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:52.730 
that's kind of my thought that's an
accountability<00:07:50.699> thing<00:07:51.090> again<00:07:51.360> is<00:07:51.620> if<00:07:52.620> you

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 
accountability thing again is if you

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.749 
accountability thing again is if you
tell<00:07:52.889> people<00:07:55.099> why<00:07:56.099> we're<00:07:56.250> doing<00:07:56.340> this<00:07:56.580> you

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 
tell people why we're doing this you

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.450 
tell people why we're doing this you
know<00:07:57.169> if<00:07:58.169> you<00:07:58.349> don't<00:07:58.469> do<00:07:58.710> you'll<00:07:58.949> never<00:07:59.250> lose

00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.460 
know if you don't do you'll never lose

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.599 
know if you don't do you'll never lose
you<00:07:59.699> have<00:07:59.819> to<00:07:59.940> do<00:08:00.060> it<00:08:00.150> again<00:08:00.300> niggas
