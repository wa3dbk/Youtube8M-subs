witches I do this once his d 26w so just
enter<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.500> key<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.270> another<00:00:37.110> set<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
enter the key in and another set of

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.069 
enter the key in and another set of
weapons<00:00:37.770> will<00:00:38.129> come<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.719> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
transformation this is how I like to do

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
transformation this is how I like to do
only<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.730> would<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> start<00:00:46.230> taking<00:00:46.440> out

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

the front part here I go here that
little<00:00:50.129> weapon<00:00:50.430> gun<00:00:51.230> keep<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.350> mind<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.590> will

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
little weapon gun keep in mind this will

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
little weapon gun keep in mind this will
be<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.340> later<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:54.829> discard<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.750> here

put in the missiles just put in the
Mitchells<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.980> DZ<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.519> pushing<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
Mitchells the DZ just pushing the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.080 
Mitchells the DZ just pushing the
missiles<00:03:22.430> let's<00:03:23.430> convert<00:03:23.820> that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.240 

and<00:03:29.090> then<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:30.020> is<00:03:30.200> scattershot<00:03:30.590> heavily

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
and then this is scattershot heavily

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.930 
and then this is scattershot heavily
geared<00:03:31.550> for<00:03:31.940> fire<00:03:36.250> it's<00:03:37.250> got<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.520> head<00:03:37.700> hood

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
geared for fire it's got the head hood

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.540 
geared for fire it's got the head hood
down<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:39.819> call<00:03:40.819> for<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:41.120> cyber<00:03:41.360> planet<00:03:41.720> keeping

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
down and call for a cyber planet keeping

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.650 
down and call for a cyber planet keeping
pop<00:03:43.550> right<00:03:43.790> up<00:03:43.819> BAM<00:03:46.090> scattershot<00:03:49.000> why<00:03:50.000> I'm<00:03:50.270> 40

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
pop right up BAM scattershot why I'm 40

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.170 
pop right up BAM scattershot why I'm 40
arms<00:03:50.959> that's<00:03:51.560> illegal<00:03:51.920> scattershot<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.970> can't

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
arms that's illegal scattershot it can't

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.750 
arms that's illegal scattershot it can't
really<00:03:53.390> move<00:03:53.810> forward<00:03:54.350> it's<00:03:55.130> like<00:03:55.310> Armada

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
really move forward it's like Armada

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.240 
really move forward it's like Armada
it's<00:03:56.420> like<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.720> Armada<00:03:57.140> Megatron<00:03:57.770> they<00:03:58.010> can't

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
it's like the Armada Megatron they can't

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.180 
it's like the Armada Megatron they can't
move<00:03:58.430> forward<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.150> yeah<00:03:59.360> so<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.500> legs<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:01.010> can

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
move forward so yeah so the legs it can

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.009 
move forward so yeah so the legs it can
split<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:03.800> arms<00:04:04.190> well<00:04:04.850> there<00:04:05.209> they're<00:04:05.810> like

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
split the arms well there they're like

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.560 
split the arms well there they're like
regular<00:04:06.170> arms<00:04:06.860> were<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.430> regular<00:04:07.700> transformer

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
regular arms were a regular transformer

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.020 
regular arms were a regular transformer
so<00:04:08.780> yeah<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:10.000> this<00:04:11.000> is<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.600> missile<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:13.030> I'll

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
so yeah and this is the missile and I'll

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.800 
so yeah and this is the missile and I'll
bring<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.360> closer<00:04:14.630> just<00:04:14.930> got<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.140> shot<00:04:16.810> right

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
bring it closer just got a shot right

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.730 
bring it closer just got a shot right
here<00:04:17.840> that's<00:04:18.850> pretty<00:04:19.850> much<00:04:20.060> scattershot

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.180 

cool-looking<00:04:27.740> fear<00:04:28.150> not<00:04:29.150> my<00:04:29.330> favorite<00:04:30.070> nor<00:04:31.070> is

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
overall yeah and the arms this wheel's

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.820 
overall yeah and the arms this wheel's
also<00:04:43.820> become<00:04:44.180> minigun<00:04:44.780> sub<00:04:45.229> this<00:04:45.680> is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
also become minigun sub this is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.880 
also become minigun sub this is
scattershot<00:04:46.250> heavily<00:04:46.820> geared<00:04:47.090> for<00:04:47.360> five<00:04:47.890> have

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
scattershot heavily geared for five have

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.969 
scattershot heavily geared for five have
two<00:04:49.160> arms<00:04:49.370> out<00:04:49.669> BAM<00:04:50.330> it's<00:04:51.200> got<00:04:51.350> some<00:04:51.530> firepower

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
two arms out BAM it's got some firepower

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.710 
two arms out BAM it's got some firepower
right<00:04:52.790> there<00:04:53.090> man<00:04:54.460> split<00:04:55.460> open<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.180> yeah

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
right there man split open so yeah

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.550 
right there man split open so yeah
scatter<00:04:57.140> shot<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.710> now<00:04:58.810> time<00:04:59.810> to<00:05:00.050> transform

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
scatter shot and now time to transform

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.500 
scatter shot and now time to transform
them<00:05:00.770> back<00:05:00.979> it's<00:05:01.610> easy<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:02.870> take<00:05:03.140> out<00:05:03.380> this

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
them back it's easy just take out this

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:12.219 
them back it's easy just take out this
take<00:05:05.510> out<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.750> gun<00:05:07.570> like<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:11.110> pull<00:05:12.110> out

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
take out the gun like that pull out

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.159 
take out the gun like that pull out
those<00:05:12.470> trying<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.039> keep<00:05:13.280> pull<00:05:13.550> out<00:05:13.930> these<00:05:14.930> two

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
those trying to keep pull out these two

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.420 
those trying to keep pull out these two
muscles<00:05:15.640> closest<00:05:16.640> back<00:05:17.150> up<00:05:18.190> it's<00:05:19.190> kind<00:05:19.370> of

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
muscles closest back up it's kind of

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.810 
muscles closest back up it's kind of
easier<00:05:19.789> for<00:05:20.030> me<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.180> do<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:20.600> like<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.930> and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
easier for me to do it like that and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.279 
easier for me to do it like that and
this<00:05:22.820> is<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.120> waste<00:05:23.300> gas<00:05:23.539> shot<00:05:23.780> was<00:05:23.960> earlier

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
this is the waste gas shot was earlier

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.690 
this is the waste gas shot was earlier
that<00:05:24.950> head<00:05:25.130> I<00:05:25.160> forgot<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.970> can<00:05:26.210> rotate<00:05:27.700> it's

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
that head I forgot it can rotate it's

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.150 
that head I forgot it can rotate it's
better<00:05:28.940> than<00:05:29.120> some<00:05:29.360> heads<00:05:29.600> and<00:05:29.960> some<00:05:30.560> old<00:05:30.770> so

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
better than some heads and some old so

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.570 
better than some heads and some old so
yeah<00:05:31.450> so<00:05:32.450> first<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.930> start<00:05:33.140> off<00:05:33.320> with<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
yeah so first you start off with the
