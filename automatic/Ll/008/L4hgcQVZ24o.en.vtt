I'm pretty lucky that I got such a nice
circle<00:01:55.740> like<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.850> alright<00:01:57.090> if

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
circle like this but it's alright if

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
circle like this but it's alright if
it's<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.600> cuz<00:01:58.020> we're<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.649> mold

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's just cuz we're just gonna have mold

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.969 
it's just cuz we're just gonna have mold
it<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.369> doesn't<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> be<00:01:59.850> perfect

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
it so it doesn't have to be perfect

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.429 
it so it doesn't have to be perfect
and<00:02:01.520> now<00:02:02.299> we're<00:02:02.509> gonna<00:02:02.570> take<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.049> circle

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
and now we're gonna take the circle

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.200 
and now we're gonna take the circle
piece<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.280> put<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.549> right<00:02:04.579> over<00:02:05.090> his

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
piece and just put it right over his

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.020 
piece and just put it right over his
face<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.530> what<00:02:07.100> we're<00:02:07.219> gonna<00:02:07.310> do<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.729> try<00:02:08.000> to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
face and what we're gonna do is try to

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.540 
face and what we're gonna do is try to
mold<00:02:08.390> it<00:02:08.660> around<00:02:08.810> his<00:02:09.229> face<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.129> press<00:02:10.399> it

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
mold it around his face and press it

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.580 
mold it around his face and press it
down<00:02:10.629> there's<00:02:11.629> gonna<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.930> some<00:02:12.110> creases

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
down there's gonna be some creases

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.350 
down there's gonna be some creases
because<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.160> perfect<00:02:13.519> circle<00:02:14.000> that's<00:02:14.180> all

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
because it's a perfect circle that's all

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.790 
because it's a perfect circle that's all
right<00:02:14.450> we<00:02:14.599> just<00:02:14.750> flatten<00:02:15.050> him<00:02:15.170> out<00:02:15.290> mold<00:02:15.680> it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
right we just flatten him out mold it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.110 
right we just flatten him out mold it
mold<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.930> wallah<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.819> now<00:02:19.910> for

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
mold it and wallah all right and now for

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.990 
mold it and wallah all right and now for
the<00:02:20.180> eyes<00:02:20.390> I'm<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.110> gonna<00:02:21.200> cut<00:02:21.620> out<00:02:21.970> kind<00:02:22.970> of

like a long I hole right here in the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.259 
like a long I hole right here in the
front<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.269> he<00:02:26.300> can<00:02:26.569> see<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:28.000> luckily<00:02:29.000> he<00:02:29.150> has

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
front so he can see and luckily he has

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.130

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
all right the bat symbol is gonna be

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.379 
all right the bat symbol is gonna be
kind<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.799> tricky<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.340> need<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.670> very<00:03:11.030> flat

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
kind of tricky you need the very flat

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.240 
kind of tricky you need the very flat
pretty<00:03:11.690> thin<00:03:11.989> piece<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> play-doh<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:12.799> what<00:03:13.220> I

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
pretty thin piece of play-doh and what I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.490 
pretty thin piece of play-doh and what I
did<00:03:13.549> is<00:03:13.670> did<00:03:13.880> little<00:03:14.120> markings<00:03:14.660> at<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.109> tips

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
did is did little markings at the tips

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.699 
did is did little markings at the tips
of<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:16.010> points<00:03:16.549> of<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.269> bat<00:03:17.420> symbol<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.170> what

of the points of the bat symbol and what

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.289 
of the points of the bat symbol and what
I<00:03:18.769> do<00:03:18.859> is<00:03:19.100> kind<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.489> connect<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> dots

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
I do is kind of like connect the dots

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.180 
I do is kind of like connect the dots
that<00:03:20.690> seems<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.350> easiest<00:03:21.680> way<00:03:21.889> to<00:03:21.920> do

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
that seems to be the easiest way to do

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.099 
that seems to be the easiest way to do
it<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.060> pretty<00:03:23.299> tricky<00:03:23.630> though<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.019> you

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
it it is pretty tricky though so you

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.160 
it it is pretty tricky though so you
just<00:03:24.290> gotta<00:03:24.440> follow<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.579> lines<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.630> connect

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
just gotta follow the lines and connect

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.470 
just gotta follow the lines and connect
all<00:03:27.319> the<00:03:27.500> dots<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.040> just<00:03:28.850> make<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.150> curves

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
all the dots and just make the curves

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.920 
all the dots and just make the curves
and<00:03:30.230> once<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.250> make<00:03:31.430> those<00:03:31.579> dots<00:03:31.880> in<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and once you make those dots in the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.240 
and once you make those dots in the
order<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.380> should<00:03:33.410> be<00:03:33.590> pretty<00:03:33.769> easy

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
order it should be pretty easy

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.210 
order it should be pretty easy

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
and here is our bat symbol I am actually

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.440 
and here is our bat symbol I am actually
very<00:03:47.150> surprised<00:03:47.840> how<00:03:48.170> well<00:03:48.440> this<00:03:48.680> turned<00:03:48.950> out
