00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
really quickly not upon application but

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.720 
really quickly not upon application but
actually<00:00:21.020> in<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.290> jar<00:00:21.560> where<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.310> product

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
actually in the jar where the product

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.690 
actually in the jar where the product
starts<00:00:23.060> pulling<00:00:23.360> away<00:00:23.540> from<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.050> jar<00:00:24.320> well<00:00:25.220> I

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
starts pulling away from the jar well I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.490 
starts pulling away from the jar well I
actually<00:00:26.090> have<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.420> solution<00:00:26.750> for<00:00:26.990> you

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
actually have a solution for you

so the slight benefit creases cream
shadow<00:00:30.440> and<00:00:30.770> it<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.550> in<00:00:32.270> our<00:00:33.250> SVP<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:35.329> had

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
shadow and it is in our SVP and I had

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.660 
shadow and it is in our SVP and I had
this<00:00:35.720> for<00:00:36.050> almost<00:00:36.680> two<00:00:36.950> years<00:00:36.980> now

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
this for almost two years now

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.090 
this for almost two years now
anyway<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.630> used<00:00:38.840> a<00:00:38.989> lot<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:39.710> can<00:00:39.860> kind

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
anyway so I used a lot and you can kind

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.000 
anyway so I used a lot and you can kind
of<00:00:40.130> see<00:00:40.400> that<00:00:41.239> it<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:42.170> pulling<00:00:42.500> away<00:00:42.680> from<00:00:42.800> the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
of see that it is pulling away from the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.850 
of see that it is pulling away from the
edges<00:00:43.489> of<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.730> pot<00:00:43.970> well<00:00:44.899> what<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:45.530> need<00:00:45.739> to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
edges of the pot well what you need to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.720 
edges of the pot well what you need to
do<00:00:45.980> is<00:00:47.079> take<00:00:48.079> some<00:00:48.140> mac<00:00:48.950> fix+

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
do is take some mac fix+

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.600 
do is take some mac fix+
so<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:50.210> have<00:00:50.450> this<00:00:50.600> in<00:00:50.840> rows<00:00:51.309> just<00:00:52.329> spritz<00:00:54.610> and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
so I have this in rows just spritz and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.209 
so I have this in rows just spritz and
it's<00:00:55.790> kind<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.090> watery<00:00:56.680> may-who<00:00:57.680> most<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.130> it

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
it's kind of watery may-who most of it

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.220 
it's kind of watery may-who most of it
will<00:00:58.370> dry<00:00:58.640> up<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.030> then<00:00:59.210> my<00:00:59.660> hands<00:00:59.960> are<00:01:00.079> clean

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
will dry up and then my hands are clean

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.970 
will dry up and then my hands are clean
so<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.250> start<00:01:01.670> looking<00:01:01.700> mixing<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.840> if<00:01:03.649> you

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
so you start looking mixing it in if you

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.380 
so you start looking mixing it in if you
use<00:01:04.129> these<00:01:04.250> products<00:01:04.699> as<00:01:04.850> an<00:01:05.210> eyeshadow

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
use these products as an eyeshadow

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.249 
use these products as an eyeshadow
primer<00:01:06.069> it's<00:01:07.069> not<00:01:07.939> going<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:09.280> be<00:01:10.280> as

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
primer it's not going to be as

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.749 
primer it's not going to be as
long-lasting<00:01:12.259> or<00:01:12.560> prevent<00:01:13.369> any<00:01:13.579> creasing

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
long-lasting or prevent any creasing

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.340 
long-lasting or prevent any creasing
like<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.240> used<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.539> just<00:01:14.630> because<00:01:15.170> you're

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
like it used to just because you're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.949 
like it used to just because you're
adding<00:01:15.850> other<00:01:16.850> ingredients<00:01:17.060> such<00:01:17.899> as

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:17.959 
adding other ingredients such as

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.279 
adding other ingredients such as
glycerin<00:01:18.499> into<00:01:19.249> the<00:01:19.369> product<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.539> it<00:01:20.869> won't<00:01:21.049> be

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
glycerin into the product so it won't be

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.709 
glycerin into the product so it won't be
as<00:01:22.869> effective<00:01:24.700> yes<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:25.999> this<00:01:26.119> is<00:01:26.240> pretty<00:01:26.479> gross

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
as effective yes so this is pretty gross

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.599 
as effective yes so this is pretty gross
how<00:01:26.959> you<00:01:27.020> guys<00:01:27.200> are<00:01:27.319> watching<00:01:27.439> me<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:27.889> this<00:01:28.069> but

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
how you guys are watching me do this but

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.849 
how you guys are watching me do this but
if<00:01:28.819> you<00:01:28.969> have<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.179> spatula<00:01:29.569> or<00:01:30.170> anything<00:01:30.439> that

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
if you have a spatula or anything that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.919 
if you have a spatula or anything that
would<00:01:31.399> work<00:01:31.609> too<00:01:33.849> so<00:01:34.849> yeah<00:01:34.969> so<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.450> reason<00:01:35.779> why

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
would work too so yeah so the reason why

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.569

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.059 
know melts right into the product I
probably<00:02:02.599> spritz<00:02:03.169> a<00:02:03.289> bit<00:02:03.439> too<00:02:03.649> much<00:02:03.829> but

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
probably spritz a bit too much but

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.669 
probably spritz a bit too much but
that's<00:02:04.459> alright<00:02:05.109> that's<00:02:06.109> right<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.529> just

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
that's alright that's right you just

want to work it into the product so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.870 
want to work it into the product so
looks<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.560> bit<00:02:09.590> gross<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.840> kasi<00:02:12.410> it's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
looks a bit gross but it's in kasi it's

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.400 
looks a bit gross but it's in kasi it's
less<00:02:13.880> pulling<00:02:14.330> away<00:02:14.420> from<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.780> edges<00:02:15.140> than<00:02:15.320> it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
less pulling away from the edges than it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.200 
less pulling away from the edges than it
was<00:02:15.500> both

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
was both

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.740 
was both
all<00:02:17.210> right<00:02:17.390> I'm<00:02:18.200> going<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.500> actually<00:02:18.680> flank
