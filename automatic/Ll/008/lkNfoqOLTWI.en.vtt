struggling the first half to get a foot
all<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> game<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.799> know<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:05.010> ball<00:04:05.190> went

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
all in the game you know the ball went

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.740 
all in the game you know the ball went
to<00:04:05.459> take<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.609> few<00:04:05.819> times<00:04:06.030> when<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.540> would<00:04:06.630> have

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
to take a few times when we would have

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.809 
to take a few times when we would have
expected<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.230> keep<00:04:07.380> all<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.829> so<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.700> know

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
expected to keep all of it so you know

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.250 
expected to keep all of it so you know
we<00:04:09.120> improved<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.599> little<00:04:09.660> bit<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:09.930> secondary

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
we improved a little bit in secondary

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.539 
we improved a little bit in secondary
terms<00:04:10.590> or<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> ball<00:04:10.889> retention<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.430> our

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
terms or a ball retention in our

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.009 
terms or a ball retention in our
intensity<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.269> suppose<00:04:12.510> ultimately<00:04:12.870> if

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
intensity and I suppose ultimately if

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.960 
intensity and I suppose ultimately if
that<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.230> true<00:04:13.549> castleknock<00:04:14.549> looked<00:04:14.849> like

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
that is true castleknock looked like

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.339 
that is true castleknock looked like

you were able to work around over the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.150 
you were able to work around over the
last<00:04:18.150> ten<00:04:18.359> minutes<00:04:18.479> of<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.780> first<00:04:18.930> half<00:04:19.160> yeah
