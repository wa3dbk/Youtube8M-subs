moment but first we're going to use
thunder<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:51.350> fujin<00:01:52.350> tonics<00:01:53.210> actually<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> was

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
thunder or fujin tonics actually I was

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.520 
thunder or fujin tonics actually I was
debating<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.720> whether<00:01:54.869> used<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.229> flute<00:01:55.439> or

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
debating on whether used the flute or

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.679 
debating on whether used the flute or
not<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.430> was<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.909> should<00:01:56.939> i<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.600> or

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
not and I was like you should i do it or

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.020 
not and I was like you should i do it or
try<00:01:57.810> not<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.649> no<00:01:59.369> nose<00:01:59.700> like

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
try not do it I'm like no nose like

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
try not do it I'm like no nose like
should<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.420> better<00:02:00.570> safe<00:02:00.840> than<00:02:00.960> sorry<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.590> i

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
should I be better safe than sorry so i

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
should I be better safe than sorry so i
chose<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> better<00:02:02.670> safe<00:02:02.909> than<00:02:03.060> sorry<00:02:03.119> route

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
chose the better safe than sorry route

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.440 
chose the better safe than sorry route
because<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
because I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.670 
because I
tons<00:02:04.659> of<00:02:04.719> them<00:02:04.780> anyways<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.409> didn't<00:02:05.649> really

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
tons of them anyways so it didn't really

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.010 
tons of them anyways so it didn't really
matter<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:07.000> we're<00:02:07.090> gonna<00:02:07.180> use<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.659> fuji<00:02:07.869> ins

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
matter so we're gonna use the fuji ins

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.360 
matter so we're gonna use the fuji ins
on<00:02:08.289> all<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.489> fighters<00:02:09.670> except<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.179> one<00:02:10.360> Maxwell

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
on all the fighters except a one Maxwell

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.750 
on all the fighters except a one Maxwell
cuz<00:02:12.370> want<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.360> extra<00:02:13.569> lightning<00:02:14.110> damage<00:02:14.319> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
cuz want that extra lightning damage and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.640 
cuz want that extra lightning damage and
save<00:02:15.760> improved<00:02:16.090> elixirs<00:02:16.450> got<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.170> thunder<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
save improved elixirs got to thunder so

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.869 
save improved elixirs got to thunder so
we<00:02:17.709> reuse<00:02:17.920> loaded<00:02:18.220> first<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> get<00:02:18.670> to

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
we reuse loaded first to get to

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.940 
we reuse loaded first to get to
lightning<00:02:19.390> element<00:02:19.720> up<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.470> Maxwell's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
lightning element up with to Maxwell's

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.640 
lightning element up with to Maxwell's
and<00:02:21.280> weenies<00:02:21.580> Maxwell<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:23.349> starts

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
and weenies Maxwell and it starts

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.199 
and weenies Maxwell and it starts
lagging<00:02:23.830> as<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.160> forgot<00:02:24.519> to<00:02:24.670> turn<00:02:24.790> off<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
lagging as I forgot to turn off the

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.589 
lagging as I forgot to turn off the
settings<00:02:25.650> which<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.769> need<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.040> fix<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.790> then

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
settings which I need to fix and then

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.509 
settings which I need to fix and then
obviously<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.500> continue<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.099> rest<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
obviously just continue with the rest of

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.259 
obviously just continue with the rest of
the<00:02:30.880> lightning<00:02:31.239> units<00:02:31.569> and<00:02:32.819> just<00:02:33.819> destroy

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
the lightning units and just destroy

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.330 
the lightning units and just destroy
them<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.620> wait<00:02:35.799> a<00:02:35.920> little<00:02:36.040> bit<00:02:36.190> for

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
them and then I wait a little bit for

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.680 
them and then I wait a little bit for
Maxwell<00:02:36.790> here<00:02:37.000> because<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.209> just<00:02:37.390> want<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.569> see

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
Maxwell here because I just want to see

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.680 
Maxwell here because I just want to see
phia<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:39.340> want<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.580> pop<00:02:40.180> him<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.420> there<00:02:40.630> at

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
phia just want to pop him in there at

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.690 
phia just want to pop him in there at
the<00:02:40.810> end<00:02:40.959> I'm<00:02:41.560> hands<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.040> attacking<00:02:42.310> Omega

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
the end I'm hands up attacking Omega

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.580 
the end I'm hands up attacking Omega
which<00:02:43.569> you'll<00:02:43.720> find<00:02:43.750> on<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.019> moment<00:02:44.440> cuz

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
which you'll find on a moment cuz

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.839 
which you'll find on a moment cuz
everyone<00:02:44.890> dies<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.099> make<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.549> still<00:02:45.730> there

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
everyone dies and make it still there

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.830 
everyone dies and make it still there
cuz<00:02:46.120> he's<00:02:46.420> still<00:02:46.840> slowly<00:02:47.260> attacking<00:02:47.860> mega

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
cuz he's still slowly attacking mega

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.080 
cuz he's still slowly attacking mega
he's<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.019> an<00:02:50.200> HEC<00:02:50.620> giving<00:02:50.860> dan<00:02:51.010> yeah<00:02:51.819> give<00:02:52.000> me

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
he's like an HEC giving dan yeah give me

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.720 
he's like an HEC giving dan yeah give me
then<00:02:52.269> you're<00:02:52.599> dead<00:02:52.810> brah<00:02:53.049> totally<00:02:53.769> did<00:02:53.920> so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
then you're dead brah totally did so

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.319 
then you're dead brah totally did so
they're<00:02:54.880> all<00:02:55.000> dead<00:02:55.209> here<00:02:56.940> man<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:57.970> can't

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
they're all dead here man I can't

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.390 
they're all dead here man I can't
believe<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.569> in<00:02:58.630> record<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:59.230> did<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.530> facetime

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
believe it in record I did the facetime

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.370 
believe it in record I did the facetime
I<00:03:00.670> did<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:00.940> face<00:03:01.180> too<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.780> everything<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.290> it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
I did the face too and everything in it

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.440 
I did the face too and everything in it
I<00:03:02.590> don't<00:03:03.310> know<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.549> happened<00:03:03.579> it's<00:03:04.360> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
I don't know what happened it's the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.699 
I don't know what happened it's the
first<00:03:04.569> video<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.900> recorded<00:03:04.930> since<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.530> got<00:03:05.680> back

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
first video I recorded since I got back

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.410 
first video I recorded since I got back
so<00:03:06.930> very<00:03:07.930> Omega<00:03:08.380> dies<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.940> second<00:03:10.269> fight

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
so very Omega dies so the second fight

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.520 
so very Omega dies so the second fight
can<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.870> little<00:03:11.049> bit<00:03:11.200> more<00:03:11.380> difficult

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
can be a little bit more difficult

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.020 
can be a little bit more difficult
because<00:03:12.459> lucena<00:03:13.030> can<00:03:13.569> add<00:03:14.459> earth<00:03:15.459> element

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
because lucena can add earth element

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.470 
because lucena can add earth element
basically<00:03:16.569> from<00:03:16.989> what<00:03:17.109> i<00:03:17.139> remember<00:03:17.290> reading

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
basically from what i remember reading

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.030 
basically from what i remember reading
so<00:03:19.480> make<00:03:19.840> sure<00:03:19.870> i<00:03:20.019> want<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> take<00:03:20.440> her<00:03:20.560> out<00:03:20.739> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
so make sure i want to take her out the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.670 
so make sure i want to take her out the
first<00:03:21.340> turn<00:03:21.579> which<00:03:21.819> I<00:03:22.359> want<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.930> use<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.290> thunder

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
first turn which I want to use a thunder

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.039 
first turn which I want to use a thunder
or<00:03:23.799> for<00:03:24.250> brute<00:03:24.549> elixirs<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.540> Holy<00:03:25.720> flute

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
or for brute elixirs in the Holy flute

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.360 
or for brute elixirs in the Holy flute
is<00:03:26.350> what<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.560> definitely<00:03:26.859> only<00:03:27.010> use<00:03:27.220> because
