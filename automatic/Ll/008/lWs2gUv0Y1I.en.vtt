whatsoever when we fall we can form
opportune<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.240> crazy<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:28.020> kilonewtons

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
opportune it's crazy to kilonewtons

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.390 
opportune it's crazy to kilonewtons
economy<00:03:29.580> kinetic<00:03:30.090> that's<00:03:30.320> 2.0<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.220> way<00:03:32.370> a

harness<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:33.060> designed<00:03:33.420> all<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.500> energy<00:03:34.830> goes

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
harness is designed all the energy goes

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.800 
harness is designed all the energy goes
into<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.550> back<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> gets<00:03:36.300> dissipated

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
into the back and it gets dissipated

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.380 
into the back and it gets dissipated
around<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.470> harness<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.160> ends<00:03:38.430> up<00:03:38.550> in<00:03:38.850> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
around the harness and it ends up in the

kilonewtons<00:03:45.510> my<00:03:46.200> harness<00:03:46.530> will<00:03:47.340> line<00:03:47.760> up

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
kilonewtons my harness will line up

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.550 
kilonewtons my harness will line up
straight<00:03:49.110> into<00:03:49.800> my<00:03:49.890> core<00:03:50.100> area<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.820> this<00:03:51.560> now
