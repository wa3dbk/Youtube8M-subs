why I chose Katerina but if you all you
can<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.360> check<00:00:15.599> out<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:16.410> they've<00:00:16.770> sort<00:00:16.980> of

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
can just check out there they've sort of

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.689 
can just check out there they've sort of
pros<00:00:17.810> there<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> cons<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.460> want

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
pros there are the cons but if you want

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.359 
pros there are the cons but if you want
to<00:00:20.820> wash<00:00:21.060> isn't<00:00:21.449> high<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.990> list<00:00:22.289> well<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to wash isn't high on this list well of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.130 
to wash isn't high on this list well of
course<00:00:23.400> because<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> only<00:00:24.240> controller<00:00:24.930> has

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
course because the only controller has

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
course because the only controller has
is<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.580> CC<00:00:27.119> then<00:00:27.599> you're

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
is that if they have CC then you're

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.380 
is that if they have CC then you're
useless<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:29.039> most<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> time<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:30.150> have

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
useless but most of the time they have

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.350 
useless but most of the time they have
CC<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:31.380> your<00:00:31.619> support<00:00:32.130> Amsterdam<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.969> support

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
CC if your support Amsterdam you support

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.959 
CC if your support Amsterdam you support
but<00:00:33.719> maybe<00:00:33.960> also<00:00:34.079> mid<00:00:34.559> laner<00:00:34.820> jungle<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but maybe also mid laner jungle and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.780 
but maybe also mid laner jungle and
whatnot<00:00:36.690> toppling<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.770> if<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.430> CC

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
whatnot toppling and if they have CC

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.819 
whatnot toppling and if they have CC
they<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.300> stun<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> kill<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they can just stun you and kill you so

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
they can just stun you and kill you so
that's<00:00:41.010> why<00:00:41.219> Katarina<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.090> higher<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that's why Katarina is in higher on this

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.470 
that's why Katarina is in higher on this
list<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.680> fourth<00:00:43.980> spot<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.670> got<00:00:44.910> bled<00:00:45.210> man

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
list but the fourth spot we got bled man

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.479 
list but the fourth spot we got bled man
the<00:00:45.840> black<00:00:46.110> math<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> real<00:00:46.829> strong<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.460> now

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the black math is real strong right now

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.330 
the black math is real strong right now
well<00:00:48.270> why<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.719> strong<00:00:49.050> as<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.070> see

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
well why is it strong as you can see

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
well why is it strong as you can see
that<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:51.059> deals<00:00:51.989> incredible<00:00:52.949> amount<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that I'm deals incredible amount of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.720 
that I'm deals incredible amount of
damage<00:00:53.730> licking<00:00:54.510> yes<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.410> sting<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.039> strong

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
damage licking yes is sting a strong

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
damage licking yes is sting a strong
wave<00:00:56.969> cliff<00:00:57.329> doesn't<00:00:57.840> use<00:00:58.109> man<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
wave cliff doesn't use man and it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.080 
wave cliff doesn't use man and it's
pretty<00:00:59.550> hard<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.879> gank<00:01:00.210> dope<00:01:01.020> discounts<00:01:01.890> no<00:01:02.520> CC

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
pretty hard to gank dope discounts no CC

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.590 
pretty hard to gank dope discounts no CC

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you haven't tried them for some reason

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.600 
you haven't tried them for some reason
then<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.570> ahead<00:01:15.750> he's<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.439> good<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.400> at<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
then go ahead he's really good so at the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.780 
then go ahead he's really good so at the
third<00:01:17.850> spot<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.720> zip<00:01:19.110> did<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.130> really

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
third spot it got zip did it just really

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
third spot it got zip did it just really
strong<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.259> never<00:01:22.619> gone

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
strong right now so I really never gone

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.530 
strong right now so I really never gone
middling<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.490> i<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.939> boring<00:01:24.180> but

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
middling because i think it's boring but

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
middling because i think it's boring but
with<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.350> everything<00:01:26.100> becomes<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.610> fun

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it's very hard to use the shadows but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.890 
it's very hard to use the shadows but
when<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> learn<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.060> mean<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.570> really
