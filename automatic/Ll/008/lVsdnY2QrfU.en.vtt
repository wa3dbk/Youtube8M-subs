00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
because uh because I think that's a I

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.029 
because uh because I think that's a I
think<00:06:01.379> that<00:06:01.620> is<00:06:01.830> very<00:06:02.069> interesting<00:06:03.680> it's<00:06:04.680> key

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
think that is very interesting it's key

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.670 
think that is very interesting it's key
though<00:06:05.310> it's<00:06:05.699> key<00:06:06.029> though<00:06:06.300> that<00:06:06.599> the<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:07.409> the

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
though it's key though that the the the

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.249 
though it's key though that the the the
watch<00:06:07.949> and<00:06:08.669> this<00:06:08.909> is<00:06:09.060> something<00:06:09.210> most<00:06:09.569> watches

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
watch and this is something most watches

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.869 
watch and this is something most watches
don't<00:06:10.439> do<00:06:10.680> some<00:06:10.949> of<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.099> Samsung's<00:06:11.520> do<00:06:11.699> I

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
don't do some of the Samsung's do I

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.510 
don't do some of the Samsung's do I
think<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:13.020> ability<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.439> take<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:14.099> phone<00:06:14.310> call

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
think the ability to take the phone call

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.029 
think the ability to take the phone call
on<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.729> watch<00:06:14.939> is<00:06:15.120> interesting<00:06:15.779> so<00:06:16.740> then<00:06:16.919> you

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
on the watch is interesting so then you

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.800 
on the watch is interesting so then you
really<00:06:17.460> can<00:06:17.729> do<00:06:17.909> everything<00:06:18.180> on<00:06:18.419> those<00:06:18.539> so<00:06:18.779> I

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
really can do everything on those so I

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.029 
really can do everything on those so I
mean<00:06:19.050> you<00:06:19.139> wouldn't<00:06:19.319> want<00:06:19.439> to<00:06:19.589> spend<00:06:19.800> a<00:06:19.860> lot<00:06:19.979> of

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
mean you wouldn't want to spend a lot of

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.339 
mean you wouldn't want to spend a lot of
time<00:06:20.339> on<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.699> but<00:06:21.270> if<00:06:21.419> you<00:06:21.629> want<00:06:21.839> a<00:06:21.900> quick<00:06:22.110> like
