00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
touch structure green computer so I'll

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.770 
touch structure green computer so I'll
this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.440> easy<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.920> me<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.570> first<00:00:57.570> what

this is really easy for me so first what

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.360 
this is really easy for me so first what
we<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> install<00:00:59.309> the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
it's actually working so I haven't

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.530 
it's actually working so I haven't
exactly<00:02:12.440> installed<00:02:13.340> everything<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:13.970> my<00:02:14.210> phone

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
exactly installed everything on my phone

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.750 
exactly installed everything on my phone
or<00:02:15.380> on<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.830> BlueStacks<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.000> run<00:02:17.420> games<00:02:18.050> yet

or on to BlueStacks for to run games yet

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.930 
or on to BlueStacks for to run games yet
so<00:02:22.390> we<00:02:23.390> basically<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:25.459> wanted<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
so we basically do so if we wanted to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.789 
so we basically do so if we wanted to
stop<00:02:26.209> it

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:44.430 

is<00:02:32.799> that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.750 

just<00:02:45.100> click<00:02:45.340> close<00:02:46.920> close<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.160> game<00:02:48.370> and

on next mod games this might be my only
one<00:07:22.230> this<00:07:23.010> is<00:07:23.220> the<00:07:23.370> best<00:07:23.580> way<00:07:23.790> of<00:07:23.820> doing<00:07:24.120> it<00:07:24.390> and

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
one this is the best way of doing it and

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.460 
one this is the best way of doing it and
hopefully<00:07:26.970> that<00:07:27.360> this<00:07:27.510> was<00:07:27.690> easier<00:07:28.110> because<00:07:28.320> I

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
hopefully that this was easier because I

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.360 
hopefully that this was easier because I
