00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello everyone here kneading chain continues domenech reminding their 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.980
 hobbies as 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.960
 today I'm explaining to you how bad it was to two hours to 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.719
 0% buffer on mac 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.580
 so I give it a mode and that allows to install other modes later 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.390
 it's a match that does not require any modification in the game but that allows 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.730
 in those years and the mode that will work that if we have less 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 year old stanley in france was going toothache on 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.400
 mats sundin for a pretty process 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.110
 different than on pc 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.860
 it's beautiful that made you buy to individuals 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.590
 I will first download 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.000
 in the first step you have downloaded extra furniture from ilfc 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 a registered on the other hand the industry here it is 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.910
 so we did it so far 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.920
 bush to archive 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.560
 for having poorly measured the dirt road and inside you have 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.980
 points as many place point files so these are the world files 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.540
 then we'll have to start terminal so if she remembered 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.370
 utility applications 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.150
 terminal here 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.940
 get started 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.130
 and we will have to type 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.330
 peeled the lines the member schools of the site 610000 in the tutorial but line 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 by line 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.580
 to resume flights departing from m if if I advise you to copy paste 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.680
 every time the commands are 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680
 it is faster 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 m 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.970
 ap 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.980
 in fact inside 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 then you do not have to leave the terminal 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.580
 but you will have to move 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.480
 all the files by class in a folder that has just been created 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.580
 so it's called mc 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.700
 it has risen so it means even cartel if I suppose 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.189
 and inside you will go over all the files you have for 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.499
 recover in the folder of the vertical archives malouda principle 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.279
 for the first flights is exceeded 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 that's how I see it replaced if necessary 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.319
 we will arrange all that 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.669
 you can close both folders 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:25.609
 we will return the time the terminal of fos type the lines of commands 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.009
 remaining 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.009
 here 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.899
 m 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.229
 m 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.029
 m 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.800
 so now you're done installing 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.089
 butter ball on your good typing 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.459
 so to do this move my guitar 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.729
 here 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.729
 if in the folder 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.930
 otherwise bible of these deputies changed except for a strike 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.769
 you have the new files that will be created for them with Iran as no 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.079
 less than two hours late in the duels 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.629
 here is my point of desist from their context and points away 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.360
 which means that we have well preserved euro furniture received in 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:21.239
 least believe 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.559
 I repeat you soft in the busy no change 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.849
 view the delicious taste in your kraft hand that just allows by 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.849
 following install other modes 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.269
 so here's a quote that sexual crimes pursue and start the bad ones 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.360
 odors on thugs is understood 5 0 less 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.190
 and all this on a match
