because<00:01:28.409> there's<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.280> too<00:01:29.490> many<00:01:29.579> cars<00:01:30.000> over

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
because there's not too many cars over

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.819 
because there's not too many cars over
there<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.509> they<00:01:30.570> won't<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.229> soon<00:01:31.470> so

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
there and they won't see you as soon so

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
there and they won't see you as soon so
that's<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.490> first<00:01:32.520> little<00:01:32.939> toughen

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that's that's the first little toughen

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.550 
that's that's the first little toughen
the<00:01:33.360> second<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.869> tip<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.320> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the second little tip is actually a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
the second little tip is actually a
really<00:01:34.979> interesting<00:01:35.100> ramp<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> found

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really interesting ramp that I found

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
really interesting ramp that I found
that<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.530> into<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that you can actually get into the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.380 
that you can actually get into the
airport<00:01:38.460> base<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.060> more

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
airport base a little bit more

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
airport base a little bit more
inconspicuously<00:01:40.350> snow<00:01:40.920> you're<00:01:41.310> gonna<00:01:41.400> need<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
inconspicuously snow you're gonna need a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
inconspicuously snow you're gonna need a
fast<00:01:41.880> car<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.020> do

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
fast car for this and what you don't do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
fast car for this and what you don't do
is<00:01:43.350> come<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> interstate<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.310> instead<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
is come on the interstate and instead of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.100 
is come on the interstate and instead of
turning<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> road<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.960> go

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
turning it to the road right there to go

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.569 
turning it to the road right there to go
you<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.799> want<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> come<00:01:47.159> towards<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you don't want to come towards the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.830 
you don't want to come towards the
tunnel<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.060> once<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.420> at<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> tunnel

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
tunnel and once you're at the tunnel

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.600 
tunnel and once you're at the tunnel
you're<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.259> want<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> immediately<00:01:50.130> look<00:01:50.460> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you're gonna want to immediately look to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
you're gonna want to immediately look to
the<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.180> there's<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.450> hill<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:52.229> if

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the right and there's this hill now if

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
the right and there's this hill now if
you<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:52.920> you'll<00:01:53.399> actually<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:53.850> over

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you get it right you'll actually go over

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389 
you get it right you'll actually go over
the<00:01:54.329> fence<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.590> use<00:01:55.860> Franklin's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the fence and now I just use Franklin's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.920 
the fence and now I just use Franklin's
ability<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:56.969> obviously<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.630> puts<00:01:57.869> you

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
ability because obviously that puts you

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.630 
ability because obviously that puts you
on<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> ground<00:01:58.320> faster<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.399> more

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
on the ground faster and have more

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
on the ground faster and have more
control<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> car<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> don't<00:02:01.259> slam

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
control of the car so you don't slam

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.139 
control of the car so you don't slam
into<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.159> tower<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.000> right

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
into that that tower you that right

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.700 
into that that tower you that right
there<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.689> once<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.049> here<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.560> come

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there but once you get here you can come

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.149 
there but once you get here you can come
and<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.369> only<00:02:05.610> have

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
into the base without having any stars

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.930 
into the base without having any stars
you<00:02:26.680> can<00:02:26.769> do<00:02:26.890> whatever<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.250> want<00:02:27.430> there<00:02:27.610> Rob

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
even moving they're not flinching I

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.339 
even moving they're not flinching I
don't<00:03:18.519> even<00:03:18.639> think<00:03:18.760> anybody's<00:03:19.359> here<00:03:19.780> because

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
don't even think anybody's here because

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.960 
don't even think anybody's here because
what<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> notice<00:03:21.069> is<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.190> when<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.519> did<00:03:21.790> this

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
what I notice is that when you did this

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.759 
what I notice is that when you did this
mission<00:03:22.359> cuz<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.599> actually<00:03:22.690> got<00:03:22.989> stranded<00:03:23.650> in

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
mission cuz I actually got stranded in

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.800 
mission cuz I actually got stranded in
the<00:03:23.829> middle<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.160> room<00:03:24.599> nothing<00:03:25.599> really

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
the middle of the room nothing really

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.319 
the middle of the room nothing really
happens<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.620> world<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.400> don't<00:03:27.790> know<00:03:27.910> as

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
happens in the world so I don't know as

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.370 
happens in the world so I don't know as
you<00:03:28.540> saw<00:03:28.630> there<00:03:28.720> was<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.870> tank<00:03:29.109> down<00:03:29.200> there<00:03:29.349> I

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
you saw there was a tank down there I

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.229 
you saw there was a tank down there I
think<00:03:29.470> maybe<00:03:29.919> they<00:03:30.190> have<00:03:30.489> something<00:03:30.790> coded

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
think maybe they have something coded

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.849 
think maybe they have something coded
where<00:03:31.389> it<00:03:31.569> like<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.019> stuff<00:03:32.260> sort<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.530> stops

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
where it like the stuff sort of stops

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.710 
where it like the stuff sort of stops
when<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.190> do<00:03:33.489> missions<00:03:33.880> I'm<00:03:34.180> not<00:03:34.329> too<00:03:34.480> sure

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
when you do missions I'm not too sure

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.870 
when you do missions I'm not too sure
but<00:03:35.049> as<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.560> see<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.980> tank<00:03:36.220> didn't<00:03:36.459> notice<00:03:36.760> me

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
but as you see the tank didn't notice me

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.610 
but as you see the tank didn't notice me
the<00:03:37.030> jet<00:03:37.299> didn't<00:03:37.540> notice<00:03:37.750> me<00:03:37.900> there's<00:03:38.380> another

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.659 
ec130 we brought it to the airfield
where<00:04:04.060> a<00:04:04.120> hangar<00:04:04.480> was<00:04:04.660> but<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.680> didn't<00:04:06.129> fit<00:04:06.370> in

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
where a hangar was but it didn't fit in

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.059 
where a hangar was but it didn't fit in
the<00:04:06.819> hangar<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.690> we<00:04:07.930> couldn't<00:04:08.200> keep<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.650> but<00:04:08.919> we

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
the hangar so we couldn't keep it but we

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.289 
the hangar so we couldn't keep it but we
did<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.280> again<00:04:09.400> with<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.730> jet<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.120> might

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
did it again with the jet and I might

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.849 
did it again with the jet and I might
show<00:04:10.480> some<00:04:10.660> footage<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.349> we

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
show some footage of that and we

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.920 
show some footage of that and we
actually<00:04:12.040> had<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.340> keep<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.669> so<00:04:12.879> now<00:04:13.329> in<00:04:13.660> my

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
actually had to keep it so now in my

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.129 
actually had to keep it so now in my
playthrough<00:04:14.320> Trevor<00:04:15.190> has<00:04:15.489> a

to actually get the ac-130 really are

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.550 
to actually get the ac-130 really are
the<00:04:23.999> easiest<00:04:24.389> way<00:04:24.629> that<00:04:24.659> I<00:04:24.810> found<00:04:25.110> these<00:04:25.349> I'm

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
the easiest way that I found these I'm

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.839 
the easiest way that I found these I'm
going<00:04:25.680> besides<00:04:25.949> this<00:04:26.219> way<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.789> said

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
going besides this way but like I said

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.209 
going besides this way but like I said
if<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.419> do<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.629> this<00:04:27.749> way<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:28.289> don't<00:04:28.650> know<00:04:28.979> of<00:04:29.129> a

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
if you do it this way I don't know of a

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:30.469 
if you do it this way I don't know of a
way<00:04:29.310> because<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.639> don't<00:04:29.699> think<00:04:30.029> you<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.270> buy

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
way because I don't think you can buy

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.659 
way because I don't think you can buy
another<00:04:30.719> hangar<00:04:31.110> with<00:04:31.319> Trevor<00:04:31.620> maybe<00:04:32.249> you<00:04:32.430> can

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
another hangar with Trevor maybe you can

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.670 
another hangar with Trevor maybe you can
I<00:04:32.909> haven't<00:04:33.150> gotten<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.629> maybe<00:04:33.900> if<00:04:34.169> if<00:04:34.439> you

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
I haven't gotten to that maybe if if you

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.890 
I haven't gotten to that maybe if if you
can<00:04:34.949> but<00:04:35.249> this<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.300> only<00:04:36.419> way<00:04:36.569> no<00:04:36.719> like<00:04:36.840> I

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900

into a problem this plane is about as

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.230 
into a problem this plane is about as

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
this with Trevor and this way at least

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.050 
this with Trevor and this way at least
obviously<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.400> just<00:05:05.490> go<00:05:05.639> in<00:05:05.729> there<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:05.849> still

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
obviously you just go in there and still

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.969 
obviously you just go in there and still

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
it straight up with them but this way I

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.760 
it straight up with them but this way I
don't<00:05:08.370> think<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.789> ac-130<00:05:09.509> is<00:05:09.870> gonna<00:05:10.529> actually

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
don't think the ac-130 is gonna actually

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.700 
don't think the ac-130 is gonna actually
work<00:05:11.400> you<00:05:12.270> know<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.509> I<00:05:12.629> said<00:05:12.900> since<00:05:13.529> you

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
work you know like I said since you

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.010 
work you know like I said since you
can't<00:05:13.979> do<00:05:14.099> this<00:05:14.219> with<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.550> ac-130<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.870> can

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
can't do this with the ac-130 you can

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.390 
can't do this with the ac-130 you can
come<00:05:16.199> over<00:05:16.289> here<00:05:16.439> and<00:05:16.589> either<00:05:17.129> get<00:05:17.279> the
