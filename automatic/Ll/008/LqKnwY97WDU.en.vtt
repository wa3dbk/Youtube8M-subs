here lower sdv i should say up in the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.220 
here lower sdv i should say up in the
mountains<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.450> with<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.809> you'll<00:00:16.080> make

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
mountains and with this one you'll make

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.220 
mountains and with this one you'll make
about<00:00:16.470> 5<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.070> 10<00:00:17.100> k<00:00:17.460> an<00:00:17.640> hour<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.810> depends<00:00:19.170> on

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
about 5 to 10 k an hour it depends on

about 5 to 10 k an hour it depends on
your<00:00:19.380> luck<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> big<00:00:20.670> luck<00:00:20.939> one

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
always running around so you don't have

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.290 
always running around so you don't have
any<00:00:25.500> free<00:00:25.949> downtime<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.180> this

formula but what you're trying to get is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.870 
formula but what you're trying to get is
the<00:00:30.000> hyacinth<00:00:30.869> maca<00:00:31.289> which<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.369> most<00:00:32.610> servers

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the hyacinth maca which on most servers

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
the hyacinth maca which on most servers
is<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> run<00:00:33.600> about<00:00:33.870> 10k<00:00:35.719> minimum<00:00:36.719> some

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
is going to run about 10k minimum some

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.010 
is going to run about 10k minimum some
servers<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.920> will<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.520> about<00:00:38.610> 15<00:00:39.180> my

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
servers that will get up to about 15 my

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.830 
servers that will get up to about 15 my
server<00:00:40.290> runs<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.800> 10<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.420> also<00:00:42.570> get

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
server runs about 10 you can also get

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560 
server runs about 10 you can also get
the<00:00:42.989> first<00:00:43.530> mate<00:00:43.770> hat<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.570> transmog

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the first mate hat which is a transmog

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
the first mate hat which is a transmog
hat<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.379> looks<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.739> pirate<00:00:46.950> hat

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
hat that just looks like a pirate hat

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.010 
hat that just looks like a pirate hat
essentially<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.120> goes<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.570> 1<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> 2

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
essentially and it goes for about 1 to 2

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.220 
essentially and it goes for about 1 to 2
K<00:00:49.350> roughly<00:00:50.030> but<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> drops<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.809> anything

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
K roughly but it drops off of anything

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.830 
K roughly but it drops off of anything
in<00:00:52.350> STV<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> best<00:00:54.270> spot<00:00:54.449> though

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
in STV this is the best spot though

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
in STV this is the best spot though
because<00:00:55.079> these<00:00:55.379> guys<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.949> around<00:00:57.079> respawn

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because these guys all around respawn

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.389 
because these guys all around respawn
instantly<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.910> die<00:01:00.530> pretty<00:01:01.530> quickly<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
instantly as they die pretty quickly you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.680 
instantly as they die pretty quickly you
have<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.609> clear<00:01:02.820> over<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.059> too<00:01:03.420> because

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
have to clear over here too because

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
have to clear over here too because
you'll<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.790> clear<00:01:05.790> up

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you'll have to go back and clear up

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.120 
you'll have to go back and clear up
these<00:01:06.090> guys<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.960> instant<00:01:07.740> respond

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
these guys but they are instant respond

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340 
these guys but they are instant respond
essentially<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
essentially so you're going to be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
essentially so you're going to be
getting<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> kills<00:01:11.100> per<00:01:11.340> hour<00:01:11.549> very

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
getting a lot of kills per hour very

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
getting a lot of kills per hour very
very<00:01:12.780> fast<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> hyacinth<00:01:16.590> macaw<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
very fast and the hyacinth macaw is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.679 
very fast and the hyacinth macaw is
about<00:01:17.390> one<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:19.580> two<00:01:20.580> or<00:01:20.790> three<00:01:21.000> thousand<00:01:21.479> trop

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
about one and two or three thousand trop

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.340 
about one and two or three thousand trop
chance<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.650> low<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:25.020> keeps<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
chance it's pretty low but it keeps you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
chance it's pretty low but it keeps you
entertained<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.950> gets<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> doing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
entertained and gets you out of doing

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
entertained and gets you out of doing
all<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.450> other<00:01:27.689> farm<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.080> places<00:01:28.439> too<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.829> like

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
all the other farm in places too I like

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.039 
all the other farm in places too I like
switching<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.880> hate<00:01:30.060> farming<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> seems<00:01:30.810> far

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
switching up I hate farming it seems far

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690 
switching up I hate farming it seems far
all<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> time<00:01:31.500> no<00:01:31.710> matter<00:01:31.740> how<00:01:32.009> profitable<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
all the time no matter how profitable it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
all the time no matter how profitable it
is<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.180> gets<00:01:33.360> boring<00:01:33.630> doing<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> same

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
is it just gets boring doing the same

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.980 
is it just gets boring doing the same
thing<00:01:34.650> again<00:01:34.920> again<00:01:35.810> feels<00:01:36.810> redundant<00:01:38.990> but

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
thing again again feels redundant but

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.990 
thing again again feels redundant but
yeah<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.159> will<00:01:41.310> give<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.759> bit

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
yeah this one will give you a little bit

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
yeah this one will give you a little bit
of<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.180> variety<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> farm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
of a variety if you want to farm

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.880 
of a variety if you want to farm
something<00:01:44.399> else<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:45.390> always<00:01:46.290> druids<00:01:46.799> are

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
something else as always druids are

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.230 
something else as always druids are
really<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.579> stuff<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.030> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
really good for this stuff because of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
really good for this stuff because of
course<00:01:48.390> flight<00:01:48.720> form<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.229> instant<00:01:49.740> mouths<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
course flight form is instant mouths so

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.499 
course flight form is instant mouths so
you<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:50.880> any<00:01:50.939> trouble<00:01:51.479> getting

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
you don't have any trouble getting

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.130 
you don't have any trouble getting
around<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.640> star<00:01:53.640> fall<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.360> awesome<00:01:54.840> but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
around and star fall is just awesome but

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.770 
around and star fall is just awesome but
any<00:01:55.350> range<00:01:55.649> class<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.579> good

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
any range class would do really good

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.600 
any range class would do really good
melee<00:01:57.780> could<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> too<00:01:58.409> frankly<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.189> not

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
melee could do it too frankly it's not
