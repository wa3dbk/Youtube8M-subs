we can do is in Windows 7 I put a start

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
we can do is in Windows 7 I put a start
menu<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> type<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.219> system<00:01:02.850> repair<00:01:03.420> disk<00:01:03.660> or

create<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.229> system<00:01:04.589> repair<00:01:04.710> disk<00:01:05.570> let's<00:01:06.570> do

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
create a system repair disk let's do

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.890 
create a system repair disk let's do
this<00:01:06.930> you'll<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> CD<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:07.979> DVD<00:01:08.010> burner<00:01:08.900> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that's I suppose that's fine for a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.300 
that's I suppose that's fine for a
desktop<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> laptops<00:01:12.330> netbooks<00:01:13.110> though<00:01:13.680> well

you can't do this way I'll show you a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
you can't do this way I'll show you a
method<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.520> work<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:17.909> netbooks<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
method that will work for netbooks in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.359 
method that will work for netbooks in
the<00:01:18.570> future<00:01:18.869> video

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
the future video

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.940 
the future video
ok<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.850> now<00:01:20.970> we'll<00:01:21.360> go<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.259> either<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
ok so for now we'll go with either a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950 
ok so for now we'll go with either a
system<00:01:23.369> repair<00:01:23.490> disc<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.060> original

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
system repair disc or the original

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.980 
system repair disc or the original
windows<00:01:25.409> 7<00:01:25.650> install<00:01:25.979> disc<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:27.659> shut<00:01:27.869> the

windows 7 install disc to shut the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
windows 7 install disc to shut the
computer<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> boot<00:01:29.759> into<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
computer down and we need to boot into a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.090 
computer down and we need to boot into a
disk<00:01:32.329> here's<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> loaded<00:01:33.900> earlier<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> we

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
disk here's one I loaded earlier so we

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
disk here's one I loaded earlier so we
just<00:01:35.280> start<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:38.360> yes<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.509> want<00:01:39.659> boot<00:01:39.900> from<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
just start up yes we want boot from the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.980 
just start up yes we want boot from the
CD<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.220> DVD

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.870 

right<00:01:44.990> let's<00:01:45.260> choose<00:01:45.410> language<00:01:45.680> I<00:01:48.670> will<00:01:49.670> go

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
right let's choose language I will go

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.210 
right let's choose language I will go
for<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.420> option<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.960> repair<00:01:51.710> your<00:01:51.890> computer

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.140 

so<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.340> searching<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:55.850> windows

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
so it's searching for windows

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.480 
so it's searching for windows
installations<00:01:56.870> so<00:01:57.860> it's<00:01:57.980> a<00:01:58.010> lot<00:01:58.160> what<00:01:58.280> about

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
installations so it's a lot what about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.890 
installations so it's a lot what about
next<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.210> need<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.480> choose<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.040> OS<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.250> repair

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
next we need to choose the OS to repair

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.950 
next we need to choose the OS to repair
will<00:02:02.900> select<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.290> OS<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.770> repair<00:02:04.840> all<00:02:05.840> right

the<00:04:01.319> volume<00:04:01.590> with<00:04:01.769> wizard<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.790> next<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:04.069> think

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
the volume with wizard so next I think

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.039 
the volume with wizard so next I think
we<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.519> go<00:04:05.640> for<00:04:05.909> next<00:04:06.540> because<00:04:06.810> we're<00:04:06.959> going

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
we just go for next because we're going

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.690 
we just go for next because we're going
to<00:04:07.109> resize<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.829> make<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.129> take<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.489> all

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
to resize it and make it take up all

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.349 
to resize it and make it take up all
available<00:04:08.970> space<00:04:10.040> that's<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.250> finished<00:04:12.030> I

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.520 

think<00:04:15.359> actually<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.720> can<00:04:15.810> just<00:04:15.959> close<00:04:16.139> and

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
think actually you can just close and

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.740 
think actually you can just close and
it's<00:04:16.979> automatically<00:04:17.519> done<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.449> it's<00:04:18.600> going

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
it's automatically done it so it's going

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.230 
it's automatically done it so it's going
to<00:04:18.840> Windows<00:04:19.320> Explorer<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:20.160> double<00:04:20.579> check<00:04:20.789> so

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.390 

properties<00:04:24.380> has<00:04:25.380> indeed<00:04:25.710> increased<00:04:26.160> the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
properties has indeed increased the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.690 
properties has indeed increased the
maximum<00:04:26.610> capacity<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.650> our<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.550> how

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
maximum capacity so our that that is how

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.850 
maximum capacity so our that that is how
