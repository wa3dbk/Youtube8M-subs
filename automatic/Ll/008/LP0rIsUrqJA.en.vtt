 locations where these can appear 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.290
 meats I suppose there are ten in each 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.710
 site but I have not found all of them 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.239

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.530
 no no no 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 to rhythm but I need a place where 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.630
 cook for the souls 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.590

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.700

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.630
 Y 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.290
 is that the garden 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.070
 Well, as you could see only in the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.959
 burger town is where there are ten 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.139
 locations of the meat and in the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.949
 other places I just found this we 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.540
 they missed like three of ten or two d10s I 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.280
 I think that's where you need those to 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.780
 complete it and I'm sure if it's missing 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.540
 place exists so say in the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.699
 comments and to help others and 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.510
