00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.890 

let's<00:00:05.779> next<00:00:06.049> look<00:00:06.319> at<00:00:06.559> soil<00:00:06.950> water<00:00:07.189> retention

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
let's next look at soil water retention

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.100 
let's next look at soil water retention
now<00:00:08.900> what<00:00:09.049> does<00:00:09.170> that<00:00:09.200> term<00:00:09.530> retention<00:00:09.740> mean

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
now what does that term retention mean

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.480 
now what does that term retention mean
retention<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.200> referring<00:00:12.710> to<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.009> ability<00:00:13.099> of

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
retention is referring to the ability of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.970 
retention is referring to the ability of
the<00:00:13.669> soil<00:00:13.940> to<00:00:14.059> hold<00:00:14.509> or<00:00:14.719> retain<00:00:15.019> water<00:00:15.259> against

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
the soil to hold or retain water against

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.240 
the soil to hold or retain water against
the<00:00:16.099> pull<00:00:16.279> of<00:00:16.430> gravity

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
the pull of gravity

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.009 
the pull of gravity
obviously<00:00:19.250> soils<00:00:19.700> will<00:00:19.880> vary<00:00:20.180> in<00:00:20.450> terms<00:00:20.840> of

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
obviously soils will vary in terms of

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.960 
obviously soils will vary in terms of
how<00:00:21.170> much<00:00:21.380> water<00:00:21.710> they<00:00:21.980> can<00:00:22.250> hold<00:00:22.490> against

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
how much water they can hold against

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.410 
how much water they can hold against
this<00:00:23.060> gravitational<00:00:23.570> pull<00:00:25.090> there<00:00:26.090> are<00:00:26.240> two

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
this gravitational pull there are two

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.179 
this gravitational pull there are two
conditions<00:00:26.660> that<00:00:27.109> we<00:00:27.199> need<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.500> discuss<00:00:27.920> when

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
conditions that we need to discuss when

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.390 
conditions that we need to discuss when
it<00:00:28.310> s<00:00:28.699> related<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.269> soil<00:00:29.480> water<00:00:29.750> retention<00:00:30.400> the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
it s related to soil water retention the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.009 
it s related to soil water retention the
first<00:00:31.670> of<00:00:31.849> those<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.330> what<00:00:32.629> I<00:00:32.660> will<00:00:32.870> call

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
first of those is what I will call

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.660 
first of those is what I will call
saturated<00:00:35.170> soils<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.589> are<00:00:36.650> saturated<00:00:37.519> our

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
saturated soils that are saturated our

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.649 
saturated soils that are saturated our
retaining<00:00:38.180> water

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.310 
retaining water
above<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.769> normal<00:00:40.070> gravitational<00:00:40.850> pull<00:00:41.320> in

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
above the normal gravitational pull in

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.710 
above the normal gravitational pull in
order<00:00:42.530> for<00:00:42.680> this<00:00:42.769> to<00:00:42.830> happen<00:00:43.269> what<00:00:44.269> that<00:00:44.449> means

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
order for this to happen what that means

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.689 
order for this to happen what that means
is<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.170> there<00:00:45.530> has<00:00:45.710> to<00:00:45.739> be<00:00:45.949> something<00:00:46.549> in

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
is that there has to be something in

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.119 
is that there has to be something in
that<00:00:47.000> soil<00:00:47.150> profile<00:00:47.720> that<00:00:48.019> is<00:00:48.170> causing<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
that soil profile that is causing the

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.700 
that soil profile that is causing the
free<00:00:49.400> water<00:00:49.670> also<00:00:50.390> sometimes<00:00:51.080> refer<00:00:51.409> to<00:00:51.440> as

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
free water also sometimes refer to as

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.280 
free water also sometimes refer to as
excess<00:00:52.129> or<00:00:52.280> gravitational<00:00:52.729> water<00:00:53.210> not<00:00:53.989> to

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
excess or gravitational water not to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.929

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:55.939 
flow out of the center of these soil

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.000 
flow out of the center of these soil

pore spaces and on downward in the soil
profile<00:00:59.890> oftentimes<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.129> can<00:01:01.339> lead<00:01:01.549> to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
profile oftentimes this can lead to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.609 
profile oftentimes this can lead to
conditions<00:01:02.330> which<00:01:02.809> are<00:01:02.960> referred<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:03.350> as

conditions which are referred to as
water<00:01:03.860> logging<00:01:04.430> which<00:01:05.119> obviously<00:01:05.689> cause<00:01:06.170> poor

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
water logging which obviously cause poor

under most field conditions this does

not occur and therefore is not as

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
unsaturated soil water retention we were

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.160 
unsaturated soil water retention we were
going<00:01:34.819> to<00:01:34.880> spend<00:01:35.090> most<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.359> our<00:01:35.479> time<00:01:35.539> on<00:01:35.840> such

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
will say about saturated water flow is

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.980 
will say about saturated water flow is
that<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:43.009> does<00:01:43.249> obviously<00:01:43.490> occur<00:01:44.179> below<00:01:44.749> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
that it does obviously occur below the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.510 
that it does obviously occur below the
