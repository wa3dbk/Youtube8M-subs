look<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> villagers<00:01:14.010> running<00:01:14.369> into<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
look at the villagers running into the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
look at the villagers running into the
town<00:01:15.570> hall<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.439> taking<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> feel

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
town hall as I'm taking it out I feel

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
town hall as I'm taking it out I feel
like<00:01:17.939> super<00:01:18.360> soldiers<00:01:18.810> planned<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
like super soldiers planned for that but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.130 
like super soldiers planned for that but
then<00:01:20.640> again<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
then again when you think about how the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.780 
then again when you think about how the
villagers<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.070> around<00:01:23.189> clapping

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
villagers just go around clapping

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
villagers just go around clapping
everywhere<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> guess<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> makes

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
everywhere I guess it kind of makes

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.350 
everywhere I guess it kind of makes
sense<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.729> stupid<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
sense that they would be so stupid as to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.300 
sense that they would be so stupid as to
run<00:01:28.229> into<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> building<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.159> being

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
run into a building as it's being

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.700 
run into a building as it's being
destroyed<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.520> that's<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.619> kind<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
destroyed as well so that's just kind of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.249 
destroyed as well so that's just kind of
funny<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.420> little<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.170> uh<00:01:38.060> 2%

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259
