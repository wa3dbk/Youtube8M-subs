00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.490
 how do I upload replays come up very often 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.099
 the question people that you how can I 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.210
 send the replays and so on and on 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.980
 because you do not always write that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 I just want to do that now 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.039
 video eisemann looks a bit 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.500
 Surreptitious advertising must also be allowed 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.970
 google germany so there you enter 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.380

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.070

 See here from the wot replays there 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.090
 you already stop various replays 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.010
 the people have uploaded so that works 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.059
 just up here you have login 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.660
 German so it is an easy way around 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.370

 Korea are located and not in America 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.619

 conditions so there is now login 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 I am now when she logged when 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.970
 because that's just a cookie 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.229
 otherwise we were saved 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.220
 just a window where your your data 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.680
 have to enter with no idea 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.090
 absolute boxer thong and then password 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.040
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
 Whatever your say 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.299

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.659
 page here and then comes upload wii 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.329
 But we can do that at all 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.130
 first look who does not know where your 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.829
 siplace are so I'm pulling now 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.399
 other window purely prepared here 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.890
 I 've prepared something so that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.450
 Everybody I say where in his 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.860
 directory on his computer is li 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.509
 well with me is on a ssd plate 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 heal games world of tanks and these 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.930
 folder he goes in then you see here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.640
 already different small other folders 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 also has with the mods and rasmus and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.569
 here also our friend David 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.640
 and then replays then you go up 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.170
 replay double-click on it and 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.430
 There are thousands of people here 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.080
 replays so we see I would like too 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.190
 clean up again and look for you 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.349
 Sometime from here so you have yes 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.670
 this is where your replays are good 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.099
 then we go to upload replay 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.319
 Then Josty Feil said 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.810
 So you can just replays it in there 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.440
 game club where they are in then give them 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.000
 title 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.430
 So no idea whatsoever me 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.950
 just great or something like that 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:52.180
 I was mega mega description great as 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.549
 example so and then push case goes 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.870
 her on it and go into this folder the 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.129
 I just showed you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.329
 you go in and then choose from it 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.269
 that, for example, there are already eleven games 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.680
 world of tanks replays there is that 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.760
 the example as you go pulls on it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.810
 here but then first look where 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.810
 they have remained folder here 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.020
 the place so you can now 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.170
 so to pull 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.570
 as an example and then you say 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.980
 upload replay says the victory so me 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.240
 Not just anybody knows now 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.220
 I just think that's great 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.170
 Personals gate and then you see 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.490
 these pages you or at least 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.560
 Finally, I'll tell the pages of the 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.060
 individual battles as well as ever 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.550
 if i kept the pace high the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.380
 left not set and you send 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.850
 me now just with a small 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.190
 description what you really great 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.240
 So it was from a replay where you the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.970
 you are human that was great that 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.780
 was exciting or whatever 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.300
 above this www.hotels.com time platinum 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.770
 or stop then person of the court then 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.810
 is the safe because that is on its own 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.310
 then that's the replay of me 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.500
 get that means I get the exact 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.120
 the link to the replay what you see here 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.520
 Of course, that's not great that was 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.860
 Yesterday somebody was fighting or 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.480
 someday and said that sends 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.190
 me a little description around 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.060
 that we are also great about either 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:25.330
 facebook to oc or then to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.770
 sonos like youtube and then we'll see 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.580
 I would be me if I can do it 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.350
 Watch as they are said 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.880
 unlikely unlikely many 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.060
 suddenly get it now and that's why 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.410
 Do not be angry if you are not if you are 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.430
 It does not matter because it really is 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.780
 contain too much 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.140
 and to do that, too again 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.190
 by the way and happy if selected 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.800
 and if not do not be angry 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.240
 simply try again yes i hope 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.500
 the replay I could help if still 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.930
 any questions are ambiguities 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.630
 the ccc 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.010
 let me know then I can do that 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.570
 rework or as well 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.040
 But always I think otherwise would be 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.800
 I believe that most clearly as one does 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.690
 that 'll be good then I hope 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.050
 great replays of you and to the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.050
 next time
