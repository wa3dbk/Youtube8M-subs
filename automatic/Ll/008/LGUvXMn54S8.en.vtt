fourth<00:04:49.360> behind<00:04:49.509> fazer

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
fourth behind fazer

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.839 
fourth behind fazer
and<00:04:50.379> I<00:04:50.499> think<00:04:50.679> that's<00:04:50.830> probably<00:04:51.069> it<00:04:51.339> as<00:04:51.520> far<00:04:51.699> as

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
and I think that's probably it as far as

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.600 
and I think that's probably it as far as
chance<00:04:52.089> is<00:04:52.240> concerned<00:04:53.189> coming<00:04:54.189> down<00:04:54.309> the<00:04:54.429> last

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
chance is concerned coming down the last

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.519 
chance is concerned coming down the last
minute<00:04:54.939> or<00:04:55.089> so<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.569> it's<00:04:55.719> Markus<00:04:56.199> leading

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
minute or so and it's Markus leading

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.469 
minute or so and it's Markus leading
Oliver<00:04:56.830> all<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:57.009> us<00:04:57.099> being<00:04:57.249> quite<00:04:57.490> rough<00:04:57.789> and<00:04:58.089> I

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
Oliver all of us being quite rough and I

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.299 
Oliver all of us being quite rough and I
think<00:04:58.659> Marcus<00:04:59.259> probably<00:04:59.619> knows<00:04:59.800> actually<00:05:00.009> if

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:00.309 
think Marcus probably knows actually if

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:01.799 
think Marcus probably knows actually if
he<00:05:00.399> lets<00:05:00.610> him<00:05:00.789> through<00:05:01.059> it<00:05:01.179> Oliver<00:05:01.599> wins

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:01.809 
he lets him through it Oliver wins

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:03.779 
he lets him through it Oliver wins
Marcos<00:05:02.289> doing<00:05:02.469> it's<00:05:02.589> a<00:05:02.649> second<00:05:02.949> overall<00:05:03.219> and

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
Marcos doing it's a second overall and

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.339 
Marcos doing it's a second overall and
he<00:05:03.849> has<00:05:04.029> that<00:05:04.179> in<00:05:04.330> through<00:05:04.509> that<00:05:04.539> some<00:05:05.139> good

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
he has that in through that some good

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.049 
he has that in through that some good
intelligence<00:05:05.860> thinking<00:05:06.099> of<00:05:06.219> Marcus<00:05:06.550> Oliver

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:07.059 
intelligence thinking of Marcus Oliver

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:08.609 
intelligence thinking of Marcus Oliver
who's<00:05:07.179> been<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> bit<00:05:07.599> to<00:05:07.749> carry<00:05:08.259> so<00:05:08.439> he's<00:05:08.529> able

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:08.619 
who's been a bit to carry so he's able

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:10.350 
who's been a bit to carry so he's able
taking<00:05:08.919> maneuvers<00:05:09.249> and<00:05:09.399> pick<00:05:09.490> up<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.759> win<00:05:09.909> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
taking maneuvers and pick up the win the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.519 
taking maneuvers and pick up the win the
winner<00:05:10.569> I<00:05:10.659> think<00:05:10.929> we'll<00:05:11.020> give<00:05:11.139> him<00:05:11.229> third

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 
winner I think we'll give him third

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.499 
winner I think we'll give him third
overall<00:05:12.009> but<00:05:12.399> the<00:05:12.490> second<00:05:12.879> place<00:05:12.939> of<00:05:13.149> Marcus

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:13.509 
overall but the second place of Marcus

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.089 
overall but the second place of Marcus
will<00:05:14.020> give<00:05:14.199> him<00:05:14.349> the<00:05:14.529> second<00:05:14.830> place<00:05:14.979> that

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
will give him the second place that

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.679 
will give him the second place that
