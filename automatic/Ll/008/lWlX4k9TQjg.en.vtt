00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.200
 in his crisis in his face and those things and 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.969
 Well, let's do the challenge of this one 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.010
 of guessing characters I'm going to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.510
 represent a character with mime and he 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.130
 you have to guess then we are going to 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 do the same for my channel and I'm going to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 have to guess what he says so 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.350
 if you want to know who is going to win you have 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.939
 that see our videos we are going to make a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.939
 total of 5 characters so 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.630
 we started 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.620
 First 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.620
 this is very easy 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.730
 bald 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.960
 we come back 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.430
 I told you it was easy this I do not know how 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.430
 can do it 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.110
 so I'm going to do it first should 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.360
 really talk 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.809
 nothing is worth it, that counts at last 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.809
 a speck 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 as a brand 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.310
 in clear harry potter rest 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.039
 I do not forget 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.039
 and that 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.350
 an idea 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.830
 the son of the book seriously 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.490
 yes it's worth edward 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.490
 the light 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
 d 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.640
 this is a character but it is that we do not 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640
 will represent so I will pass 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.190
 those things of a magic plan are worth 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.790
 in you they protect you 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.230
 and you die before you die 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 I give up with this worth the meat is worth 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.060

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.450

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.969
 a missing or delayed forgiveness 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.969
 well, nothing 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.539
 that's not good to know who has 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:55.659
 won then you have to press on his face 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:06:00.190

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.190
