00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
good flight stability program that it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.140 
good flight stability program that it
takes<00:02:20.230> from<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.650> ar.drone<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.730> big<00:02:21.910> brother

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
takes from the ar.drone the big brother

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.809 
takes from the ar.drone the big brother
and<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.110> guy's<00:02:23.319> only<00:02:23.530> 55<00:02:24.130> grams<00:02:24.430> so

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
and this guy's only 55 grams so

this<00:02:31.719> right<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.349> will<00:02:32.709> attach<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
this right here this will attach to the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.809 
this right here this will attach to the
top<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.750> with<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.500> which<00:02:36.010> what<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.400> means<00:02:36.579> is

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
top and with this which what it means is

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.940 
top and with this which what it means is
that<00:02:36.969> you<00:02:37.120> can<00:02:37.359> then<00:02:37.620> connect<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.739> wheels

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that you can then connect the wheels

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.580 
that you can then connect the wheels
connect<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.609> up<00:02:39.810> connect<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> wheels<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.439> it

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
connect this up connect the wheels to it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.630 
connect this up connect the wheels to it
and<00:02:43.170> fly<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.200> with<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.560> wheels<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.340> that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
and fly it with the wheels on and that

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.920 
and fly it with the wheels on and that
means<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:45.939> can<00:02:46.090> roll<00:02:46.269> across<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.599> ground

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
means you can roll across the ground

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.259 
means you can roll across the ground
roll<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.379> walls<00:02:47.680> or<00:02:48.099> roll<00:02:48.400> across<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> roof<00:02:49.060> if

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.129 
you really want to so lots of fun things
that<00:02:51.189> you<00:02:51.250> can<00:02:51.400> do<00:02:51.549> with<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.689> with<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> wheels

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
that you can do with it with the wheels

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.929 
that you can do with it with the wheels
on<00:02:53.409> or<00:02:53.739> you<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:54.069> just<00:02:54.310> take<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.579> wheels<00:02:54.760> off

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
on or you can just take the wheels off

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.410 
on or you can just take the wheels off
and<00:02:55.180> fly<00:02:55.359> it<00:02:55.420> like<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.659> normal<00:02:55.930> little<00:02:56.290> drum<00:02:57.420> so

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and fly it like a normal little drum so

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.030 
and fly it like a normal little drum so
the<00:02:58.540> drone<00:02:58.689> itself<00:02:59.139> is<00:02:59.319> pretty<00:02:59.530> easy<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.920> use

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
the drone itself is pretty easy to use

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.949 
the drone itself is pretty easy to use
it<00:03:00.430> hovers<00:03:00.670> very<00:03:00.909> easily<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.450> takes<00:03:01.659> off<00:03:01.840> and

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
it hovers very easily it takes off and

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.170 
it hovers very easily it takes off and
lands<00:03:02.379> with<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.889> push<00:03:03.129> of<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.340> button<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
lands with a push of a button the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.449 
lands with a push of a button the
efforts<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.780> free<00:03:05.079> flight<00:03:05.379> 3<00:03:05.709> by<00:03:05.889> parrot<00:03:06.280> is

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
efforts of free flight 3 by parrot is

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.129 
efforts of free flight 3 by parrot is
it's<00:03:07.060> pretty<00:03:07.329> good<00:03:07.510> it's<00:03:07.720> pretty<00:03:07.870> simplistic

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
it's pretty good it's pretty simplistic

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.750 
it's pretty good it's pretty simplistic
there's<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.859> few<00:03:09.099> settings<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.549> can<00:03:09.669> go

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
there's a few settings you can go

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.879 
there's a few settings you can go
through<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.030> sit<00:03:10.329> different<00:03:10.659> things<00:03:10.900> up<00:03:11.109> like

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
through to sit different things up like

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.229 
through to sit different things up like
it<00:03:12.069> when<00:03:12.159> you<00:03:12.250> put<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.519> wheels<00:03:12.700> on<00:03:12.939> you<00:03:13.120> have

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
it when you put the wheels on you have

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.759 
it when you put the wheels on you have
to<00:03:13.329> change<00:03:13.689> it<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:13.989> sitting<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.590> knows

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
to change it in the sitting so it knows

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.520 
to change it in the sitting so it knows
it<00:03:14.980> has<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.280> wheels<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:16.989> saying<00:03:17.260> that

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
it has the wheels on and in saying that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.860 
it has the wheels on and in saying that
you<00:03:17.980> know<00:03:18.489> going<00:03:18.669> up<00:03:18.879> walls<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.450> things<00:03:19.689> like

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
you know going up walls and things like

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.599 
you know going up walls and things like
that<00:03:20.049> is<00:03:20.230> very<00:03:20.260> difficult<00:03:21.189> with<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.400> wheels

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
that is very difficult with the wheels

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.339 
that is very difficult with the wheels
they<00:03:21.879> make<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.239> look<00:03:22.359> easy<00:03:22.540> but<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.049> really

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
they make it look easy but it's really

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.740 
they make it look easy but it's really
not<00:03:23.680> release<00:03:24.040> for<00:03:24.310> me<00:03:24.340> anyway<00:03:24.849> so<00:03:24.909> I'm<00:03:25.120> making

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
not release for me anyway so I'm making

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.149 
not release for me anyway so I'm making
it<00:03:25.959> roll<00:03:26.079> across<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.379> ground<00:03:26.709> that's<00:03:26.950> pretty

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
it roll across the ground that's pretty

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.250 
it roll across the ground that's pretty
easy<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:27.639> making<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.000> roll<00:03:28.209> across<00:03:28.450> up<00:03:28.900> walls

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
easy but making it roll across up walls

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.520 
easy but making it roll across up walls
or<00:03:29.590> across<00:03:29.859> a<00:03:29.889> roof<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.489> very<00:03:30.579> very<00:03:31.180> difficult

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
or across a roof is very very difficult

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.990 
or across a roof is very very difficult
aside<00:03:32.530> from<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.159> very<00:03:33.370> fun<00:03:33.699> to<00:03:33.849> use

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
aside from that it's very fun to use

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.420 
aside from that it's very fun to use
very<00:03:34.329> easy<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.840> preset<00:03:35.260> tricks<00:03:35.769> are<00:03:36.010> really
