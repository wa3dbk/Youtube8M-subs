transcript for we not release it I don't

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.080 
transcript for we not release it I don't
know<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:17.200> anyway<00:01:17.469> the<00:01:18.069> small<00:01:18.579> scrap<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:18.909> paper

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
know but anyway the small scrap of paper

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.010 
know but anyway the small scrap of paper
in<00:01:19.359> fact<00:01:19.539> I<00:01:19.689> see<00:01:19.840> moon<00:01:20.079> in<00:01:20.319> Illuminati<00:01:20.740> code

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
in fact I see moon in Illuminati code

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.249 
in fact I see moon in Illuminati code
this<00:01:23.020> obviously<00:01:23.950> could<00:01:24.310> relate<00:01:24.639> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:26.049> moon

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
this obviously could relate to the moon

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.160 
this obviously could relate to the moon
somehow<00:01:26.979> we<00:01:27.490> don't<00:01:27.729> know<00:01:28.590> maybe<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:30.840> lap<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
somehow we don't know maybe a lap on the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.529 
somehow we don't know maybe a lap on the
moon<00:01:32.319> or<00:01:32.679> something<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.819> do<00:01:33.969> with<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.209> storyline

was disappointed she's just got like
half<00:02:28.629> legs<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.349> kind<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.829> like<00:02:30.010> floating

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
half legs just kind of like floating

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.690 
half legs just kind of like floating
there<00:02:31.049> like<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:34.079> no<00:02:35.079> yes<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.249> this<00:02:36.430> moat

there like that no yes so this moat

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.809 
there like that no yes so this moat
could<00:02:36.939> also<00:02:37.139> perhaps<00:02:38.280> symbolize<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.519> next

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
could also perhaps symbolize the next

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.000 
could also perhaps symbolize the next
map<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.209> well<00:02:40.420> which<00:02:40.599> may<00:02:41.200> or<00:02:41.230> may<00:02:41.530> not<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.799> on

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
map as well which may or may not be on

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.830 
map as well which may or may not be on
the<00:02:42.129> moon<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.670> now<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.120> lot<00:02:43.329> of<00:02:43.359> people<00:02:43.450> think

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the moon and now a lot of people think

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.129 
the moon and now a lot of people think
it's<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.109> bad<00:02:44.290> idea<00:02:44.549> but<00:02:45.549> I<00:02:45.879> don't<00:02:46.450> know<00:02:46.599> what<00:02:47.079> do

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
it's a bad idea but I don't know what do

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.899 
it's a bad idea but I don't know what do
you<00:02:47.230> think<00:02:47.409> about<00:02:47.439> how<00:02:48.040> about<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.370> there<00:02:48.730> has

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
you think about how about you there has

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.849 
you think about how about you there has
been<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> lot<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.510> talk<00:02:49.959> about<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.439> being<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.769> the

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
been a lot of talk about it being on the

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.589 
been a lot of talk about it being on the
moon<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.700> various<00:02:52.269> sources<00:02:53.609> but<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:55.419> maybe

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
moon from various sources but the maybe

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.300 
moon from various sources but the maybe
the<00:02:55.750> whole<00:02:55.959> ascension<00:02:56.469> finger<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:56.889> a<00:02:56.980> space

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
the whole ascension finger with a space

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.190 
the whole ascension finger with a space
station<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.879> Cosmodrome<00:02:58.450> quite<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.959> same

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
station the Cosmodrome quite the same

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.250 
station the Cosmodrome quite the same
thing<00:03:00.060> yeah<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> Cosmodrome<00:03:01.689> you<00:03:01.900> got<00:03:02.169> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
thing yeah the Cosmodrome you got the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.929 
thing yeah the Cosmodrome you got the
rocket<00:03:02.620> which<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.829> blasting<00:03:03.250> off<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.879> know

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
rocket which is blasting off you know

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.420 
rocket which is blasting off you know
blatantly<00:03:04.510> outer<00:03:05.409> space<00:03:05.769> somewhere<00:03:06.099> but<00:03:06.310> you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
blatantly outer space somewhere but you

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.240 
blatantly outer space somewhere but you
know<00:03:06.549> it<00:03:06.669> could<00:03:06.790> be<00:03:06.939> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.299> moon<00:03:08.250> maybe

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
know it could be going to the moon maybe

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.000 
know it could be going to the moon maybe
the<00:03:10.180> characters<00:03:10.689> were<00:03:10.719> like<00:03:11.650> supposed<00:03:11.949> to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the characters were like supposed to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.129 
the characters were like supposed to
ride<00:03:12.250> that<00:03:12.280> right<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.239> rocket<00:03:13.359> all<00:03:13.689> you<00:03:13.959> never

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
ride that right the rocket all you never

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.659 
ride that right the rocket all you never
know<00:03:14.199> it<00:03:14.530> could<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.829> new<00:03:14.949> character<00:03:15.310> white<00:03:15.519> it

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
know it could be new character white it

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.300 
know it could be new character white it
is<00:03:15.760> new<00:03:15.939> characters<00:03:16.389> yes<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.290> next<00:03:17.500> map<00:03:17.650> which

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
is new characters yes the next map which

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.800 
is new characters yes the next map which
has<00:03:18.459> been<00:03:18.579> confirmed<00:03:18.790> by<00:03:18.939> try<00:03:19.209> och<00:03:19.359> there<00:03:19.719> is

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
has been confirmed by try och there is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.159 
has been confirmed by try och there is
new<00:03:20.019> characters<00:03:20.500> apparently<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.459> yeah<00:03:22.169> so

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
new characters apparently so yeah so

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.619 
new characters apparently so yeah so
could<00:03:23.859> be<00:03:24.040> on<00:03:24.669> a<00:03:24.730> space<00:03:25.000> station<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.449> moon

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
could be on a space station in the moon

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.939 
could be on a space station in the moon
ma'am<00:03:26.319> in<00:03:26.739> fact<00:03:27.549> Luna<00:03:28.479> was<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.500> name<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.709> a

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
ma'am in fact Luna was the name of a

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.839 
ma'am in fact Luna was the name of a
space<00:03:30.220> station<00:03:30.489> on<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.849> moon<00:03:31.209> there<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.169> go

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
space station on the moon there you go

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.719 
space station on the moon there you go
and<00:03:33.849> they'll<00:03:34.239> sort<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.659> put<00:03:35.379> him<00:03:35.530> well<00:03:36.459> there's

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
and they'll sort of put him well there's

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.309 
and they'll sort of put him well there's
a<00:03:36.790> lot<00:03:36.909> of<00:03:36.970> evidence<00:03:37.180> from<00:03:37.540> firing<00:03:37.900> range

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
a lot of evidence from firing range

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.649 
a lot of evidence from firing range
could<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.400> perhaps<00:03:39.639> Fink<00:03:40.030> trail<00:03:40.299> could

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
could you perhaps Fink trail could

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.339 
could you perhaps Fink trail could
convert<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.620> into<00:03:41.859> a<00:03:42.540> third<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.079> firing

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
convert that into a third of the firing

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.789 
convert that into a third of the firing
range<00:03:44.709> theory<00:03:45.129> yeah<00:03:46.349> that's<00:03:47.349> up<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.650> you<00:03:47.769> guys

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
range theory yeah that's up to you guys

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.780 
range theory yeah that's up to you guys
to<00:03:47.949> decide<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.780> yeah<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:51.189> my<00:03:51.430> very<00:03:51.669> own

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
to decide so yeah it in my very own

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.759 
to decide so yeah it in my very own
opinion<00:03:52.359> I<00:03:52.479> wouldn't<00:03:52.870> mind<00:03:53.109> on<00:03:53.439> the<00:03:53.590> moon

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
opinion I wouldn't mind on the moon

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.699 
opinion I wouldn't mind on the moon
because<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.699> even<00:03:55.629> on<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.840> terminal<00:03:56.139> it<00:03:56.500> did

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
because and even on the terminal it did

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.039 
because and even on the terminal it did
say<00:03:57.009> and<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.729> different<00:03:58.090> locations<00:03:58.810> where

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
say and the different locations where

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.159 
say and the different locations where
115<00:03:59.650> has<00:03:59.919> been<00:04:00.129> found<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.699> yes<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.750> can

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
115 has been found and yes you can

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.240 
115 has been found and yes you can
actually<00:04:02.349> see<00:04:02.709> on<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.400> darice<00:04:04.269> there<00:04:04.659> is<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:05.250> kind

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
actually see on a darice there is a kind

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.399 
actually see on a darice there is a kind
of<00:04:06.370> lucky<00:04:06.669> a<00:04:06.969> small<00:04:07.540> area<00:04:07.840> on<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.199> moon<00:04:08.379> that

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
of lucky a small area on the moon that

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.969 
of lucky a small area on the moon that
is<00:04:08.919> glowing<00:04:09.459> orange<00:04:09.909> use<00:04:10.859> obviously<00:04:11.859> the

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
is glowing orange use obviously the

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.770 
is glowing orange use obviously the
color<00:04:12.159> of<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.430> element<00:04:12.729> 115<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:16.570> would

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.360 
color of the element 115 but this would
probably<00:04:17.049> be<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.440> would<00:04:17.590> be<00:04:17.739> an<00:04:18.130> interesting

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
probably be it would be an interesting

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
yeah yes and yes the meteors are up on

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.439 
yeah yes and yes the meteors are up on
the<00:04:54.199> moon<00:04:54.379> so<00:04:54.680> any<00:04:54.949> previous<00:04:55.639> astronauts<00:04:56.240> or

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
the moon so any previous astronauts or

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.119 
the moon so any previous astronauts or
people<00:04:56.779> in<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.990> space<00:04:57.229> station<00:04:57.680> may<00:04:57.889> very

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
people in the space station may very

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.219 
people in the space station may very
well<00:04:58.339> be<00:04:58.550> zombified<00:04:59.300> by<00:04:59.659> there<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.020> we<00:05:00.139> can

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
well be zombified by there and we can

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.450 
well be zombified by there and we can
see<00:05:00.469> the<00:05:00.650> meteors<00:05:01.039> on<00:05:01.339> the<00:05:02.089> reason<00:05:02.539> dissension

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
see the meteors on the reason dissension

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.659 
see the meteors on the reason dissension
so<00:05:04.460> yeah<00:05:04.870> shape<00:05:05.870> mayor<00:05:06.259> teddy<00:05:07.249> bear<00:05:07.400> paws
