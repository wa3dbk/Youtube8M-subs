00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
there and then we're going to hand

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.330 
there and then we're going to hand
massage<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.310> later<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:36.500> also<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.830> spice

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
massage it later I also like to spice

this<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.420> add<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:39.990> other

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
better if you just massage the salad

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.910 
better if you just massage the salad
first<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.179> what<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:46.050> by<00:01:46.200> massage<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
first so what I mean by massage is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160 
first so what I mean by massage is
literally<00:01:47.310> take<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:47.850> hands<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.360> wash<00:01:48.990> them

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
literally take your hands and wash them

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.590 
literally take your hands and wash them
first<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.179> hands<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.539> there

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
first and then get your hands in there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.969 
first and then get your hands in there
and<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.410> work<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:54.330> salad<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.830> avocado

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and just work the salad and the avocado

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.899 
and just work the salad and the avocado
together<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> tendencies<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.700> might

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
together one of the tendencies you might

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
together one of the tendencies you might
want<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.750> doing<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.440> rush<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
want to do when doing this is rush and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
want to do when doing this is rush and
just<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.429> really<00:02:02.610> fast<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.509> because

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
just get really fast to do it because

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
just get really fast to do it because
you're<00:02:04.380> impatient<00:02:04.649> or<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> might<00:02:05.190> be<00:02:05.340> hungry

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you're impatient or you might be hungry

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.320 
you're impatient or you might be hungry
or<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.479> don't<00:02:06.659> feel<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.050> doing<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
or you don't feel like doing this and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.669 
or you don't feel like doing this and
one<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.509> key<00:02:09.690> things<00:02:09.720> about<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
one of the key things about this is

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.680 
one of the key things about this is
really<00:02:11.039> taking<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.489> time<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> whenever

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
really taking your time and whenever

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.080 
really taking your time and whenever
you're<00:02:12.989> working<00:02:13.170> with<00:02:13.530> food<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:14.910> want

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
you're working with food you really want

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.699 
you're working with food you really want
to<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.209> present<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:15.870> food<00:02:16.049> it's<00:02:16.200> very

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
to be present with your food it's very

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.930 
to be present with your food it's very
easy<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.870> eat<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.230> fast<00:02:19.350> not<00:02:20.220> chew<00:02:20.610> swallow

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
easy to eat really fast not chew swallow

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.110 
easy to eat really fast not chew swallow
bites<00:02:21.480> hole<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.579> a<00:02:23.850> harder

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
bites hole and then you have a harder

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.330 
bites hole and then you have a harder
time<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.360> elimination<00:02:24.930> later<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.160> when

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
time with elimination later on but when

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.009 
time with elimination later on but when
you<00:02:26.430> get<00:02:26.610> present<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.269> your<00:02:27.450> food<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
you get present with your food and

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.930 
you get present with your food and
actually<00:02:28.680> look<00:02:28.890> at<00:02:29.040> what<00:02:29.190> you're<00:02:29.400> doing<00:02:29.760> and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
actually look at what you're doing and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
be involved and take time and realize

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.039 
be involved and take time and realize
that<00:02:32.760> you're<00:02:32.910> creating<00:02:33.090> something<00:02:33.269> amazing

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
that you're creating something amazing

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.449 
that you're creating something amazing
for<00:02:34.079> your<00:02:34.320> body<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.709> you're<00:02:34.860> making<00:02:34.980> healthy

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
for your body and you're making healthy

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.729 
for your body and you're making healthy
choices<00:02:35.489> for<00:02:36.060> yourself<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:37.260> might<00:02:37.440> take<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> few

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
choices for yourself it might take a few

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.250 
choices for yourself it might take a few
moments<00:02:38.010> longer<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> find<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.959> comes

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
moments longer but I find that it comes

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410 
moments longer but I find that it comes
out<00:02:40.440> better<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:41.280> tastes<00:02:41.700> better<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.000> more

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
out better it tastes better and more

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.240 
out better it tastes better and more
than<00:02:42.600> anything<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:43.200> more<00:02:43.680> grateful<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
than anything I'm more grateful and I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.710 
than anything I'm more grateful and I
can<00:02:44.400> appreciate<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.850> food<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.299> I'm<00:02:45.390> making

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
can appreciate the food that I'm making

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.080 
can appreciate the food that I'm making
so<00:02:46.519> one<00:02:47.519> thing<00:02:47.640> you're<00:02:47.790> going<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.940> notice

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
so one thing you're going to notice

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.380 
so one thing you're going to notice
after<00:02:48.750> massaging<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.700> salad<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.359> was

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
after massaging it is the salad that was

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.729 
after massaging it is the salad that was
so<00:02:52.880> puffy<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.030> plump<00:02:54.450> before<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.410> sort<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
so puffy and plump before it sort of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.770 
so puffy and plump before it sort of
gets<00:02:55.859> really<00:02:56.220> condensed<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.600> might

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
gets really condensed and so it might

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.800 
gets really condensed and so it might
not<00:02:57.810> look<00:02:58.200> like<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.950> as<00:02:59.220> much<00:02:59.760> later<00:03:00.570> on

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
not look like you have as much later on

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.470 
not look like you have as much later on
but<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.530> one<00:03:02.070> note<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.609> there's<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.299> lot

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
but just one note is that there's a lot

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.900 
but just one note is that there's a lot
of<00:03:03.590> avocado<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.920> really<00:03:05.130> good<00:03:05.280> healthy<00:03:05.640> fats

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
of avocado and really good healthy fats

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.449 
of avocado and really good healthy fats
in<00:03:06.120> here<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.750> bit<00:03:06.989> more<00:03:07.680> dense<00:03:08.160> than

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
in here so it's a bit more dense than

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.890 
in here so it's a bit more dense than
you<00:03:08.730> might<00:03:08.940> imagine<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.630> might<00:03:09.750> look

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
you might imagine so it might look

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.259 
you might imagine so it might look
smaller<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:11.190> it's<00:03:11.760> still<00:03:11.970> going<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.209> be

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
smaller but it's still going to be

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.090 
smaller but it's still going to be
fulfilling<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.079> it's<00:03:13.170> totally<00:03:13.290> satisfying

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.069 

so<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.310> do<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.579> as<00:03:17.820> long<00:03:18.209> as<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.570> might

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
so you can do this as long as you might

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.170 
so you can do this as long as you might
need<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.350> usually<00:03:19.889> about<00:03:20.070> 30<00:03:20.430> seconds<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
need to usually about 30 seconds to a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.550 
need to usually about 30 seconds to a
minute<00:03:21.239> some<00:03:21.690> people<00:03:21.959> like<00:03:22.079> to<00:03:22.109> do<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> bit

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
minute some people like to do it a bit

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.819 
minute some people like to do it a bit
longer<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:24.109> this<00:03:25.109> is<00:03:25.260> kind<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> what<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
longer and this is kind of what the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.250 
longer and this is kind of what the
consistency<00:03:26.699> is<00:03:26.850> might<00:03:27.600> look<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.989> little

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
consistency is might look like a little

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.229 
consistency is might look like a little
odd<00:03:28.410> for<00:03:28.440> me<00:03:28.829> having<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.280> food<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.790> my<00:03:29.940> hands

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
odd for me having the food in my hands

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.590 
odd for me having the food in my hands
like<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.570> but<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.180> great<00:03:33.329> way

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
like that but it really is a great way

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
a lot different from the one you're

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.150 
a lot different from the one you're
going<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.540> bind<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.780> store<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.710> almost<00:04:51.860> feels

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
going to bind the store it almost feels

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.830 
going to bind the store it almost feels
like<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.430> little<00:04:52.729> bit<00:04:52.850> hollow<00:04:53.180> in<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.600> middle

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
like a little bit hollow in the middle

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.840 
like a little bit hollow in the middle
and<00:04:54.229> see<00:04:54.560> how<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.740> just<00:04:54.770> kind<00:04:55.070> of<00:04:55.130> twisted<00:04:55.639> that

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
and see how I just kind of twisted that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.080 
and see how I just kind of twisted that
and<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.630> popped<00:04:57.350> right<00:04:57.530> open<00:04:57.790> for<00:04:58.790> those<00:04:58.910> that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
and it popped right open for those that

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.700 
and it popped right open for those that
have<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.270> hard<00:04:59.510> time<00:04:59.690> digesting<00:04:59.990> nuts<00:05:00.560> they

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
have a hard time digesting nuts they

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.820 
have a hard time digesting nuts they
find<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.130> it's<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:02.030> lot<00:05:02.330> easier<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:03.530> digest

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
find that it's a lot easier to digest

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.710 
find that it's a lot easier to digest
and<00:05:04.250> process<00:05:04.490> when<00:05:05.030> they've<00:05:05.180> been<00:05:05.210> soaked

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
and process when they've been soaked

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.270 
and process when they've been soaked
overnight<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.350> then<00:05:06.440> putting<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.800> hydrator
