00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the skeleton data I made an attempt that

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
the skeleton data I made an attempt that
makes<00:00:47.700> clicks<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.210> curl<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.719> pointing<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.379> an

but<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.500> far<00:00:52.770> too<00:00:52.800> exhaustive<00:00:53.520> after<00:00:53.879> a

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.420 

finally<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.479> needed<00:05:36.870> to<00:05:37.050> save<00:05:37.319> and<00:05:37.620> load<00:05:37.650> the

finally I needed to save and load the

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.210 
finally I needed to save and load the
results<00:05:38.910> of<00:05:39.000> my<00:05:39.120> modeling<00:05:39.690> work<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:40.199> did<00:05:40.830> this

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
results of my modeling work I did this

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.480 
results of my modeling work I did this
using<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:41.940> same<00:05:42.180> syntax<00:05:42.449> as<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.620> OB<00:05:44.280> web

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
using the same syntax as the OB web

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.659 
using the same syntax as the OB web
format<00:05:45.440> so<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> model<00:05:46.889> can<00:05:47.190> be<00:05:47.250> interchanged

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
format so the model can be interchanged

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.839 
format so the model can be interchanged
directly<00:05:48.509> within<00:05:48.990> 3ds<00:05:49.560> max<00:05:49.919> or<00:05:50.190> other<00:05:50.430> 3d

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
directly within 3ds max or other 3d

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.850 
directly within 3ds max or other 3d

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.059 
applications
and<00:05:53.360> of<00:05:54.360> course<00:05:54.629> all<00:05:54.870> of<00:05:54.990> this<00:05:55.319> is<00:05:55.590> double<00:05:56.039> the

and of course all of this is double the
