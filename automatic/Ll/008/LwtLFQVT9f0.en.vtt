hand and pretty accepting of some pretty
extreme<00:01:02.030> looks<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.199> this<00:01:03.739> is<00:01:03.920> inspired<00:01:04.430> by<00:01:04.550> him

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000

extreme looks so this is inspired by him
I'll<00:01:05.360> also<00:01:05.750> mention<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.400> because<00:01:07.400> obviously

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
I'll also mention that because obviously

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.890 
I'll also mention that because obviously
I'm<00:01:08.780> not<00:01:08.810> Asian<00:01:09.680> at<00:01:09.979> all<00:01:10.040> whatsoever<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.450> his

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
I'm not Asian at all whatsoever so his

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.290 
I'm not Asian at all whatsoever so his
eyelid<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.040> stuff<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.550> different<00:01:13.790> than<00:01:14.090> mine

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
eyelid and stuff is different than mine

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.420 
eyelid and stuff is different than mine
so<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.780> have<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.380> double<00:01:15.650> eyelid<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.100> may<00:01:16.220> have

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
so I have the double eyelid and may have

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.580 
so I have the double eyelid and may have
the<00:01:16.700> more<00:01:16.909> hooded<00:01:17.240> eyelid<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:17.780> his<00:01:18.260> looks<00:01:18.500> a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
the more hooded eyelid so his looks a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.050 
the more hooded eyelid so his looks a
little<00:01:18.710> bit<00:01:18.920> different<00:01:19.370> so<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:19.580> kind<00:01:19.940> of

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
little bit different so I kind of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.539 
little bit different so I kind of
tweaked<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.080> little<00:01:21.110> bit<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.590> work<00:01:21.770> for<00:01:22.250> my

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
tweaked it a little bit to work for my

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.000 
tweaked it a little bit to work for my
eye<00:01:22.580> shape<00:01:23.210> but<00:01:23.510> if<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:23.960> do<00:01:24.200> have<00:01:24.440> hooded<00:01:24.740> lids

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
eye shape but if you do have hooded lids

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.980 
eye shape but if you do have hooded lids
and<00:01:25.370> you<00:01:26.000> watch<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.450> music<00:01:26.540> video<00:01:26.930> or

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
and you watch the music video or

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.139 
and you watch the music video or
something<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.560> could<00:01:27.740> probably<00:01:28.189> get<00:01:29.119> away

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
something you could probably get away

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.310 
something you could probably get away
with<00:01:29.299> this<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:29.570> little<00:01:29.689> bit<00:01:29.840> better<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.170> might

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
with this a little bit better it might

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.370 
with this a little bit better it might
look<00:01:30.469> more<00:01:30.700> like<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.299> he<00:01:32.509> was<00:01:32.689> wearing<00:01:32.899> than

um<00:02:09.520> bigger<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.700> lashes<00:02:11.150> whatever<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.530> think

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
um bigger the lashes whatever I I think

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.490
