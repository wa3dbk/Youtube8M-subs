00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
hi I'm Steve and I'm with i-94 RV and

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.150 
hi I'm Steve and I'm with i-94 RV and
this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.890> 2014<00:00:04.890> new<00:00:05.390> cyclone<00:00:06.770> 3110<00:00:07.770> toy

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
this is a 2014 new cyclone 3110 toy

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.730 
this is a 2014 new cyclone 3110 toy
hauler<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> really<00:00:09.660> cool<00:00:09.960> model<00:00:10.530> um

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
hauler so this is a really cool model um

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.620 
hauler so this is a really cool model um
it's<00:00:11.370> basically<00:00:11.550> what<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.090> would<00:00:12.210> consider

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
it's basically what I would consider

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.680 
it's basically what I would consider
kind<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.080> shorter<00:00:13.580> toyo<00:00:14.580> aller<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.360> 38

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
kind of a shorter toyo aller so it's 38

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.160 
kind of a shorter toyo aller so it's 38
feet<00:00:16.020> long<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:17.039> weighs<00:00:17.600> 13,000<00:00:18.600> six<00:00:18.930> on

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
feet long and it weighs 13,000 six on

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.349 
feet long and it weighs 13,000 six on
the<00:00:19.500> weight<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.789> little<00:00:21.000> bit<00:00:21.119> lighter

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the weight so it's a little bit lighter

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
the weight so it's a little bit lighter
a<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.020> easier<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> tow<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.310> let's<00:00:23.519> take

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
a little bit easier to tow so let's take

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.689 
a little bit easier to tow so let's take
a<00:00:23.730> walk<00:00:24.000> around<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.769> cyclone<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.010> definitely

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
point out about cyclone 2 is they choose

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580 
point out about cyclone 2 is they choose
not<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:15.119> flush<00:01:15.450> frameless<00:01:16.110> windows

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
not to use the flush frameless windows

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
not to use the flush frameless windows
they<00:01:16.860> use<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.850> standard<00:01:18.270> style<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
they use the you know standard style of

they use the you know standard style of
sliding<00:01:19.619> windows<00:01:20.220> which<00:01:20.939> i<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> great

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
sliding windows which i think is a great

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.830 
sliding windows which i think is a great
thing<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.729> huge<00:01:24.119> screens<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
thing because these have huge screens in

course we've got the patio deck which is
supported<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.500> cables<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.790> nice

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
supported by cables and it's a nice

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.999 
supported by cables and it's a nice
aluminum<00:01:33.509> gate<00:01:33.990> system<00:01:34.290> around<00:01:34.740> nice<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
aluminum gate system around nice and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.899 
aluminum gate system around nice and
lightweight<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.750> heavy

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
lightweight and it's a very heavy

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.810 
lightweight and it's a very heavy
Lippert<00:01:38.909> design<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.320> gate<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.340> real<00:01:41.549> heavy

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
Lippert design on the gate so real heavy

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.810 
Lippert design on the gate so real heavy
duty<00:01:44.060> there's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.149> letter<00:01:45.509> access<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> roof

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
duty there's a letter access to the roof

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.800 
duty there's a letter access to the roof
so<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.600> do

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so you can get up there and do

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
so you can get up there and do
maintenance<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.500> maybe<00:01:49.680> watch<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.130> race<00:01:50.310> or

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
something and right here you've got a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.520 
something and right here you've got a
fuel<00:01:53.100> station<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.079> can<00:01:55.170> fuel

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
fuel station so this is so you can fuel

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.639 
fuel station so this is so you can fuel
up<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.860> toys<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.149> feeds<00:01:58.079> fuel<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
up your toys and this also feeds fuel to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.830 
up your toys and this also feeds fuel to
the<00:01:58.770> generator<00:01:59.250> there's<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> fuel<00:02:00.270> fill<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the generator there's the fuel fill and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.899 
the generator there's the fuel fill and
that's<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.710> where<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.310> great<00:02:02.520> ankhs

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that's just where one of the great ankhs

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.069 
that's just where one of the great ankhs
is<00:02:04.729> Heartland<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.939> cyclone<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> zero

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
is Heartland the cyclone is a zero
