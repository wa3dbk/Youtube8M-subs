00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
size did you know that no I so I checked

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
size did you know that no I so I checked
out<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> according<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> Pro<00:00:40.079> Bowlers

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
out and according to the Pro Bowlers

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.650 
out and according to the Pro Bowlers
Association<00:00:40.890> no<00:00:41.550> ball<00:00:41.850> should<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.239> more<00:00:42.390> than

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
Association no ball should be more than

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
Association no ball should be more than
27<00:00:43.320> inches<00:00:43.590> nor<00:00:44.010> less<00:00:44.219> than<00:00:44.399> twenty<00:00:44.700> six<00:00:44.940> point

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
27 inches nor less than twenty six point

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.889 
27 inches nor less than twenty six point
seven<00:00:45.420> inches<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:47.129> circumference<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:47.940> um<00:00:48.180> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
seven inches in circumference so um so

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.240 
seven inches in circumference so um so
they<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> same<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
they all have to be the same and I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.290 
they all have to be the same and I
didn't<00:00:50.489> realize<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> only

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
didn't realize that so the only

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.790 
didn't realize that so the only
difference<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> amount<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.469> stuff<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
difference is the amount of stuff that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
difference is the amount of stuff that
they<00:00:53.100> put<00:00:53.280> inside<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> density<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
they put inside so the density of the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
they put inside so the density of the
bowling<00:00:55.020> ball<00:00:55.170> okay<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.100> example

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

see<00:01:04.199> float<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:04.949> sink<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.489> Wow<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.659> mate<00:01:07.049> look<00:01:07.380> at

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
see float or sink and Wow a mate look at

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.140 
see float or sink and Wow a mate look at
this<00:01:07.680> Oh

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
this Oh

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.600 
this Oh
even<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.570> animal<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.010> amazing

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
even the animal this is the amazing

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
even the animal this is the amazing
weight<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.180> anybody<00:01:12.479> asks<00:01:12.960> what's<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
weight so if anybody asks what's the the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
weight so if anybody asks what's the the
weight<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> twelve<00:01:14.310> pounds<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.450> amazing

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
weight that twelve pounds is the amazing

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960 
weight that twelve pounds is the amazing
weight<00:01:16.170> because<00:01:16.710> twelve<00:01:17.040> pounds<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.670> almost

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
weight because twelve pounds is almost

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.700 
weight because twelve pounds is almost
exactly<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.689> calculate<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> density<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
exactly if you calculate the density of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
exactly if you calculate the density of
it<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.130> almost<00:01:20.610> exactly<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it right almost exactly one and the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
it right almost exactly one and the
density<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.650> water<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.490> gram<00:01:23.520> per<00:01:24.180> cubic

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
density of water is one gram per cubic

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
density of water is one gram per cubic
centimeter<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:26.130> that's<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.850> amazing

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
centimeter so that's that's the amazing

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.850 
centimeter so that's that's the amazing
way<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:27.990> take<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> look<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.710> here

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
way so here take a look at this one here

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.840 
way so here take a look at this one here
let's<00:01:28.979> take<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> look<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> white<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
let's take a look at the white when the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.480 
let's take a look at the white when the
white<00:01:30.090> one<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.509> sixteen<00:01:31.110> pounds<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.189> grab<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
problem at all just because its overall

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
problem at all just because its overall
density<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.659> greater<00:01:45.869> than<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.470> it's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
density is greater than one so it's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.870 
density is greater than one so it's
really<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.490> point<00:01:47.759> three

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
really at about one point three

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
really at about one point three
somewhere<00:01:48.420> around<00:01:48.509> oh<00:01:48.720> yes<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.470> an<00:01:49.590> eight

these things that's great for kids to
kind<00:02:11.910> of<00:02:12.060> take<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> look<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.660> well<00:02:12.810> because

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
kind of take a look at as well because

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
kind of take a look at as well because
you<00:02:13.200> look<00:02:13.530> at

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you look at

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
you look at
see<00:02:13.920> an<00:02:13.980> aircraft<00:02:14.460> carrier<00:02:14.730> floats<00:02:15.180> how<00:02:15.360> does

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
see an aircraft carrier floats how does

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750 
see an aircraft carrier floats how does
that<00:02:15.630> work<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.050> Archimedes<00:02:16.980> says<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.430> when

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
that work and Archimedes says that when

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.800 
that work and Archimedes says that when
you<00:02:17.850> put<00:02:18.000> something<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.300> water<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.690> displaces

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you put something in water it displaces

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
you put something in water it displaces
its<00:02:19.410> weight<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.740> water<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.490> course

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
its weight in water and so of course

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.610 
its weight in water and so of course
it's<00:02:20.880> displacing<00:02:21.450> its<00:02:21.600> weight<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.900> water<00:02:22.080> but

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it's displacing its weight in water but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.350 
it's displacing its weight in water but
it<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:23.010> add<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.550> volume<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> bowling

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
it just add the volume of the bowling

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.210 
it just add the volume of the bowling
ball<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.540> bigger<00:02:24.900> than<00:02:25.080> 8<00:02:25.350> pounds<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:26.010> water

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
ball is bigger than 8 pounds of water

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.560 
ball is bigger than 8 pounds of water
you<00:02:26.670> think<00:02:26.850> about<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.210> so<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> magic<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.650> 12

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
you think about that so the magic is 12

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.390 
you think about that so the magic is 12
pounds<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:30.630> 12<00:02:31.020> sometimes<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.710> can<00:02:31.800> get<00:02:31.890> 12<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
pounds so 12 sometimes you can get 12 to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480 
pounds so 12 sometimes you can get 12 to
just<00:02:32.640> barely<00:02:33.360> float<00:02:34.040> let's<00:02:35.040> see<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.280> there's

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
just barely float let's see if there's

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.150 
just barely float let's see if there's
big<00:02:35.640> Infernus<00:02:36.390> see<00:02:36.870> they're<00:02:37.050> all<00:02:37.470> jockeying

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
big Infernus see they're all jockeying

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.100 
big Infernus see they're all jockeying
for<00:02:38.190> position<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.030> there's<00:02:39.210> how<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.600> goes<00:02:39.750> but

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
for position and there's how it goes but

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.570 
for position and there's how it goes but
just<00:02:40.320> going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.560> barely<00:02:40.830> float<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.220> way<00:02:41.400> and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
just going to barely float that way and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.310 
just going to barely float that way and
now<00:02:41.940> you've<00:02:42.150> answered<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.720> question<00:02:42.750> does<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
now you've answered the question does a

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.260 
now you've answered the question does a
bowling<00:02:43.710> ball<00:02:43.860> actually<00:02:44.160> float<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
bowling ball actually float and the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.150 
bowling ball actually float and the
answer<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.660> yes<00:02:45.900> anything<00:02:46.380> under<00:02:46.560> 12<00:02:47.070> pounds

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
answer is yes anything under 12 pounds

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.010 
answer is yes anything under 12 pounds
will<00:02:47.640> float<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.030> anything<00:02:48.240> over<00:02:48.600> 12<00:02:48.870> pounds

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
will float in anything over 12 pounds

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.480 
will float in anything over 12 pounds
will<00:02:49.350> sink<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.800> if<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.950> can<00:02:50.130> find<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
will sink and if you can find a

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.690 
will sink and if you can find a
12-pounder<00:02:51.120> it<00:02:51.240> just<00:02:51.930> barely<00:02:52.620> hovers<00:02:53.130> uh-huh

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
12-pounder it just barely hovers uh-huh
