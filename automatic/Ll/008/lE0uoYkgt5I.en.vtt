hey guys today I want to talk about this

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.890 
hey guys today I want to talk about this
abus<00:00:05.310> 83<00:00:06.150> 45<00:00:07.639> I'm<00:00:08.639> gonna<00:00:08.820> try<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.030> pick<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.599> for

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
abus 83 45 I'm gonna try to pick it for

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.580 
abus 83 45 I'm gonna try to pick it for
you<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:10.410> camera<00:00:10.969> these<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.179> high<00:00:12.960> security

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
you on camera these are high security

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.189 
you on camera these are high security
locks<00:00:13.799> they<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:16.820> serrated<00:00:17.820> pins<00:00:18.240> spool<00:00:18.900> pins

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
locks they have serrated pins spool pins

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.200 
locks they have serrated pins spool pins
I<00:00:19.619> mean<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:20.039> be<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> mix<00:00:20.490> mixture<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
I mean it can be a mix mixture of the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
I mean it can be a mix mixture of the
two<00:00:21.390> I've<00:00:21.630> uh<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.830> picked<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.400> lock<00:00:23.580> already

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
two I've uh I picked this lock already

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
two I've uh I picked this lock already
it<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.750> kind<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.960> weird<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.410> sense<00:00:25.619> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it it's kind of weird in the sense that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.400 
it it's kind of weird in the sense that
I<00:00:26.010> don't<00:00:26.189> get<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> false<00:00:26.730> start<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I don't get a false start from it or a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.339 
I don't get a false start from it or a
false<00:00:28.800> set<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> full<00:00:29.550> start<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.510> false<00:00:31.050> set

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
false set on a full start a false set

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.420 
false set on a full start a false set
being<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> lock<00:00:32.430> falls<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:34.430> about

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
being that the lock falls over about

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.549 
being that the lock falls over about
thirty<00:00:35.760> degrees<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.630> then<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.230> set<00:00:37.440> your

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
thirty degrees and then you set your

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.580 
thirty degrees and then you set your
spool<00:00:37.860> pins<00:00:38.149> this<00:00:39.149> has<00:00:39.390> full<00:00:39.690> pins<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.260> when<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
spool pins this has full pins but when I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
spool pins this has full pins but when I
go<00:00:40.800> through<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:42.000> usually<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.480> opens<00:00:42.899> so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
go through it it usually just opens so

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.029 
go through it it usually just opens so
it's<00:00:44.160> kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> weird<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.670> regard<00:00:46.039> I'm

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it's kind of weird in that regard I'm

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's kind of weird in that regard I'm
also<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.460> hold<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.940> while<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.539> cuz

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
also gonna hold this while I do it cuz

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.119 
also gonna hold this while I do it cuz
I've<00:00:48.870> been<00:00:49.020> having<00:00:49.350> uh<00:00:49.440> some<00:00:49.469> problems<00:00:50.039> with

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I've been having uh some problems with

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.540 
I've been having uh some problems with
the<00:00:50.219> vise<00:00:51.530> people<00:00:52.530> want<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.920> me<00:00:53.070> actually

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the vise people want to see me actually

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
the vise people want to see me actually
pick<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> lock<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:55.050> went<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> real

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pick a lock like I went out in the real

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
pick a lock like I went out in the real
world<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.670> gonna<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
world so I'm just gonna do it like I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
world so I'm just gonna do it like I
normally<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:58.039> I'll<00:00:59.039> bring<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> vise<00:00:59.520> back

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
normally do I'll bring the vise back

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.389 
normally do I'll bring the vise back
probably<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.570> some<00:01:00.840> smaller<00:01:01.140> locks<00:01:01.500> when<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
probably on some smaller locks when I

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.980 
probably on some smaller locks when I
can't<00:01:03.329> hold<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.780> focus<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.559> so

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
can't hold it and focus like this so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
can't hold it and focus like this so
start<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> back<00:01:07.400> just<00:01:08.400> work<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.790> way

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
start in the back just work your way

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
start in the back just work your way
forward<00:01:10.850> sometimes<00:01:11.850> you'll<00:01:12.150> set<00:01:12.360> some<00:01:12.570> normal

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
forward sometimes you'll set some normal

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:24.560 
forward sometimes you'll set some normal
binders<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.619> way<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> locks

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
binders that way and what this locks

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.240 
binders that way and what this locks
sometimes<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.710> while<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> get

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
sometimes can take a while to get

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
sometimes can take a while to get
through<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> spools<00:01:29.329> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> end<00:01:30.630> but

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
through all the spools at the end but

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.660 
through all the spools at the end but
like<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.860> said<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.159> one<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:32.640> reason

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
like I said this one for some reason

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.800 
like I said this one for some reason
doesn't<00:01:33.180> fall<00:01:33.740> set<00:01:35.390> just<00:01:36.390> opens<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.540> kind

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
doesn't fall set just opens this is kind

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.160 
doesn't fall set just opens this is kind
of<00:01:39.869> odd<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:44.869> normally<00:01:45.869> you'll<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.140> through

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
of odd so normally you'll go through

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.499 
of odd so normally you'll go through
there's<00:01:46.590> five<00:01:46.829> pins<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.240> you'll

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
there's five pins in here and you'll

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
there's five pins in here and you'll
you'll<00:01:48.840> pick<00:01:49.049> through<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:50.070> you'll<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you'll pick through it and you'll have a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
you'll pick through it and you'll have a
false<00:01:50.790> set<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:53.149> then<00:01:54.149> you'll<00:01:54.329> lift<00:01:54.540> those

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
false set and then you'll lift those

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.830 
false set and then you'll lift those
last<00:01:55.439> couple<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.829> spools<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.490> it'll<00:01:57.450> flip<00:01:57.659> over

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
last couple of spools up it'll flip over

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660 
last couple of spools up it'll flip over
the<00:01:58.049> rest<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.490> that's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the rest of the way but this one that's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
the rest of the way but this one that's
uh<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.619> opens<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.079> uh

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
uh it just opens so uh

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.010 
uh it just opens so uh
I<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.420> might<00:02:06.720> need<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I don't know I think this might need to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.160 
I don't know I think this might need to
be<00:02:07.110> repend<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.830> might<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.840> might<00:02:09.990> have

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
be repend it might have it might have

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.370 
be repend it might have it might have
like<00:02:10.500> an<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:11.330> bidding<00:02:12.330> that's<00:02:12.600> not<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.290> know

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
like an a bidding that's not you know

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.650 
like an a bidding that's not you know
not<00:02:13.530> jagged<00:02:14.130> inside<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.610> might<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.540> know

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
not jagged inside it might be you know

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660 
not jagged inside it might be you know
kind<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> master<00:02:16.800> lock<00:02:16.920> word<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.489> has<00:02:17.520> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
kind of like a master lock word it has a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.850 
kind of like a master lock word it has a
higher<00:02:18.060> pin<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> back<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.020> then<00:02:19.110> pretty

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
higher pin in the back and then pretty
