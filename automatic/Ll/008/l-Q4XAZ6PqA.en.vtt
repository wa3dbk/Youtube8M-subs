00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
reason why some of these factors going

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
reason why some of these factors going
to<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.949> quite<00:01:02.129> slow<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.090> actually

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
to be quite slow it's I was actually

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.870 
to be quite slow it's I was actually
like<00:01:04.140> uploading<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.070> road<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.430> glory<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like uploading the road to glory at the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.130 
like uploading the road to glory at the
same<00:01:06.119> time<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.200> 5<00:01:07.619> k-10<00:01:08.119> 60fps<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:10.020> as

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
same time and it's in 5 k-10 60fps so as

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
same time and it's in 5 k-10 60fps so as
you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.409> imagine<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.010> does<00:01:11.159> take<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.520> quite<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you can imagine it does take up quite a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
you can imagine it does take up quite a
lot<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.150> internet<00:01:12.479> speed<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> apologize<00:01:13.470> for

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
lot of internet speed so I apologize for

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
lot of internet speed so I apologize for
the<00:01:13.799> packs<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.100> quite<00:01:14.280> slow<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.210> yeah<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the packs are quite slow but yeah I

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240 
the packs are quite slow but yeah I
think<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.380> were<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:16.860> awesome<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
think they were just too awesome to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
think they were just too awesome to
leave<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:18.240> first<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:19.970> today<00:01:21.049> he

leave out all right first back today he

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:22.999 
leave out all right first back today he
has<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> reason<00:01:22.470> why<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.680> shouldn't<00:01:22.890> be

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
