makes kangen water different this is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
makes kangen water different this is
what<00:00:34.440> puts<00:00:34.649> kangen<00:00:35.130> water<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.910> group<00:00:36.180> by

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
what puts kangen water in a group by

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.110 
what puts kangen water in a group by
itself<00:00:36.860> there's<00:00:37.860> three<00:00:38.100> main<00:00:38.370> properties<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
itself there's three main properties to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
itself there's three main properties to
the<00:00:39.239> water<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.660> make<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> healthy

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the water that make this a healthy

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.549 
the water that make this a healthy
medical<00:00:41.399> grade<00:00:41.450> wellness<00:00:42.450> water<00:00:42.719> let's<00:00:43.260> start

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
medical grade wellness water let's start

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.830 
medical grade wellness water let's start
right<00:00:43.710> over<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.579> high<00:00:44.789> alkaline<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
right over here it's high alkaline you

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840 
right over here it's high alkaline you
see<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> side<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> scale<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.370> acid

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
see on the side of the scale the acid

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
see on the side of the scale the acid
side<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.809> sink<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.320> side<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
side that's the sink this side the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
side that's the sink this side the
outline<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.390> healthy<00:00:51.840> side<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> scale

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
outline is the healthy side of the scale

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.060 
outline is the healthy side of the scale
now<00:00:53.160> keep<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.520> mind<00:00:53.579> seven<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> neutral<00:00:55.070> right

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
now keep in mind seven is neutral right

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
now keep in mind seven is neutral right
down<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> middle<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.660> a

against the fence what happens so you

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.570

very long everything takes place in
water<00:06:05.590> and

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
water and

with water in our bodies oxygen we could

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.950 
with water in our bodies oxygen we could

oxygen in our bodies so keep in mind
that<00:06:13.690> micro<00:06:14.440> cluster<00:06:14.860> is<00:06:14.979> a<00:06:15.100> really<00:06:15.610> important

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120

don't<00:06:20.590> know<00:06:20.650> if<00:06:20.740> you<00:06:20.830> can<00:06:20.949> see<00:06:21.130> this<00:06:21.250> up<00:06:21.490> very

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
don't know if you can see this up very

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.060 
don't know if you can see this up very
very<00:06:22.270> good<00:06:22.389> from<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:23.320> distance<00:06:23.889> of<00:06:23.979> the

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
very good from the distance of the

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.950 
very good from the distance of the
camera<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.669> you've<00:06:24.970> got<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.150> large<00:06:25.419> cluster

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
camera and you've got a large cluster

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.960 
camera and you've got a large cluster
here<00:06:26.169> and<00:06:26.410> then<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:26.620> cell<00:06:26.860> wall<00:06:27.190> so<00:06:27.759> what

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
here and then the cell wall so what

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.120 
here and then the cell wall so what
happens<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.479> those<00:06:28.630> those<00:06:29.259> small<00:06:29.680> hexagonal

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
happens is those those small hexagonal

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.150 
happens is those those small hexagonal
shapes<00:06:30.699> get<00:06:31.240> into<00:06:31.630> the<00:06:31.720> cell<00:06:31.990> much<00:06:32.740> quicker

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
shapes get into the cell much quicker

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.960 
shapes get into the cell much quicker
much<00:06:33.880> better<00:06:34.270> okay<00:06:34.990> this<00:06:35.650> is<00:06:35.949> the<00:06:36.550> third

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
much better okay this is the third

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.580 
much better okay this is the third
property<00:06:37.270> of<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.660> water<00:06:37.900> so<00:06:38.110> keep<00:06:38.289> in<00:06:38.410> mind

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
property of the water so keep in mind

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.640 
property of the water so keep in mind
you've<00:06:38.770> got<00:06:38.949> your<00:06:39.310> high<00:06:39.490> alkaline<00:06:40.030> your
