first<00:00:12.210> up<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.500> elf<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:14.099> smudge<00:00:14.610> brush

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
first up I have the elf a smudge brush

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.230 
first up I have the elf a smudge brush
this<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.809> exactly<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.650> my<00:00:17.010> Sigma<00:00:17.550> smudge

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
this is exactly like my Sigma smudge

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.800 
this is exactly like my Sigma smudge
brush<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.680> got<00:00:20.100> any<00:00:20.400> precision<00:00:20.850> ID<00:00:21.390> kit

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
brush that I got any precision ID kit

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.529 
brush that I got any precision ID kit
but<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.350> probably<00:00:22.619> like<00:00:23.220> double<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.789> size<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
but it's probably like double the size I

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.630 
but it's probably like double the size I
probably<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.260> another<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.920> similar<00:00:26.369> but

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
probably do have another one similar but

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160 
probably do have another one similar but
this<00:00:26.970> would<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.480> good<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.990> lower

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
this would be really good for the lower

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.290 
this would be really good for the lower
lash<00:00:28.410> line<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> just<00:00:29.400> smudge<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.210> make

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
lash line to just smudge it out and make

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.299 
lash line to just smudge it out and make
it<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.480> little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.810> smoky<00:00:31.140> next<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.160> have

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it a little bit smoky next time I have

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
it a little bit smoky next time I have
this<00:00:32.489> small<00:00:32.610> angled<00:00:33.180> brush<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.780> will

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
this small angled brush this will

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.920 
this small angled brush this will
probably<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.790> good<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.390> maybe<00:00:36.600> drawing

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
probably just be good for maybe drawing

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.930 
probably just be good for maybe drawing
the<00:00:37.079> lower<00:00:37.230> lash<00:00:37.500> line<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:37.950> smudging<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the lower lash line or smudging out the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.530 
the lower lash line or smudging out the
top<00:00:39.390> lash<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.590> wouldn't<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.010> good<00:00:41.219> for

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
top lash it wouldn't be good for

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.389 
top lash it wouldn't be good for
precision<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.960> don't<00:00:43.170> believe<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.010> hairs<00:00:44.219> on

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
precision I don't believe the hairs on

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.639 
precision I don't believe the hairs on
it<00:00:44.430> look<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:45.120> stray<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:46.350> i<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it look a little bit stray here i have a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.119 
it look a little bit stray here i have a
sensational<00:00:47.579> coral<00:00:48.570> sunset<00:00:49.050> gel<00:00:49.410> polish<00:00:49.800> i

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
sensational coral sunset gel polish i

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920

think this was around like ten dollars
or<00:00:52.079> something<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.530> i<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> wanted<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.280> coral

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
haven't tried it so i don't know what

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
haven't tried it so i don't know what
it's<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.049> most<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.890> stuff<00:01:14.070> haven't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it's like most of this stuff haven't

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's like most of this stuff haven't
actually<00:01:14.580> tried<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.360> I've<00:01:15.479> got<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.659> concealer

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
actually tried here I've got a concealer

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.399 
actually tried here I've got a concealer
brush<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.040> tiny<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.840> very<00:01:19.110> small

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
brush and it is tiny it's a very small

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.410 
brush and it is tiny it's a very small
concealer<00:01:19.830> brush<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.390> be

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
concealer brush but this one would be

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
concealer brush but this one would be
good<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.950> maybe<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.670> inner

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
good I think for maybe like the inner

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170 
good I think for maybe like the inner
corner<00:01:24.299> highlight<00:01:24.330> for<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.320> eye<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:26.180> maybe

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
corner highlight for your eye or maybe

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.749 
corner highlight for your eye or maybe
even<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.509> lip<00:01:27.780> brush<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.320> if<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> Alpha

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
even a lip brush as if I have the Alpha

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.120 
even a lip brush as if I have the Alpha
