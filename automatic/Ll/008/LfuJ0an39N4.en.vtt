the<00:00:36.149> last<00:00:36.360> video<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.780> had<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> Ballard<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the last video I had the Ballard in the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
the last video I had the Ballard in the
gimlet<00:00:38.670> tortoise<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.719> didn't<00:00:40.079> think<00:00:40.200> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
gimlet tortoise but I didn't think I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.410 
gimlet tortoise but I didn't think I
would<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.590> wear<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> color<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
would actually wear it in that color so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.840 
would actually wear it in that color so
I<00:00:42.450> had<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.930> come<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.620> time<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.489> sugar

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I had it come out this time in the sugar

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
I had it come out this time in the sugar
maple<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.239> only<00:00:45.390> comes<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.140> colors<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
maple it only comes in two colors I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
maple it only comes in two colors I
believe<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.280> least<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:48.090> did<00:00:48.270> when<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.510> places<00:00:48.960> so

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
believe at least it did when I places so

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
believe at least it did when I places so
if<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.200> does<00:00:49.289> now<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.649> sorry<00:00:49.920> um<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.670> got

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
if it does now I'm sorry um and I got

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.139 
if it does now I'm sorry um and I got
the<00:00:51.239> Ballard<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> sugar<00:00:52.530> maple<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.940> only

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the Ballard in the sugar maple the only

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.220 
the Ballard in the sugar maple the only
thing<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.510> feel<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.750> they're<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
thing is I feel like they're just a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
thing is I feel like they're just a
little<00:00:55.350> too<00:00:55.469> round<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> feel<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
little too round that I feel like they

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
little too round that I feel like they
looked<00:00:56.969> better<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.230> gimlet

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
looked better on me in the gimlet

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.939 
looked better on me in the gimlet
tortoise<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.180> were<00:01:00.239> too<00:01:00.719> busy<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.829> me

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
tortoise but they were too busy for me

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.319 
tortoise but they were too busy for me
but<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:02.940> look<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
but this is what they look like in the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
but this is what they look like in the
sugar<00:01:03.600> maple<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.830> you're
