00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 have to update the control people 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.689
 the console had several and several and several 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.850
 no updates and no control 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.960
 updated because it happens let's 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.210
 update the control that this is and asks 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.630

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.240

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.340

 It will kind of shut down the console and it goes 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.069

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.200
