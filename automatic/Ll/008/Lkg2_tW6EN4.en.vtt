 romance then you want to learn to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.340
 cultivate and then it is good to be with 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.590
 embolar and nothing and with these polka dots 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:30.000
 even holding hair will do 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:32.550

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.829
 you make the tiara it 's good to separate a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.629
 very thick back and stay 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.399
 too thick if you get too thin

 to sanz vote for you hold on 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:33.810
 with silicone elastic and makes 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.810
 exactly the same thing on the other side 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.890
 so the two braces I'll stay like this 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:50.100
 To do the tiara, you braid. 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.100
 by head so and fasten with clips 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.549
 and does the same thing with the other trans 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 so you can leave the braid on the tail 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.750
 even by the horse or by the hair 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.640

 It was very beautiful too. 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.680
