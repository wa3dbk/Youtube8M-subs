 cinnamon cloves and condensed milk to taste 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.000
 for the lining or the filling we are going to 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.640
 take 2 cups of cottage cheese 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.870

 roasted peanuts 2 cups plums 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.780
 You pass a cup of shredded coconut a 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.120
 apple in small cubes and a banana 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.910

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.329
 covered with pumpkin covered biznaga 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.649
 covered with sweet potato 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.850
 everything that has been covered in sweet 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 because in fact it is covered in sweet 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.190
 let's finish incorporating the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.180
 garrison and I added 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.180
 the banana 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.909
 and the apple and now what are we going to 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.909
 do is the following in a refractory 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.600
 let's put the bread 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 a bread and butter base 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.210
 this bread gets it in the supermarket 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 if you want to avoid the fatigue of toasting 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.120
 you bread in the village I still know for 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.370
 that you are the artisanal capacity of 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.540
 the women made the bread 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.310
 the house bread old bread after 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.530
 they cut after the others were 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.210
 and then they did capirotadas 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.920
 and now we can get it 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.550
 Supermarket 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.220
 ready not to pass or bake 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.500
 so there's no excuse 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.510
 put the butter here we are going to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.510
 put the garnish yes 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.300
 when we add 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.650
 honey with the same heat of honey is 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.000
 will melt the butter is going to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.400
 melt that that will hydrate the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.980
 raisins and plums and this will stay 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.980
 delicious let's put another layer of bread 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.490
 I think this bread was not a roll 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.860
 generally what you should not buy in 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.120
 the supermarket is bolillo but it seems 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.780
 they gave me bread for hamburger 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.780
 It is useful too 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.519
 let's put another piece of bread we will 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.519
 repeat the operation 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.320
 until the mold is covered 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.530
 with all the ingredients 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.450
 good upside down 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.569
 and then we are going to bathe 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.879
