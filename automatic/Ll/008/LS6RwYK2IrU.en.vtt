00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.510
 are you not waiting for extensive smartphones that can do anything 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.510
 also cost hundreds of euros then there are plenty of other options 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.289
 Nokia eighteen hundred, for example, is that option 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.460
 for just over three children you have a stylish device when pieter 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.409
 dismet 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.199
 ma the belgian function is the most important thing then again 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:23.800
 good 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 luckily I found a solution for that, so keep looking 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.220
 at the same time an eye is eighteen hundred with a device of the same price and 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.980
 very convincing in terms of design speed 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.370
 the different types of plastic alternate what a beautiful design 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.630
 delivered and it is also packs against each other 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.780
 The color screen is easy to see, even outside in bright sunlight 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.840
 viewing angles leaves nothing to be desired 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.200
 This device should of course not have its extensive extra functions 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.310
 apart from which simple games there are actually only two worth 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.000
 to name 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.250
 one is a flashlight 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.220
 he sings to operate do not forget a lot of light but good if you go sometime 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.330
 looking for a picture of women in the dark because it is on it 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.160
 another is the fm radio the device does not play any mp3s but on 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.200
 the radio started listening to music 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.590
 you naturally need the earbuds that also serve as an antenna 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.680
 but it is a pity that the supplied studs 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.630
 very bad they are not comfortable and a draw I mean 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.260
 but in case of emergency the eighteen hundred space for other text messages and calls 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.310
 but the first can be excellent 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.200
 Tightly styled keyboard usually means that the type is not like that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 goes very well but at least it doesn't seem to be that I can but me 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.240
 thick thumb excellent heading 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.100
 but with an earpiece 18 around it is a completely different story 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 anyway the microphone is not very good the other end of the line becomes one 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.750
 hope crackling and hopes background noise ma the loudspeaker of devices says 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 lousy anyway I hear myself better than the person on the other side of the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.350
 line but also bystanders to be able to leave word for word according to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 jaap edenhal 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.350
 good afternoon you with loud and clear translate for everyone here in the room 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.339
 Fortunately, the problem of poor sound quality is easy to solve 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.669
 because if you have devices will be a car against your ear 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.669
 both riders to assist that 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.829
 with an eye 800 is simply the best that makes hope come alive 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.509
 all riders 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:27.630
 Yes indeed 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.029
 so bublÃ© stereo and 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.630
 also a 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.579
 there were 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.579
 good afternoon all year with tennis 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.519
 wonderfully allowed 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.359
 nice is that already happens after the winter break 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.459
 also and that is not really a solution 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.489
 the nokia 800 the course not much he looks nice if you can not do anything with it 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.789
 call yes now and then a bit 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:57.389
 so it seems better devices such as Nokia 23 23 and also the rest 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.519
 a sun of 11 70 costs about the same thank you good call 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.739
 for that matter, I would not have been this eighteen hundred you note
