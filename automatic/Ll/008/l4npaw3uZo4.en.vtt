it's all preference for example if you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.679 
it's all preference for example if you
don't<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> regular<00:01:18.000> scope<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
don't like the regular scope and you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.880 
don't like the regular scope and you
like<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> thermal<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.770> go

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
like the thermal one you can just go

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.890 
like the thermal one you can just go
ahead<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.280> throw<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.030> awning<00:01:21.299> instead<00:01:21.720> it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
ahead and throw that awning instead it's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.770 
ahead and throw that awning instead it's
not<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.369> complete<00:01:24.330> guide<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
how to use these weapon it's just like a

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.609 
how to use these weapon it's just like a
rough<00:01:26.189> rough<00:01:27.000> guide<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> how<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:28.020> may<00:01:28.170> want<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
rough rough guide and how we may want to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
rough rough guide and how we may want to
and<00:01:28.920> how<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.250> may<00:01:29.549> find<00:01:29.880> success<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.960> using

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and how you may find success when using

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.050 
and how you may find success when using
this<00:01:31.290> weapon<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:32.130> go-to<00:01:32.369> attachments<00:01:32.939> with

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
this weapon so my go-to attachments with

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.819 
this weapon so my go-to attachments with
a<00:01:33.090> sniper<00:01:33.299> rifle<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.320> always<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
a sniper rifle it's always the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.410 
a sniper rifle it's always the
ballistics<00:01:35.220> cpu<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.729> reason<00:01:35.970> being<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
ballistics cpu the reason being is it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420 
ballistics cpu the reason being is it
reduces<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.140> makes<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> easy<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> hit

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
reduces this way makes it easy to hit

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
reduces this way makes it easy to hit
people<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.270> makes<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.659> overall

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
people and it just makes it an overall

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.020 
people and it just makes it an overall
better<00:01:40.110> gun<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:41.310> course<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> use<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> fast

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
better gun and of course I use the fast

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
better gun and of course I use the fast
mags<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> DSR<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.439> one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
mags on the DSR because one of these one

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.469 
mags on the DSR because one of these one
of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> guns<00:01:44.220> only<00:01:44.460> downfalls<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> fact

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of the guns only downfalls is the fact

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
of the guns only downfalls is the fact
that<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> only<00:01:45.780> has<00:01:45.990> five<00:01:46.229> bullets<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that it only has five bullets and the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
that it only has five bullets and the
reload<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.700> slow<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.270> find

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
reload is really slow so you find

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.420 
reload is really slow so you find
yourself<00:01:48.810> reloading<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
yourself reloading a lot of the time and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.710 
yourself reloading a lot of the time and
one<00:01:50.610> way<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.970> around<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.479> use<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
one way to get around this is to use the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.929 
one way to get around this is to use the
fast<00:01:51.990> mags<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.920> course<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
fast mags or of course you can use the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
fast mags or of course you can use the
extended<00:01:54.299> mags<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> it'll<00:01:54.840> make<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.200> reload

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
extended mags and it'll make you reload

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.499 
extended mags and it'll make you reload
less<00:01:55.829> often<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.939> prefer<00:01:57.060> using<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
less often but I just prefer using the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
less often but I just prefer using the
fast<00:01:57.689> mags<00:01:57.899> attachment<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.649> perks<00:01:58.860> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
fast mags attachment and the perks that

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920

snapping game and I was streaming
yesterday<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:24.860> think<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.069> mention<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:25.579> I

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
yesterday I think I mention this but I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.309 
yesterday I think I mention this but I
was<00:02:25.730> dreaming<00:02:26.000> yesterday<00:02:26.329> going<00:02:26.900> for<00:02:27.049> diamond

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
was dreaming yesterday going for diamond

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.020 
was dreaming yesterday going for diamond
sniper<00:02:27.530> rifles<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.340> was<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.640> was<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:28.909> much

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
sniper rifles and it was it was so much

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.420 
sniper rifles and it was it was so much
fun<00:02:29.090> because<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.659> when<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.409> snipe<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.950> don't<00:02:31.129> tend

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
fun because I when I snipe I don't tend

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.099 
fun because I when I snipe I don't tend
to<00:02:31.489> get<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:31.909> high<00:02:32.450> scoring<00:02:32.720> game<00:02:32.810> plays

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
to get really high scoring game plays

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.539 
to get really high scoring game plays
because<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.349> play<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.769> aggressively<00:02:34.280> with

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
because I play really aggressively with

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.250 
because I play really aggressively with
the<00:02:34.670> snipers<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.659> makes<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.019> french

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
the snipers but it makes for a french

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.690 
the snipers but it makes for a french
stream<00:02:36.439> to<00:02:36.620> watch<00:02:36.739> in<00:02:36.890> my<00:02:36.920> opinion<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.579> was
