00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
to change a preset I'll just show you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280 
to change a preset I'll just show you
quickly<00:02:14.180> you

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
one of the features that we're pretty

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.479 
one of the features that we're pretty
pleased<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.319> with<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.799> machine<00:02:31.189> is<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
pleased with with this machine is the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.569 
pleased with with this machine is the
fact<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.780> able<00:02:33.079> to<00:02:33.319> use<00:02:33.650> cycles<00:02:34.340> per

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
fact that you are able to use cycles per

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.619 
fact that you are able to use cycles per
second<00:02:35.000> as<00:02:35.319> your<00:02:36.319> measurement<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.209> when

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
second as your measurement so when

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.940 
second as your measurement so when
you're<00:02:38.750> on<00:02:38.870> cycles<00:02:39.290> per<00:02:39.440> second<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.860> you're

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
you're on cycles per second and you're

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.949 
you're on cycles per second and you're
on<00:02:40.040> advanced<00:02:40.610> you'll<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.390> amps<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
on advanced you'll have the amps and the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.080 
on advanced you'll have the amps and the
voltage<00:02:42.349> now<00:02:42.829> cycles<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.459> only<00:02:43.640> relevant<00:02:44.060> to

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
voltage now cycles is only relevant to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.259 
voltage now cycles is only relevant to
rotary<00:02:44.450> machines<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:46.310> set<00:02:46.519> cycles<00:02:47.030> per

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
rotary machines and to set cycles per

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.180 
rotary machines and to set cycles per
second<00:02:47.659> up<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.290> actually<00:02:48.620> need<00:02:48.769> to<00:02:48.799> calibrate

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
second up you actually need to calibrate

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.069 
second up you actually need to calibrate
your<00:02:49.640> machine<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.329> I'll<00:02:50.420> show<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:50.930> a
