I<00:04:04.280> mean<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.670> falls<00:04:04.940> in<00:04:05.150> line<00:04:05.360> with<00:04:05.390> what<00:04:05.630> you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
I mean it falls in line with what you

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.340 
I mean it falls in line with what you
can<00:04:06.049> expect<00:04:06.410> from<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.739> industry<00:04:06.980> for<00:04:07.190> sure

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
can expect from the industry for sure

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.180 
can expect from the industry for sure
also<00:04:09.350> i<00:04:09.380> think<00:04:09.560> i<00:04:10.450> think<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.319> form<00:04:12.920> factor

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
also i think i think the the form factor

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.060 
also i think i think the the form factor
so<00:04:13.730> if<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.060> look<00:04:14.209> at<00:04:14.390> something<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:15.070> the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
so if you look at something like the

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.940 
so if you look at something like the
