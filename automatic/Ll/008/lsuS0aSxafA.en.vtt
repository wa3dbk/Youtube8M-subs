00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
review if you look at my channel I only

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.600 
review if you look at my channel I only
have<00:00:42.960> four<00:00:43.200> subscribers<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.010> hardly<00:00:44.460> any

have four subscribers and hardly any

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.029 
have four subscribers and hardly any
abuse<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> mean<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.559> pretty<00:00:46.829> much

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
abuse so I mean it's pretty much

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.010 
abuse so I mean it's pretty much
pointless<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.300> paying<00:00:48.570> me<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
pointless for people to be paying me to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.420 
pointless for people to be paying me to
make<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.200> review<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> products<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.309> know

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
make a review on the products you know
it<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.239> pointless<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.100> pay<00:00:53.100> me<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> make

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it would be pointless to pay me to make

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.279 
it would be pointless to pay me to make
reviews<00:00:54.000> because<00:00:54.420> nobody<00:00:54.719> watches<00:00:54.930> my<00:00:55.020> videos
