you<00:04:17.190> get<00:04:17.370> stuck<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.910> well<00:04:18.419> my<00:04:18.539> point<00:04:18.750> is

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
you get stuck in the well my point is

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.949 
you get stuck in the well my point is
that<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:20.070> has<00:04:20.609> some<00:04:20.880> really<00:04:21.090> hard<00:04:21.419> moments<00:04:21.510> for

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that it has some really hard moments for

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.890 
that it has some really hard moments for
no<00:04:22.079> reason<00:04:22.580> also<00:04:23.580> as<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:24.060> said<00:04:24.090> before<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.690> gas

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
no reason also as I said before the gas

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.629 
no reason also as I said before the gas
kills<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.410> way<00:04:25.560> too<00:04:25.620> fast<00:04:25.950> actually<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.430> didn't

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
kills you way too fast actually I didn't

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.460 
kills you way too fast actually I didn't
say<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:26.910> before<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:27.360> I'll<00:04:27.479> say<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.660> now<00:04:27.900> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
say that before but I'll say it now the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.290 
say that before but I'll say it now the
gas<00:04:28.710> there's<00:04:29.220> gas<00:04:29.460> all<00:04:29.700> around<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> city

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
gas there's gas all around the city

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.020 
gas there's gas all around the city
because<00:04:30.599> it's<00:04:30.630> toxic<00:04:31.289> it's<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.490> trying<00:04:32.849> to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
because it's toxic it's just trying to

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.150 
because it's toxic it's just trying to
keep<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.240> into<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> linear<00:04:34.080> path<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.830> by<00:04:34.950> doing

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
keep you into a linear path and by doing

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.980 
keep you into a linear path and by doing
that<00:04:35.310> if<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.669> go<00:04:35.789> outside<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.450> linear<00:04:36.780> path

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
that if you go outside this linear path

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.960 
that if you go outside this linear path
no<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.320> doesn't<00:04:37.590> say<00:04:37.740> turn<00:04:37.979> back<00:04:38.250> when<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.849> does

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
no it doesn't say turn back when it does

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.640 
no it doesn't say turn back when it does
is<00:04:39.210> suffocate<00:04:39.690> your<00:04:39.840> ass<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.289> then<00:04:40.349> you<00:04:40.500> gotta

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
is suffocate your ass and then you gotta

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.310 
is suffocate your ass and then you gotta
restart<00:04:41.130> on<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.520> checkpoint<00:04:42.060> not<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> very

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
restart on the checkpoint not a very

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.680 
restart on the checkpoint not a very
good<00:04:43.410> idea<00:04:43.650> next<00:04:44.340> time<00:04:44.520> just<00:04:44.550> say<00:04:44.849> go

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
good idea next time just say go

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.480 
good idea next time just say go
backwards<00:04:46.320> that's<00:04:46.650> all<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.860> guys<00:04:46.979> say<00:04:47.220> or

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
backwards that's all you guys say or

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.909 
backwards that's all you guys say or
visible<00:04:48.389> wall<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.840> don't<00:04:49.229> want<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.470> die<00:04:49.500> every

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
time I go up too high on a building

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.230 
time I go up too high on a building
because<00:04:51.930> I'm<00:04:52.050> running<00:04:52.320> away<00:04:52.500> from<00:04:52.560> men<00:04:52.800> race

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
but there are some really cool moves

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.310 
but there are some really cool moves
with<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.889> arm<00:04:56.220> especially<00:04:57.120> my<00:04:57.630> two<00:04:57.690> fair<00:04:58.050> ones

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.469 
with the arm especially my two fair ones
are<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.770> where<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.180> throw<00:05:00.180> something

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
are the one where you throw something

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.240 
are the one where you throw something
with<00:05:00.719> the<00:05:00.810> arms<00:05:01.080> such<00:05:01.229> as<00:05:01.380> grabbing<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.860> car<00:05:02.099> and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
with the arms such as grabbing a car and

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.950 
with the arms such as grabbing a car and
then<00:05:02.340> flinging<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.849> into<00:05:03.270> something<00:05:03.570> it's

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
then flinging it into something it's

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.050 
then flinging it into something it's
just<00:05:04.200> really<00:05:04.409> cool

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
and I really like the one when you drop

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.140 
and I really like the one when you drop
down<00:05:06.620> from<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.160> air<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.370> smash<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.910> ground

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150

swinging areas and overall it just

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.570 
swinging areas and overall it just
needed<00:05:58.610> more<00:05:58.820> polish<00:05:59.270> but<00:06:00.050> to<00:06:00.800> be<00:06:00.979> honest<00:06:01.400> if
