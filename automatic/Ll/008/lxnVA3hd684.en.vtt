there

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.979 

I<00:02:24.590> think<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.680> go<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.069> step<00:02:26.480> forward<00:02:27.480> one<00:02:27.840> step

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
I think we go one step forward one step

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:28.729 
I think we go one step forward one step
higher

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
higher

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.440 
higher
by<00:02:29.099> doing<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.640> partnership<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
by doing this partnership with the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.869 
by doing this partnership with the
Dallas<00:02:30.810> Cowboys<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.549> number

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
Dallas Cowboys because it is the number

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.990 
Dallas Cowboys because it is the number
one<00:02:32.909> team<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.230> US<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> course<00:02:35.280> at<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
one team in the US and of course at the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.990 
one team in the US and of course at the
end<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.750> idea<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.560> go<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.340> destruction<00:02:38.730> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
end the idea is to go in destruction I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.309 
end the idea is to go in destruction I
think<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.299> potential<00:02:39.599> for<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.959> brand<00:02:40.200> new

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
think the potential for the brand new

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.130 
think the potential for the brand new
role<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.370> grow<00:02:41.519> by<00:02:41.700> 50%<00:02:41.879> in<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.959> next

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
role is we to grow by 50% in the next

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.829 
role is we to grow by 50% in the next
career
