all<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.080> other<00:01:42.220> YouTube<00:01:43.220> videos<00:01:43.250> are<00:01:43.820> people

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
all the other YouTube videos are people

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.630 
all the other YouTube videos are people

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
with different coordinates and after

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.100 
with different coordinates and after
flowing<00:01:46.910> over<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.450> caves<00:01:47.690> there's

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110
