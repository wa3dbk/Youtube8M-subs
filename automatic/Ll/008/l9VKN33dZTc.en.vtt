00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.990
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.700
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.559
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.090
 Solmecke and some time ago we had 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.630
 here ever reported that 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:23.140
 In the future djs will pay licenses to the gema 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.580
 When you want your music in the club 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.510
 bring along and to the club computer 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.820
 outplay 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.100
 we shall now take a closer look 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.410
 illuminate because there are more 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.540
 insights and in that respect I want 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.470
 explain to you briefly what is it about 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:43.210
 really so it should be paid money 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.870
 and that is 12 cents per copy if 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.250
 a dj copied a song for example 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.309
 copied to its hard drive 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.769
 how can that be the dj could become 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.690
 I think there are tons of cds here 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.790
 and I would like to join the discotheque 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.299
 take it to hang up there he takes 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.909
 20 cds with say ten songs are 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.369
 the 200 neither would he have twelve cents 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.100
 to the gema pay when he cds these up 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.740
 his mac book for such plays as 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.660
 he 200 songs on the macbook 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.360
 copied and then he has to now 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.160
 He normally pays 20 euros 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.810
 but not only 200 songs with but 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.090
 2000 liters will be more expensive then 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 costs about 200 euros there 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.040
 license fees are to be paid and now 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.860
 the clou comes when the dj is this 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.260
 songs from his cd on the computer 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.700
 pull and from there into the dropbox to 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.950
 for example, then return to the disco 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.960
 then the copy is from the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 computer into the dropbox another 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.340
 copy because now is the whole year in 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.760
 the cloud then cost this 2000 again 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.230
 already 200 euros 2002 copies 400 euros plus 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.820
 He retires to the disco 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.330
 on another computer again 200 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.640
 Euro 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.380
 because if 600 euros to the gema 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.190
 due that can be very very fast 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.750
 expensive 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.210
 It used to be like the clubs 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.460
 have to pay duty, the clubs have in 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.010
 Remainder even now a levy 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.820
 pay for the public performance 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.039
 the music that is strictly from the copy too 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.810
 disconnect and now it actually comes 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.909
 you can always be crazy 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.060
 still imagine that that applies to cds 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.790
 This also applies to online purchases 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.819
 music that is, the dj has the entire 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.349
 bought music from itunes 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.420
 And has he got this music on his 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.139
 hard disk downloaded 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.420
 then he can use this laptop in the 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.459
 to take a nightclub 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.280
 it becomes problematic when he hears the music 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.549
 on a different laptop dubbed then 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.840
 he has to pay for it again unless 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.090
 and so can german laws be 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 He clears the music on the output 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.500
 computer with only a single copy 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.810
 is available that would be possible 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.090
 So my tip to all djs if one 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.159
 collection of 20,000 itunes leader in 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.530
 you on the hard drive on the 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.209
 desktop pc for my sake but of course 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.400
 laptop with the disco next to want 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.060
 then and you want to be lawful 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.189
 behavior 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.989
 then take 1000 songs with or 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.359
 because of me 10,000 clears but again 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.870
 exactly these 10,000 liters from the origin 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.189
 calculator 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.989
 then you can march the disco 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.879
 Do you come home from the disco? 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.859
 you can do it all back 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.599
 copy and then have to open again 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.889
 I can delete the test on the laptop 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.719
 myself with each other where you 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.370
 now delete here copy may but so 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.099
 crazy is this new regulation the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.199
 since the beginning of april the djs is valid 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.060
 must be considered accordingly that is 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.609
 no april joke I'm curious how 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.109
 the gema wants to keep the whole 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.459
 because it is of course not so 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.290
 easy to know who has this here now 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.569
 bought at itunes on which calculator 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.769
 that would be bought by manager would 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.290
 I always say yes why that is 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.639
 also the calculator with itunes where I am 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.290
 that download me 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.569
 so that will be many more 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.569
 Generate follow-up questions here and I am 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.009
 curious what the whole thing still trigger 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.019
 We will of course here is 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.970

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.419
