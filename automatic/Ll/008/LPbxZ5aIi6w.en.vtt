refrigerated<00:00:22.800> crescent<00:00:23.400> roll<00:00:23.519> dough<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.060> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
refrigerated crescent roll dough this is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
refrigerated crescent roll dough this is
the<00:00:24.330> butter<00:00:24.510> flake<00:00:24.840> variety<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.800> then<00:00:25.890> we're

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the butter flake variety and then we're

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.130 
the butter flake variety and then we're
gonna<00:00:26.070> unroll<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
gonna unroll it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.510 
gonna unroll it
there's<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> seam<00:00:30.890> right<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.219> you'll<00:00:32.340> see

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
there's the seam right and you'll see

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.360 
there's the seam right and you'll see
there<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:33.000> eight<00:00:33.840> triangles<00:00:34.230> we're<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
there are eight triangles we're going to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.920 
there are eight triangles we're going to
cut<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:35.640> eight<00:00:35.850> triangles<00:00:36.120> into<00:00:36.480> skinnier

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
cut these eight triangles into skinnier

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.770 
cut these eight triangles into skinnier
triangles<00:00:37.879> now<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.090> an<00:00:39.210> important<00:00:39.660> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
triangles now it's an important that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
triangles now it's an important that
they<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:39.989> isosceles<00:00:40.860> triangle<00:00:41.790> variant

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
they be isosceles triangle variant

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.819 
they be isosceles triangle variant
that's<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.750> crucial<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.410> about<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that's the crucial thing about this

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.670 
that's the crucial thing about this
recipe<00:00:44.070> yes<00:00:44.520> you've<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.300> got<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
recipe yes you've got you got it and the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.069 
recipe yes you've got you got it and the
easiest<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> cut<00:00:47.550> these<00:00:47.730> triangles<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
easiest way to cut these triangles is to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.069 
easiest way to cut these triangles is to
start<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.670> point<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.899> cut

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
start from this point up here and cut

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.670 
start from this point up here and cut
that<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> filling<00:00:53.160> has<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.969> nice

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
that way now the filling has some nice

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
that way now the filling has some nice
Asian<00:00:55.680> type<00:00:56.280> flavors<00:00:56.879> we've<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.690> cream

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this is not time-consuming at all it's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.950 
this is not time-consuming at all it's
kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.560> fun<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.329> think<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.899> I
