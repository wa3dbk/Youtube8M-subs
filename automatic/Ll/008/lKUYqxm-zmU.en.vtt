00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 Have you ever imagined working at home? 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.370
 in the greatest comfort doing the same 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.830
 office tasks for some 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 companies and professionals the lucky ones 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.660
 teleworking is already a reality 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 It's okay that there are those who like the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 working in an office is not always the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 best of all worlds is also the stress already 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 starts on the road to work in traffic 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 and if you are late because of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.590
 congestion is still 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.750
 Boss can be said that a lot of people 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.670
 sacrifice the lunch to solve 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 personal problems and when I get 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 It 's time to sleep for 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.960
 face it all again in the day 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.850
 Following 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.860
 so some bosses discovered that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.320
 this routine does not do well or pro 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.480
 employee and company and began to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.690
 adopt another type of relationship let's say 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 more flexible is the case of joselma when 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 she is tired can smoothly gives 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 one stretched out in the armchair a relaxed one 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.559
 with the husband, because that's the facade 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 the place of work of the household and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.589
 she is an employee of a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 government company trying to find everything 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070
 there 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.510
 The difference is that it is a screen and 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.979
 worker contact with the boss himself 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.409
 just over the internet 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.200
 Okay, a dream, you 're going to think it 's a cinch. 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.420
 will I have to produce at least the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 even if it produced the company's account 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 the ideal is that it produces more but if you 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.869
 suddenly lives in an apartment not 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.060
 very large does not have a space 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.920
 specific to an office does not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 problem not to work at home in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.159
 most cases only have one corner in the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.549
 room anyway 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.159
 the bed side is more than adequate 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.710
 to do exactly the same service 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.579
 that there be company here in the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.890
 comfort of the home 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.920
 now I can take my daughters in 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
 school, I already have the bag for my husband 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.070
 Today I managed to make a gym without 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 to be very tired 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.720
 so four years ago the company already here 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.939
 saved three and a half million reais 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 with all the employees who went through 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.560
 work at home and it is best that 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.090
 foreign sales grew 40% 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.799
 of course there are cases where this does not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.420
 how the worker would ride 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.960
 a car at home does not have 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.729
 as right 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.039
 but the market already seems to start 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.910
 understand that when the circumstances 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.860
 allow a game there 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.900
 everyone understood that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.660
 no matter the individual is just there 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.940
 it has to be productive and within 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.200
 the possibilities of technology 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.140
 that we have today 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.820
 where he is if he wants to. 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.820
 want it can be productive
