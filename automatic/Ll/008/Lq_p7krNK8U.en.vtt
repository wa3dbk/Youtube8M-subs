00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
so Steve we see a solar panel in the

middle of a soybean field this is a
picture<00:00:07.230> that's<00:00:07.379> becoming<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.799> guess<00:00:08.189> more<00:00:08.460> and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639

focus on we looked at the numbers coming

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.330 
focus on we looked at the numbers coming
out<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.019> what<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.230> denounced<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> decided

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
out of what they denounced and decided

that<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> business<00:00:33.059> decision<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.960> was

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that as a business decision it was

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.750 
that as a business decision it was
somewhat<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> no-brainer<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.640> we're<00:00:37.760> okay

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
somewhat of a no-brainer so we're okay

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.540 
somewhat of a no-brainer so we're okay
so<00:00:38.820> what<00:00:39.059> did<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.270> panel<00:00:39.750> powering<00:00:40.680> right

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so what did this panel powering right

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
so what did this panel powering right
now<00:00:41.730> we've<00:00:42.570> got<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.989> set<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.710> strictly

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
now we've got it set up to go strictly

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
now we've got it set up to go strictly
into<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> electrical<00:00:45.000> grid<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.480> not<00:00:45.600> using

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
into the electrical grid we're not using

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
into the electrical grid we're not using
it<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> offset<00:00:47.329> physically<00:00:48.329> any<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> power

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it to offset physically any of the power

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.229 
it to offset physically any of the power
that<00:00:50.039> we're<00:00:50.160> using<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.489> run<00:00:50.579> our<00:00:50.760> fans<00:00:51.000> or

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that we're using to run our fans or

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
that we're using to run our fans or
Asian<00:00:51.510> fans<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.989> our<00:00:52.079> lights<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.829> sort<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Asian fans or our lights or that sort of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
Asian fans or our lights or that sort of
thing<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.520> strictly<00:00:54.079> to<00:00:55.079> keep<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
thing it's just strictly to keep it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.880 
thing it's just strictly to keep it
simple<00:00:55.680> setup<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.129> an<00:00:56.250> investment<00:00:56.640> okay<00:00:57.500> but<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
simple setup as an investment okay but I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.060 
simple setup as an investment okay but I
guess<00:00:59.280> do<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.539> putting<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:01.530> solar

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
guess do you see putting more solar

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
guess do you see putting more solar
panels<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.579> farm<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> maybe

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
panels on your farm to maybe

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.870 
panels on your farm to maybe
power<00:01:04.170> things<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.280> shop<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.760> your

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
power things like your shop or your

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.500 
power things like your shop or your
office<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:07.049> house<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> look<00:01:09.299> at

has<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.570> been<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.930> controversial<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
has it been so controversial I think the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
has it been so controversial I think the
biggest<00:01:50.729> challenge<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.780> original

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
biggest challenge was the original

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
biggest challenge was the original

weekend<00:02:05.400> which<00:02:05.580> was<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.760> little<00:02:05.880> sly<00:02:06.300> on<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
weekend which was a little sly on the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.109 
weekend which was a little sly on the
part<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:06.990> decision-makers<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.950> drop<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
part of decision-makers to drop it to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.730

eight<00:02:10.860> cents<00:02:11.160> per<00:02:11.310> kilowatt-hour<00:02:11.730> which

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
eight cents per kilowatt-hour which

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.060 
eight cents per kilowatt-hour which
drastically<00:02:12.900> changed<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> ground<00:02:13.830> rules

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
drastically changed the ground rules

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.650 
drastically changed the ground rules
especially<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:14.850> they<00:02:14.940> denounced<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
especially when they denounced that the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.920 
especially when they denounced that the
original<00:02:16.050> review<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> happen

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
original review was not going to happen

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
original review was not going to happen
so<00:02:18.930> they<00:02:19.050> dropped<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.410> from<00:02:19.560> eighty<00:02:20.190> four

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so they dropped it from eighty four

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.600 
so they dropped it from eighty four
cents<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> 50s<00:02:22.560> eighty<00:02:23.040> point<00:02:23.400> two

cents to in the 50s eighty point two
cents<00:02:24.030> fifty<00:02:24.750> point<00:02:24.990> eight<00:02:25.110> cents<00:02:25.530> that's<00:02:25.890> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
cents fifty point eight cents that's a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.710 
cents fifty point eight cents that's a
dramatic<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> lot<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.090> guys<00:02:27.270> had<00:02:27.450> made<00:02:27.570> an

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
dramatic so a lot of guys had made an

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.290 
dramatic so a lot of guys had made an
investment<00:02:28.110> based<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.830> eighty<00:02:29.610> cents<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
investment based on that eighty cents I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.470 
investment based on that eighty cents I
think<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:32.010> know<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.700> guess<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.330> could

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
think so and you know I guess you could

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.660 
think so and you know I guess you could
question<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.140> business<00:02:35.010> decision<00:02:35.520> of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
question the business decision of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.790 
question the business decision of
participants<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.660> put<00:02:37.410> their<00:02:37.530> money<00:02:37.680> down

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
participants to put their money down

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.710 
participants to put their money down
before<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.370> had<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.520> contract<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.180> place<00:02:39.240> when

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
before they had a contract in place when

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.800 
before they had a contract in place when
everything<00:02:40.050> seemed<00:02:40.820> barely<00:02:41.820> lucrative<00:02:42.660> if

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
everything seemed barely lucrative if

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.090 
everything seemed barely lucrative if
that's<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.200> word<00:02:43.380> or<00:02:43.650> fairly<00:02:44.310> sound<00:02:46.100> involved

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
that's the word or fairly sound involved

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.400 
that's the word or fairly sound involved
but<00:02:47.570> fortune<00:02:48.570> know<00:02:48.660> who<00:02:48.780> are<00:02:48.930> early<00:02:49.140> enough

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
but fortune know who are early enough

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.470 
but fortune know who are early enough
that<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.740> beat<00:02:49.920> any<00:02:50.040> changes<00:02:50.550> now<00:02:50.790> subsequent

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that we beat any changes now subsequent

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.150 
that we beat any changes now subsequent
to<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.050> government<00:02:52.080> has<00:02:52.650> realized<00:02:52.950> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
to that the government has realized it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.310 
to that the government has realized it
eventually<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:54.030> announced<00:02:54.960> they<00:02:55.110> will<00:02:55.260> be

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
eventually and announced they will be

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.050 
eventually and announced they will be
honoring<00:02:55.800> all<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.130> applications<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.850> were

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
honoring all the applications that were

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.710 
honoring all the applications that were
sent<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.530> off<00:02:58.530> until<00:02:58.800> July<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.100> second<00:02:59.550> but<00:03:00.480> my

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
sent in off until July the second but my

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.820 
sent in off until July the second but my
understanding<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.410> somewhat

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
understanding is that a somewhat

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.530 
understanding is that a somewhat
somewhat<00:03:02.370> lower<00:03:02.520> rate<00:03:02.760> sixty-four<00:03:03.300> cents

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
somewhat lower rate sixty-four cents

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.650 
somewhat lower rate sixty-four cents
change<00:03:04.170> okay<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.459> think<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:06.030> this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
change okay so do you think that this

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.699 
change okay so do you think that this
kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> program<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.350> going<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.500> increase

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
kind of program is going to increase

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.500 
kind of program is going to increase
more<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.160> more<00:03:08.280> our<00:03:08.700> farmers<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.209> guess<00:03:09.360> in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
more and more our farmers I guess in

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.180 
more and more our farmers I guess in
general<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.470> people<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.890> farmers

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
general from the the people the farmers

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.740 
general from the the people the farmers
that<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.459> hang<00:03:11.730> out<00:03:11.820> with<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.180> talk<00:03:12.390> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that you hang out with and talk to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
that you hang out with and talk to
is<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.770> lot<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.950> interest<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.459> solar

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
is there a lot of interest in solar

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.000 
is there a lot of interest in solar
energy<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.270> think<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.110> interest<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.560> there<00:03:16.590> but

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
energy I think the interest is there but

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.010 
energy I think the interest is there but
the<00:03:17.100> bottom<00:03:17.430> line<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:18.239> it's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> business

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
the bottom line is it's it's a business

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.510 
the bottom line is it's it's a business
decision<00:03:19.320> it's<00:03:19.770> an<00:03:19.860> economic<00:03:20.370> decision

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
decision it's an economic decision

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.960 
decision it's an economic decision
obviously<00:03:21.360> some<00:03:21.840> people<00:03:21.959> will<00:03:22.260> have<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.680> an

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
obviously some people will have it as an

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.150 
obviously some people will have it as an
emotional<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.239> lifestyle<00:03:25.230> decision<00:03:25.770> but<00:03:26.070> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
emotional or lifestyle decision but I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.370 
emotional or lifestyle decision but I
look<00:03:26.580> at<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.910> as<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> business<00:03:27.510> decision<00:03:27.840> I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
look at it as a business decision I

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.690 
look at it as a business decision I
think<00:03:28.709> there<00:03:28.950> should<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.130> interest<00:03:29.489> out<00:03:29.670> there

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
think there should be interest out there

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.780 
think there should be interest out there
by<00:03:30.239> producers<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.989> think<00:03:31.290> even<00:03:32.010> at<00:03:32.100> sixty<00:03:32.459> four

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
by producers I think even at sixty four

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.850 
by producers I think even at sixty four
point<00:03:33.060> two<00:03:33.209> cents<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.840> makes<00:03:34.050> sense<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:34.680> up

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
point two cents it makes sense to put up
