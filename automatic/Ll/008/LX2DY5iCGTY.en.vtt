00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 after the first contact with 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.300
 new recruits it's very important 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.100
 I try to reassure them and their 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.400
 show that they can count on me 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.090

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.700
 it's very important as we say it's 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.830
 the base when there is no training 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 I push myself as the stone says 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 take a workstation compared 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 This is where I see if there are 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.920
 buddies to fix and if there is anyone 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.300
 who needs both I raise a good 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.220
 trainer is someone who knows 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.290
 theses of the trainers was an opportunity 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.390
