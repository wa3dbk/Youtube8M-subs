part of the coronary artery the balloon

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.030 
part of the coronary artery the balloon
is<00:02:56.099> briefly<00:02:56.519> inflated<00:02:56.819> as<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:58.170> expands<00:02:58.829> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
is briefly inflated as it expands it

is briefly inflated as it expands it
squeezes<00:02:59.549> the<00:03:00.299> plaque<00:03:00.329> deposits<00:03:00.870> against<00:03:01.530> the

squeezes the plaque deposits against the
wall<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.069> artery<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:04.470> also<00:03:04.739> stretches<00:03:05.250> the

artery wall and enlarges the channel

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.819 
artery wall and enlarges the channel
through<00:03:08.010> which<00:03:08.040> blood<00:03:08.459> flows<00:03:09.380> your<00:03:10.380> doctor

will continue to inflate and deflate the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.500 
will continue to inflate and deflate the
balloon<00:03:13.500> until<00:03:13.829> normal<00:03:14.310> blood<00:03:14.760> flow<00:03:15.030> has<00:03:15.480> been
