00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
we should have checked see how hard this

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.100 
we should have checked see how hard this
girl<00:02:16.670> was<00:02:16.940> before<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.299> tried<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.659> this<00:02:20.110> you

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
girl was before I tried to do this you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.800 
girl was before I tried to do this you
slide<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.620> through<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.480> take<00:02:23.659> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
slide that through and then you take the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.259 
slide that through and then you take the
two<00:02:23.989> bits<00:02:24.200> here<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.830> what<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.730> did<00:02:25.940> ahead<00:02:26.180> of

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
two bits here and what I did ahead of

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.149 
two bits here and what I did ahead of
time<00:02:26.450> because<00:02:26.629> I<00:02:26.959> always<00:02:27.230> take<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:27.799> cable

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
time because I always take that or cable

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.820 
time because I always take that or cable
off<00:02:28.310> when<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.150> working<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.660> car<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.170> you

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
off when I'm working on the car is you

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.680 
off when I'm working on the car is you
then<00:02:31.040> need<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.280> hook<00:02:32.830> your<00:02:34.209> negative<00:02:35.209> cable<00:02:35.599> up

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
then need to hook your negative cable up

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.100 
then need to hook your negative cable up
to<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.930> negative<00:02:36.290> terminal<00:02:40.959> mind<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:42.079> I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
to the negative terminal mind you I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.600 
to the negative terminal mind you I
still<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.560> entire<00:02:42.769> system<00:02:43.190> disconnect

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
still have the entire system disconnect

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.569 
still have the entire system disconnect
from<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.940> battery<00:02:44.680> then<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.829> need<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.250> hook

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
from the battery then you need to hook

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.479 
from the battery then you need to hook
your<00:02:48.400> positive<00:02:49.400> cable<00:02:49.790> up<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.799> her<00:02:51.799> positive

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
your positive cable up and her positive

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.420 
your positive cable up and her positive
terminal<00:02:53.209> gets<00:02:53.480> way<00:02:54.379> corroded<00:02:55.040> there<00:02:55.250> what

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
terminal gets way corroded there what

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.059 
terminal gets way corroded there what
forget<00:02:55.760> wipers<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.750> bad<00:02:57.019> because<00:02:57.950> it

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
forget wipers is so bad because it

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.520 
forget wipers is so bad because it
doesn't<00:02:58.280> have<00:02:58.370> any<00:02:58.400> drains<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:58.970> it<00:02:59.530> but

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
doesn't have any drains in it but

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.809 
doesn't have any drains in it but
basically<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.190> get<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.370> two<00:03:01.579> of<00:03:01.609> these

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
basically you get the two of these

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.319 
basically you get the two of these
hooked<00:03:02.120> up<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:03.190> then<00:03:04.190> what<00:03:04.609> this<00:03:04.760> allows<00:03:05.060> you

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
hooked up and then what this allows you

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.759 
hooked up and then what this allows you
to<00:03:05.359> do<00:03:05.690> is<00:03:06.290> once<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.129> get<00:03:07.220> your<00:03:07.400> batteries

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
to do is once you get your batteries

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.559 
to do is once you get your batteries
once<00:03:09.769> your<00:03:09.890> battery<00:03:10.280> cables<00:03:10.400> back<00:03:10.819> on<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.420> the

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
once your battery cables back on and the

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.750 
once your battery cables back on and the
bolts<00:03:11.810> tightened<00:03:12.170> up<00:03:12.290> it's<00:03:13.040> for<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.519> on

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
bolts tightened up it's for that on

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.640 
bolts tightened up it's for that on
you'll<00:03:14.720> actually<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.230> able<00:03:15.379> to<00:03:15.620> access<00:03:15.829> your

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
you'll actually be able to access your

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.900 
you'll actually be able to access your
battery<00:03:18.650> tender<00:03:18.950> from<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.750> parcel<00:03:21.109> shelf<00:03:21.910> and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
battery tender from the parcel shelf and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.240 
battery tender from the parcel shelf and
I<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.150> actually<00:03:23.299> put<00:03:23.599> my<00:03:23.690> hand<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.380> table

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
I can actually put my hand on the table

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.759 
I can actually put my hand on the table
right<00:03:25.430> now<00:03:25.639> so<00:03:26.510> what<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:26.780> means<00:03:27.079> is<00:03:27.410> when<00:03:27.739> you

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
right now so what that means is when you

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.240 
right now so what that means is when you
go<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.069> touch<00:03:28.880> car<00:03:29.209> away<00:03:29.389> for<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.660> while<00:03:30.250> plug

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
go to touch car away for a while plug

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.920 
go to touch car away for a while plug
