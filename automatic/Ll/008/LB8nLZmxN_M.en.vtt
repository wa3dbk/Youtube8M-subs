I mean adaptation yes as you know camels
live<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.820> hot<00:02:40.330> desert<00:02:40.959> where<00:02:41.350> sand<00:02:41.739> blows

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
live in hot desert where sand blows

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.740 
live in hot desert where sand blows
everywhere<00:02:43.320> camels<00:02:44.320> have<00:02:44.709> double<00:02:45.280> rows<00:02:45.580> of

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
everywhere camels have double rows of

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.920 
everywhere camels have double rows of
extra<00:02:46.750> long<00:02:46.959> lashes<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.860> pick<00:02:48.520> eyebrows<00:02:49.270> to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
extra long lashes and pick eyebrows to

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.280 
extra long lashes and pick eyebrows to
keep<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.410> sand<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.520> their<00:02:51.700> eyes<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.420> as

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
keep the sand out of their eyes and as

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.070 
keep the sand out of their eyes and as
you<00:02:53.560> know<00:02:53.709> there<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.310> very<00:02:54.790> less<00:02:55.239> vegetation

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
you know there is very less vegetation

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.870 
you know there is very less vegetation
and<00:02:56.290> water<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.400> desert

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
and water in the desert

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.960 
and water in the desert
so<00:02:58.420> candles<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.530> work<00:02:59.769> for<00:03:00.100> many<00:03:00.550> days

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
so candles have to work for many days

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.290 
so candles have to work for many days
without<00:03:01.360> food<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.260> water<00:03:02.769> they<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.970> big

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
without food and water they have big

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.699

this fat can be converted as a source of

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.220 
this fat can be converted as a source of
energy<00:03:11.530> when<00:03:12.400> food<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.090> water<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.930> not
