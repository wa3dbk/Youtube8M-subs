inside of the flight for the PT 2 it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
inside of the flight for the PT 2 it's
pretty<00:01:36.180> cool<00:01:36.299> has<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> padding<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.049> top<00:01:37.110> it's

pretty cool has the padding on top it's
a<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.250> good<00:01:38.400> flat<00:01:38.610> case<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.000> could

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
a really good flat case you could

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
a really good flat case you could
probably<00:01:39.270> chunk<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.049> some<00:01:40.350> stairs<00:01:40.530> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
probably chunk it down some stairs if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.859 
probably chunk it down some stairs if
wouldn't<00:01:40.950> hurt<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.189> at<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.780> there's<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
wouldn't hurt it at all there's the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
bottom of it let me put the pedal board

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.800 
bottom of it let me put the pedal board
in<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> pedals<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
in there with the pedals on it so you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.999 
in there with the pedals on it so you
can<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.049> what<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.200> looks<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.470> okay<00:01:46.860> here's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the flight case with the pedal board

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
the flight case with the pedal board
inside<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.860> cool<00:01:50.009> cuz<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
inside of it it's really cool cuz the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.370 
inside of it it's really cool cuz the
bomb<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.759> top<00:01:50.970> comes<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.049> push<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> on

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
bomb the top comes down and push it on

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
bomb the top comes down and push it on
the<00:01:52.470> pedal<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.159> move<00:01:53.340> around<00:01:53.610> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the pedal so that don't move around I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.389 
the pedal so that don't move around I
find<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> bottom<00:01:54.720> row<00:01:55.079> still<00:01:55.740> isn't<00:01:56.280> quite

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
find at the bottom row still isn't quite

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
find at the bottom row still isn't quite
tight<00:01:56.610> enough<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:58.079> somewhere

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
tight enough so if I'm going somewhere

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.950 
tight enough so if I'm going somewhere
our<00:01:58.950> thoughts<00:01:59.939> how<00:02:00.149> long<00:02:00.360> they're<00:02:00.540> something

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
our thoughts how long they're something

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
our thoughts how long they're something
just<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> keep<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.710> keep<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.700> place<00:02:02.969> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
just to keep and keep it in place and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
just to keep and keep it in place and
give<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.689> padding<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.799> let's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
give it a little more padding so let's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.130 
give it a little more padding so let's
take<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> look<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> gig<00:02:05.850> bag<00:02:06.000> here's<00:02:06.930> the
