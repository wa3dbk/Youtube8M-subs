00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.770
 to my father 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.950
 of this misfortune the creature of yours what 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.360

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:32.300
 Before you I introduce myself I open my heart 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.150

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.050
 penetrate the nothing I say I offer myself 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.950
 I sacrifice I abandon myself to the designs 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.690
 that in relation to me you have formed not 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.120
 I should have more wishes to fulfill 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.220
 with your holy will or my Jesus 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.580

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.680

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.620
 let it be further away from you 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 Holy holy holy service is the Lord 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.220
 god of the full armies are the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.370
 heavens and the land of your glory 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.420
 and in the midst of so much greatness you will hear 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:27.100
 my requests that you are my god because 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.310
 by calling you god father god son and god 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 holy spirit I put in you all my 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.760
 trust and my faith and I hope the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.840
 fulfillment of your word 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.840
 today I said 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.620
 Holy, the plague will not teach me 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.130
 I breathe the nakedness the misery the hunger 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.950
 The lightning will not reach my doors 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.650
 the hurricane will fall on my head 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.680
 trembling the spark and the fire 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.670
 will respect and my enemies will tremble in 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.170
 my presence will see in me the help 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.229
 divine glory to the father glory to the son and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.769
 glory to the holy spirit 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.200
 as it was in the beginning now and always 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.980
 forever and ever 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.980
 Amen
