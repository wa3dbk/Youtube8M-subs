00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.190
 nice golden armor and also a helmet 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.380
 to admire this is who also counts 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.890
 with a layer that unfortunately does not 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.170
 move with movement or with the wind 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.250

 magician that as you can see has a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.120
 singular layer and also a face some 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.460
 expressive 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 this corner is based on an enemy 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.390
 of a game called heretical 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.040
 [Music] 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.930
 put in the position number 8 we find 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.270
 to this singular friend that how can 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.780
 see is a yeti is naked by the way 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.760
 there it moves and is supposed to move 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 it has some movement in the mouth it does not 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.850
 judge in my opinion or gray 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.439

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.680

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.960
 saved from that explosion it 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 find our friend born in Syria 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.849

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.370
 kings that is located in the position number 7 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.069
 if you like this script and like it 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.620
 position number 6 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.689
 at number six and most effeminate 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.519
 that never reaches the link of the legend of 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.500
 zelda if you do not know it well you have 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.129
 lost much of the history of the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.829
 video game 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.950
 here as you can see is the link with the 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.739
 audio is painted pink and very feminine 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.560
 in fact there he brings his normal clothes and 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.380
 rest is the one that is located in the post 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.590
 number 6 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.080
 position number 5 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.480
 in position number 5 a clone is located 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.150
 of star wars as you can see is very 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.879
 well done the skin and if you ask 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.180
 where am I in a hangar here of 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:03.299
 ships of a map that downloads star wars 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.640
 I can not go down because in fact it jumps a 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.340
 little and I kill myself and here in fact I have my 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.340
 Radar 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.280
 to remove it and how can you see the fall 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.040
 it's something big in jump and it's made of 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.700
 clone porridge in short this is the skin 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.290
 which is located at number 5 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 [Music] 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.150
 put the number 4 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.140
 in position number 4 is located batman and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.870
 As you can see, he's here in a meeting 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.210
 family that's why there are so many bats 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.300
 to change 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.880
 in order here there is a gentleman but there are other 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.530
 but we're not going to mess with this 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.940
 corner is very well made indeed 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.090
 it has a layer behind but at 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.670
 movement because it does not move like that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.500
 with the air does not move in a way 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.870
 normal also ahead is very good 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.819
 made the mask the shield and everything is 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.080
 very well done in these who who 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.110
 located at number 4 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.020
 put the number 3 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.360
 [Music] 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.210
 in position number 3 the skin is located 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.490
 Ironman as you can see is very well 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.300
 done the details are fine 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:21.030
 defined perhaps a little bit the part of the 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.400
 center not so much but good anyway 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.620
 others is too well done and 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.870
 I recognize the work that made 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.430
 the corner was very well done for what 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.430
 place number 2 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.070
 do not 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.530
 [Music] 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.990
 Well, there's still a lot of work left in the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.139
 position number 2 is this skin 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.979
 that I really do not know what is going on as it is 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.469
 without clothes he has a very interesting beard 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.020
 And besides, to me it seems to me 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:05.169
 a lumberjack because so much you 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.419
 can put comparison have armor 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.210
 a little inefficient that does not cover everything 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:14.490
 the body but there he is in the post 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.490
 number 2 curiously 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.419
 number one 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:35.139
 [Music] 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.780
 at number 1 here under the 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.910
 rain is a skin based on 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.890
 alsace written the truth I do not know in what 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.590
 character is based but is 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.380
 obviously modified with diamonds here 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:59.080
 back has an ax and is the one that 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.080
 located at number 1 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.630
 in the bonus section here we find 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.610
 a skin that called me a lot the 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.849
 attention for the colors that it handles that 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.970
 almost give cindy a tone as I know to 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:20.490
 I seem the ones as you see it is 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.740
 a corner also very well worked and 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:26.440
 it caught my attention and that's why 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.390
 I put in the bowling section 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.610
