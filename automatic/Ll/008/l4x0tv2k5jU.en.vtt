00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
just the economy I'd find cardboard

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
just the economy I'd find cardboard
boxes<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.909> cut<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.569> and<00:01:03.749> make<00:01:03.899> pieces

with<00:01:04.440> him<00:01:04.620> I<00:01:04.710> could<00:01:04.890> paint<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:07.410> work<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
with him I could paint on it the work is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
with him I could paint on it the work is
very<00:01:07.890> physical<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> there's<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.850> escape<00:01:09.180> in

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
very physical and there's an escape in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
very physical and there's an escape in
that<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> takes<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.710> its<00:01:11.040> own<00:01:11.220> life<00:01:11.460> as

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that and it takes on its own life as

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.390 
that and it takes on its own life as
well<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.870> very<00:01:12.990> abstract<00:01:13.440> in<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.070> beginning

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
well it's very abstract in the beginning

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.960 
well it's very abstract in the beginning
as<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.780> starts<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.260> if<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:17.070> pieces<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.730> cut

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
as it starts to if all pieces are cut

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.280 
as it starts to if all pieces are cut
away<00:01:18.000> pieces<00:01:18.750> are<00:01:19.020> added<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
away pieces are added on and I think the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
away pieces are added on and I think the
hard<00:01:22.500> part<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.800> knowing<00:01:23.010> when<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:23.400> stop<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
hard part is knowing when to stop to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.380 
hard part is knowing when to stop to
leave<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.870> sense<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.320> vitality<00:01:26.390> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
leave it with a sense of vitality it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.920 
leave it with a sense of vitality it's
pretty<00:01:28.050> simplistic<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.280> very<00:01:29.430> low-tech

immortality the materials suggest that

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.810 
immortality the materials suggest that
the<00:01:58.380> way<00:01:58.590> they're<00:01:58.800> put<00:01:59.070> together<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> very
