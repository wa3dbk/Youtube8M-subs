00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
overall tactical look so go and get into

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.660 
overall tactical look so go and get into
specifications<00:03:17.349> in<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.620> because<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.099> is<00:03:18.220> it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
specifications in this because it is it

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.979 
specifications in this because it is it
is<00:03:18.790> going<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.030> differ<00:03:19.180> from<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.569> traditional

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
is going to differ from the traditional

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.650 
is going to differ from the traditional
delica<00:03:20.380> for<00:03:20.620> their<00:03:21.280> overall<00:03:21.880> length<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.359> six

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
delica for their overall length is six

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.900 
delica for their overall length is six
point<00:03:22.930> seven<00:03:23.139> inches<00:03:23.590> long<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.609> it's<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.730> little

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
point seven inches long so it's a little

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.430 
point seven inches long so it's a little
lower<00:03:25.030> than<00:03:25.209> delica<00:03:25.599> for<00:03:25.840> now<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.169> blood

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
lower than delica for now the blood

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.250 
lower than delica for now the blood
length<00:03:26.709> on<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.190> 2.5<00:03:27.880> inches<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.079> is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
length on this is 2.5 inches so that is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.909 
length on this is 2.5 inches so that is
a<00:03:29.489> more<00:03:30.489> legal<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:30.940> carry<00:03:31.180> most<00:03:31.810> places<00:03:32.169> than

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
a more legal to carry most places than

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.680 
a more legal to carry most places than
the<00:03:33.099> traditional<00:03:33.639> delica<00:03:34.060> 4<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.389> with<00:03:34.540> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the traditional delica 4 is with that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.879 
the traditional delica 4 is with that
longer<00:03:34.930> length<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.410> believe<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.739> like<00:03:35.799> a

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
longer length I believe it's like a

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.620 
longer length I believe it's like a
three-inch<00:03:36.280> blade<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.209> fantastic

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
three-inch blade just a fantastic

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.750
