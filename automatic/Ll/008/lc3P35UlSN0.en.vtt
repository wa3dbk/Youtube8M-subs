I don't lose anything on the floor you
can<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:23.000> tons<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.150> hair<00:02:24.300> cable<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:28.020> if

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
can see tons of hair cable and then if

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.110 
can see tons of hair cable and then if
you<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:30.420> can

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
you want to you can

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120 
you want to you can
he'll<00:02:31.599> through<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.290> see<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.770> if<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.010> were

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
he'll through and see like if you were

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.680 
he'll through and see like if you were
trimming<00:02:33.550> because<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.090> split<00:02:34.300> ends<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
trimming because you have split ends you

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.670 
trimming because you have split ends you
can<00:02:34.810> normally<00:02:35.080> run<00:02:35.230> your<00:02:35.349> fingers<00:02:35.650> through

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
can normally run your fingers through

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.089 
can normally run your fingers through
and<00:02:36.040> see<00:02:36.190> whether<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.520> got<00:02:36.670> most<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.120> them<00:02:38.099> for

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
and see whether you got most of them for

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.440 
and see whether you got most of them for
the<00:02:39.160> first<00:02:39.370> couple<00:02:39.610> times<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.209> you're

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the first couple times that you're

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.630 
the first couple times that you're
trimming<00:02:41.140> until<00:02:41.620> your<00:02:41.739> hair<00:02:41.920> grows<00:02:42.190> out<00:02:42.340> more

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
trimming until your hair grows out more

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.890 
trimming until your hair grows out more
you<00:02:43.080> probably<00:02:44.080> won't<00:02:45.810> get<00:02:48.209> every<00:02:49.209> split<00:02:49.660> end

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
you probably won't get every split end

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.620 
you probably won't get every split end
and<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.380> won't<00:02:50.560> trim<00:02:50.860> every<00:02:51.190> single<00:02:51.519> end<00:02:51.700> but

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
and you won't trim every single end but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.690 
and you won't trim every single end but
over<00:02:52.870> time<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.800> should<00:02:54.099> get<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.430> point

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
over time it should get to the point

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.510 
over time it should get to the point
where<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.269> can
