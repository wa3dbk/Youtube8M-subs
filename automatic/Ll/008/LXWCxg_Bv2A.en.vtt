00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.609
 good evening dear friends with you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.740
 Viktor usi-pusi and today we lead our 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.360
 report from the zigfried line card where 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.700
 another friendly match is underway 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.190
 between the random team of greens and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 famous victorious random 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.090
 Red team today we will 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.090
 watch the game on behalf of the player under 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.310
 nickname gorgue 04 them and db 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.890
 yes friends for a long time this player played for 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 clan hdp but most recently legendary 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.990
 the random green team outbid him 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.570
 for a thousand gold coins and 10 premium 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 first-aid kits and so for the green play today 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 cake 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.910
 1978 Alaric 2 Eric Felix Spam Bow with 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.920
 Lars shorter many interesting personalities 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.820
 for the red play no less strong 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.129
 players are the famous xxx series 7 and xx 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.559
 x can also be distinguished in the red team 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.710
 such a star as Anton 65 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.300
 Aaaaa in ddd today he plays on tank 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 t-34 85 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.149
 now we see how our hero commits 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.060
 maneuver check in garage called t28 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.310
 but today is the location of the stars 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.770
 unfavorable and go inside 28 not 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.110
 turns in the meantime on the horizon 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 glow t32 and t-34 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 if you follow this logic as follows 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
 should be lit t 36 but the team 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.100
 the opponent commits a deceptive maneuver and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.229
 shows on the horizon t-150 how are you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.229
 see the gorg playing on the tank today 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.150
 panther is a very very famous tank 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.240
 My friends, he is famous above all those 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.159
 which was named in his honor from mammals 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.049
 the cat family at this time our 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.060
 the panther is about to leave for another 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.600
 card well at the time of throwing this stupid 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 occupation and meets t-34 85 the same 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 the crown of the Soviet tank in this 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.000
 time 28 in which our tried to call 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 the hero goes beautifully my friends and technically 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 merge into apparently literally 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.780
 in a second it will not be ours 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 panther goes to the mountain wants for 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.579
 Damaging Isa third but not pumped 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.340
 perk that allows you to lower the barrel 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.590
 lower than 35 degrees and if so 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 Perk is generally a mystery, we see how 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.700
 literally 30 meters from us exploded 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.750
 some 30 meters were separated 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 our hero from death but he miraculously survived 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.920
 tank commander shows the lamp is 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.410
 signal for the mechanical input to pass back 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.540
 Mechanic Drive hits concrete spikes 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.080
 He does this to correct with 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.420
 flying from epic caterpillar and all that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.819
 it remains for our hero to just wait 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.040
 wait for him to come out at the same time 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.709
 several tanks to start handing out 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.450
 come to life left and right in the zone 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.090
 lesions appear from 3 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.099
 and immediately snatches at 140 and here 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.280
 see one of the most difficult maneuvers 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.069
 for damaging exactly on 4 pennies for three with 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.160
 half or even 5 and even 4 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.049
 on the right shows from this 485 gets 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.910
 legal spank drives back 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.099
 trying to shoot but he fails 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.530
 Is-3 is trying to attack at this time 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.319
 our hero and takes on average 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.000
 landing damage in 4 seconds now we 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.370
 we see how the panther heals such 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.709
 vulnerabilities as hatch for ejection 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.230
 garbage on the third Ise and at the same time 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.750
 turns away from the third isa tower to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.060
 show him how unpleasant he is 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.880
 at the same time red 30 four 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.370
 tanker armored lower he against all 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.560
 teams are green and how we see her 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.049
 it turns out very well 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.840
 a message from team chat appears 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.420
 r panther that it recharges 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.239
 This is a signal for our hero to 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.730
 correctly stand under the mountain and does not move 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.340
 exactly until this recharge 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.130
 end why was this maneuver done 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.810
 we will never know on the scoreboard we see 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.819
 what is the current score 73 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.010
 which means that it is possible for a little 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.160
 roll cotton wool and take a little time out 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.410
 while the crew of our tank closes the holes 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.720
 in armor with sealant and plasticine 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.299
 tank mechanic indulges and 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.730
 riding back and forth this is done too 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.280
 not just now he trample down the ground 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.139
 in order to then as quickly as possible 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.269
 go to the rage we see how caught fire 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.130
 light bulb it means come the most 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.610
 best moment to ride 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.610
 bend the red team 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.890
 but friends are fate-villain and isu-152 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.930
 ordered otherwise with you was victor 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.930
 wuxi pusi thank you everyone everyone is free
