pretty painless but what you do is you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
pretty painless but what you do is you
basically<00:01:00.800> spread<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> laser<00:01:02.250> beam<00:01:02.579> over

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
basically spread that laser beam over

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.870 
basically spread that laser beam over
the<00:01:03.420> entire<00:01:03.780> surface<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.830> nail<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.640> nail

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the entire surface of the nail and nail

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
the entire surface of the nail and nail
bed<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.619> nine<00:01:08.250> months<00:01:08.670> later<00:01:08.729> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
bed and then about nine months later you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.670 
bed and then about nine months later you
don't<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.869> any<00:01:10.080> results<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
don't really see any results what it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.899 
don't really see any results what it
does<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.950> kills<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> fungus<00:01:11.760> that's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
does it kills all the fungus that's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.700 
does it kills all the fungus that's
underneath<00:01:12.299> then<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> nail<00:01:13.500> bed

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
underneath then they and in the nail bed

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
underneath then they and in the nail bed
so<00:01:13.860> any<00:01:14.040> new<00:01:14.369> nail<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> grows<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> going

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so any new nail that grows in is going

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.550 
so any new nail that grows in is going
to<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:15.960> good<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:18.229> half<00:01:19.229> way

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to look good just like that and half way

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.810 
to look good just like that and half way
I'd<00:01:19.830> show<00:01:20.100> them<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.670> they're

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
I'd show them to you now but they're
only<00:01:20.939> about<00:01:21.090> halfway<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> need

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
only about halfway good so I need

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
only about halfway good so I need
another<00:01:22.619> couple<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.159> months<00:01:25.490> point<00:01:26.490> doses<00:01:27.119> yes

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
another couple of months point doses yes

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
another couple of months point doses yes
