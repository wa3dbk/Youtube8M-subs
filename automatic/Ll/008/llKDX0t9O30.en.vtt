00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 it seems to me that I have not achieved anything 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.530
 although 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.880
 I can say a lot 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.459
 and training in the play Spartak 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.529
 when paint medals 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:13.289
 I want to remember how 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.439
 just wake up commit 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.460
 while you eat breakfast just 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.409
 record performances 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.119
 and only one overture already 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.289
 people for centuries that is already our reader and you 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.369
 you want 5 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.579
 human rights activist 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.879
 do you want dance 

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.879
 the performance is very valuable 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.530
 presumably boundaries 1 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.100
 branch was positive 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 not yet in the fact that the authorities spoil people 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 USA 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.710
 distinguished not like 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.480
 negative positive 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.770
 By compulsory hero can strong colors 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.030
 starting from the plastic cut off to give everything 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.050
 the strength of the entire costume makeup 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 it is very interesting 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.880
 probably for the last such a performance in 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.410
 my life which 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.410
 destroying the process of such creativity 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.240
 harder of course I had very little 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.869
 of time 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.219
 preparatory actions system 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.189
 made a full performance 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.189
 comes from the USSR that this performance 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:42.949
 in law 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.319
 four 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.140
 the whole territory of private life 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.520
 starting this fall i 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.160
 worked there for two years 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.260
 in the second and third year this was 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.519
 happiness that could work 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.790
 and after that i welcome cards but 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.939

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.579
 after which I wanted to go further 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.579
 no further comes to say 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.779
 Work St. Petersburg Nikolay

 boyars took me a small theater I 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.479

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.219
 after the contest 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.129

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.029
 suggested introducing to work on stage 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.699
 Mariinsky Theater would like to mention 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.310

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.080
 behalf of the Mariinsky Theater and the other 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.049
 the side 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.939
 and Mariinsky was a big theater and 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.309
 Today, he certainly can be obtained 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.169
 July 6, my theaters are here because they are not 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.139
 can now looked around very 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.259
 nice to remember 

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.299
 Iâ€™m writing a process because 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.099
 I can't leave my life alone 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.099
 a dozen 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.949
 I love to dance fast 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.649
 they are long sleeved 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.619
 and about the impossibility of timely but if 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.889
 it will be interesting 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.439
 need to be very careful 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.180
 but what can and support 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180
 last wednesday 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.349
 I wanted to finish it, of course 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.349
 many publications 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.180
 separate theater life 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.699
 unfortunately maybe 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.509
 because of course you want 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.129
 want to really want 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.250
 to achieve and to someone to be necessary and that he 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.349
 not every year also need a person to find 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.349
 its by the end of half 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.229
 I don't want to live 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.889
 and again not such prices 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:11.990
 stamps 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.689
 because it is necessary 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.689
 this opinion 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.689
 you do not want but I missed it man 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.689
 to be hungry because they are of this series 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.610
 traditional industries are thirsty 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.719
 that's what you don't want 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.719
 love passion 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.610
 most of all love football 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.840
 in several stages 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.129
 as a springboard 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.189
 the listed is mined you come 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.050
 theater I understand that it is to be where we are not 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.809
 will take 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:41.469
 during the big drama theater and 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:43.930
 no one knew comedy then 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.199
 I bought people here reigns 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.210
 For example, with a beautiful Pigareva 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.210
 what specialty interesting 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.229
 I will not sign tons why I want 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.509

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:15.919

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.919
 why not 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.080
 I will just do everything 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.470
