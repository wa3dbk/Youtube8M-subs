no<00:00:05.170> just<00:00:05.650> the<00:00:05.890> last<00:00:06.069> three<00:00:06.310> times<00:00:08.549> that<00:00:09.549> say

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
no just the last three times that say

no just the last three times that say
class<00:00:10.600> size

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:25.200 

you<00:00:15.100> have<00:00:15.250> together

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.669 

certainly<00:00:26.210> it's<00:00:26.480> some<00:00:26.719> time<00:00:27.349> trial<00:00:27.590> after

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
certainly it's some time trial after

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.589 
certainly it's some time trial after
food<00:00:28.039> after<00:00:28.609> three<00:00:28.849> weeks<00:00:29.000> of<00:00:29.179> racing's

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
food after three weeks of racing's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.049 
food after three weeks of racing's
different<00:00:30.050> than<00:00:30.199> nine<00:00:30.859> days<00:00:31.130> of<00:00:31.309> racing<00:00:31.489> but

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
different than nine days of racing but

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.299 
different than nine days of racing but
some<00:00:32.329> in<00:00:32.989> terms<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.320> having<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.589> buffer<00:00:33.949> I<00:00:33.980> think

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
some in terms of having a buffer I think

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.530 
some in terms of having a buffer I think
the<00:00:34.399> best<00:00:34.550> way<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:34.790> go<00:00:34.940> into<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.149> last<00:00:35.300> time

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
the best way to go into the last time

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.930 
the best way to go into the last time
trial<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:35.989> five<00:00:36.290> minutes<00:00:36.620> lead<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.820> then

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
trial is a five minutes lead and then

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.790 
trial is a five minutes lead and then
you<00:00:38.030> could<00:00:38.180> just<00:00:38.269> cruise<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.019> see<00:00:39.620> whether

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
you could just cruise in and see whether

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.819 
you could just cruise in and see whether
you<00:00:39.949> train<00:00:40.190> for<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.550> Olympics<00:00:40.940> or<00:00:41.149> or<00:00:42.110> go<00:00:42.620> for

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
you train for the Olympics or or go for

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.829 
you train for the Olympics or or go for
the<00:00:42.920> stage<00:00:43.159> win<00:00:43.479> yeah<00:00:44.479> looking<00:00:44.780> at

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
the stage win yeah looking at

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.560 
the stage win yeah looking at
yesterday's<00:00:45.260> results<00:00:46.180> logic<00:00:47.180> would<00:00:47.210> say<00:00:47.540> I

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
yesterday's results logic would say I

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.630 
yesterday's results logic would say I
need<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.870> big<00:00:48.110> buffer<00:00:48.409> going<00:00:48.680> into<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.949> long<00:00:49.369> time

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
need a big buffer going into a long time

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.570 
need a big buffer going into a long time
trial<00:00:50.000> but<00:00:50.269> some<00:00:50.600> there<00:00:51.379> also<00:00:51.739> Bradley's

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
not that I saw anything that I hadn't

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.710 
not that I saw anything that I hadn't
seen<00:01:55.479> before<00:01:55.540> but<00:01:56.049> he's<00:01:56.259> a<00:01:56.290> very<00:01:57.600> instead<00:01:58.600> of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
seen before but he's a very instead of

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.450 
seen before but he's a very instead of
like<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.020> time<00:01:59.200> trailer<00:01:59.439> stick<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.920> climb<00:02:00.190> I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
like the time trailer stick and climb I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.130 
like the time trailer stick and climb I
think<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.000> was<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.299> thought<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.630> was<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.899> climber

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
think I was I thought it was the climber

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.950 
think I was I thought it was the climber
that<00:02:02.289> could<00:02:02.590> learn<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.039> Tom<00:02:03.250> trial<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
that could learn to Tom trial and and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.350 
that could learn to Tom trial and and
and<00:02:05.289> those<00:02:05.470> type<00:02:05.740> are<00:02:05.920> always<00:02:06.130> right<00:02:07.000> at<00:02:07.180> one

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
and those type are always right at one

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.210

finisher I look back and maybe we should
have<00:02:29.560> been<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> bit<00:02:30.459> more<00:02:30.610> aggressive<00:02:30.700> or<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.390> on

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
have been a bit more aggressive or so on

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.170 
have been a bit more aggressive or so on
but<00:02:32.500> some<00:02:32.830> being<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.370> first<00:02:33.580> hilltop<00:02:33.880> finish

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.809 
but some being the first hilltop finish
I<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.380> find<00:02:35.560> out<00:02:35.830> truly<00:02:36.040> for<00:02:36.340> myself<00:02:36.670> what

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
I have to find out truly for myself what

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.000 
I have to find out truly for myself what
my<00:02:36.970> level<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:38.350> when<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:38.650> go<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.799> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
my level is and now when we go to the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.830 
my level is and now when we go to the
next<00:02:39.160> climb<00:02:39.430> or<00:02:39.730> also<00:02:40.209> toss<00:02:40.420> we're<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.780> think

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
next climb or also toss we're I think

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.979 
next climb or also toss we're I think
gran<00:02:41.290> colombia<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> very<00:02:43.000> hard<00:02:43.630> hard

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
gran colombia it's it's a very hard hard

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.509 
gran colombia it's it's a very hard hard
climb<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:45.040> long<00:02:45.160> way<00:02:45.280> from<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
climb but it's a long way from the

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.090 
climb but it's a long way from the
finish<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.090> I<00:02:46.120> think<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.840> ask<00:02:47.410> we<00:02:47.620> will<00:02:47.860> really

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
finish but I think to ask we will really

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.060 
finish but I think to ask we will really
be<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.430> climbers<00:02:49.470> where<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.560> climbers<00:02:50.950> will

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
be the climbers where the climbers will

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.979 
be the climbers where the climbers will
shine<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.730> dumb<00:02:51.970> yeah<00:02:52.150> we'll<00:02:52.359> see<00:02:52.570> how<00:02:52.750> come

about<00:03:23.959> my<00:03:24.230> approach<00:03:24.439> the<00:03:24.799> two<00:03:25.010> maybe<00:03:25.599> it's<00:03:26.599> um

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
about my approach the two maybe it's um

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.009 
about my approach the two maybe it's um
yeah<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.769> suppose<00:03:28.250> especially<00:03:28.970> in<00:03:29.540> my<00:03:29.750> mind
