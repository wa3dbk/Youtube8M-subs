00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
capacity as sprint EVO 4G so battery
life<00:01:36.420> big<00:01:36.810> question<00:01:37.470> mark<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.979> point<00:01:38.250> but

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
life big question mark at this point but

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.560 
life big question mark at this point but
I<00:01:38.430> bet<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.030> similar<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
I bet it's going to be very similar to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.240 
I bet it's going to be very similar to
the<00:01:39.720> 4g<00:01:40.049> maybe<00:01:40.409> even<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.680> less<00:01:41.009> because

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the 4g maybe even a little less because

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
the 4g maybe even a little less because
the<00:01:41.460> size<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.880> screen<00:01:42.270> there's<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the size of that screen there's a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.460 
the size of that screen there's a
microSD<00:01:43.530> card<00:01:44.250> hidden<00:01:45.000> under<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> back<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
microSD card hidden under the back and

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.710 
microSD card hidden under the back and
it's<00:01:46.950> actually<00:01:47.759> fairly<00:01:47.909> easy<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.600> apart

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it's actually fairly easy to take apart

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's actually fairly easy to take apart
but<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.920> means<00:01:50.060> microSD<00:01:51.060> means<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> add

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
but that means microSD means you can add

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120 
but that means microSD means you can add
expansion<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.290> there<00:01:52.470> which<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.100> now

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
expansion on there which right now

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
expansion on there which right now
pretty<00:01:53.640> sure<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.000> max<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.420> 32<00:01:55.049> gigabytes<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
pretty sure is a max of 32 gigabytes the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.039 
pretty sure is a max of 32 gigabytes the
one<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> comes<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.540> think<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.869> two

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
one that comes with it I think it's two

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.420 
one that comes with it I think it's two
gigabytes<00:01:58.469> or<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.799> two<00:01:58.950> gigabytes<00:01:59.280> onboard

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
gigabytes or it's two gigabytes onboard

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
gigabytes or it's two gigabytes onboard
and<00:02:00.119> that's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> 16<00:02:01.140> gigabyte<00:02:02.810> card<00:02:03.810> we

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and that's a 16 gigabyte card we

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
and that's a 16 gigabyte card we
actually<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:04.979> now<00:02:05.130> snappy

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
actually have in there right now snappy

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
actually have in there right now snappy
performance<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.540> pretty<00:02:06.780> good<00:02:07.049> as

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
performance is actually pretty good as

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.980 
performance is actually pretty good as
always<00:02:08.360> Wi-Fi<00:02:09.360> works<00:02:09.840> better

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
always Wi-Fi works better

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.040 
always Wi-Fi works better

there<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.980> will<00:02:15.100> be<00:02:15.190> good<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.490> my<00:02:15.610> purse<00:02:15.850> but

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
there this will be good for my purse but

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.760 
there this will be good for my purse but
maybe<00:02:16.270> not<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.570> good<00:02:16.720> for<00:02:16.750> your<00:02:16.960> pockets<00:02:17.350> yeah

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
maybe not so good for your pockets yeah

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
carry it around um probably not like

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.920 
carry it around um probably not like
this<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:41.740> I'm<00:02:41.890> perhaps<00:02:42.570> put<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.750> my<00:02:43.870> purse

this but I'm perhaps put it in my purse
I<00:02:44.380> mean<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.620> not<00:02:44.710> so<00:02:44.890> bad<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.130> mean<00:02:45.370> compared

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
I mean it's not so bad I mean compared

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.340 
I mean it's not so bad I mean compared
to<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> other<00:02:46.360> android<00:02:46.750> phones<00:02:46.810> we've<00:02:47.140> seen

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
to the other android phones we've seen

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.920 
to the other android phones we've seen
out<00:02:47.500> there<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.890> sits<00:02:48.310> on<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:48.610> bigger<00:02:48.820> side<00:02:48.930> but

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
out there it sits on the bigger side but

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.050 
out there it sits on the bigger side but
if<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.590> want<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> really<00:02:50.980> big<00:02:51.310> space<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.880> web

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
if you want a really big space for web

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.580 
if you want a really big space for web
browsing<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.630> for<00:02:52.840> running<00:02:53.080> all<00:02:53.170> those<00:02:53.350> apps

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
browsing and for running all those apps

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.010 
browsing and for running all those apps
it's<00:02:53.860> not<00:02:54.040> not<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.490> bad<00:02:54.640> it's<00:02:54.850> pretty<00:02:54.880> cute<00:02:55.210> you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
it's not not so bad it's pretty cute you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.570 
it's not not so bad it's pretty cute you
know<00:02:56.050> put<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> little<00:02:56.710> stand<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.370> get<00:02:57.460> your

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
know put a little stand on it get your

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.280 
know put a little stand on it get your
Bluetooth<00:02:57.850> keyboard<00:02:58.360> going<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.900> mean<00:02:59.140> just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
Bluetooth keyboard going I mean just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.840 
Bluetooth keyboard going I mean just
think<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.680> old<00:02:59.860> like<00:03:00.220> personal<00:03:00.700> media

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
think of the old like personal media

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.790 
think of the old like personal media
players<00:03:01.240> of<00:03:01.540> back<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:01.960> day<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.560> know<00:03:02.770> like

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
players of back in the day you know like

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.150 
players of back in the day you know like
this<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.880> bad<00:03:04.390> time<00:03:04.420> but<00:03:05.170> thinner<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.770> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
this is a bad time but thinner it is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.830 
this is a bad time but thinner it is
also<00:03:06.340> PSP<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> little<00:03:07.150> higher<00:03:07.330> this<00:03:07.510> way<00:03:07.660> but

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
also PSP a little higher this way but

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.240 
also PSP a little higher this way but
it's<00:03:07.960> got<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.080> bigger<00:03:08.260> screen<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:09.100> think

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
it's got a bigger screen and I think

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.580 
it's got a bigger screen and I think
