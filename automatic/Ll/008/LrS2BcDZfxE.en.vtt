00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.710
 i 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.700
 well then the first advice that I'm going 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.050
 to give will be to charge their cameras 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.910
 using one of these this brings you many 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.660
 of cell phones models this is from 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.739
 iphone android has also 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.700
 So what he's going to do is 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.700
 such wagons 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.110
 close to double tube but to this this 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.240
 you are going to connect the outlet of the wall 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.240
 and then you will connect your camera 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.990
 loading your camera on the wall is going to 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.110
 make the camera perform more than when 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.780
 the load from the computer is going to be 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 the same if the load on the car in the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.520
 car on the wall will render issues that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.190
 loading the from the good computer 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.020
 Well now I have two more tricks 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.020
 I like to use the first one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.440
 turning off the lights of the ine 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.340
 the first one is turning off the lights 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 halliday 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.140
 I always have them off this 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.140
 way I keep the battery 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.829
 and the second advice is 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:00.060
 the second advice to learn one button 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.920
 what this does is that I turn on the camera 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.290
 and I start recording the payment so it leaves 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.020
 to record for example 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.880
 in the camera for example we are swimming 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 I'm swimming on a beach and see a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.020
 turtle 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.790
 so I turn on the camera 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.069
 and she's just going to start recording as 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.280
 is doing right now 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.469
 then after that the turtle 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.290
 they are going to give can I already want to stop the 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.659
 video if you give the button above the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.189
 camera will not do anything to do that 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.849
 already stop recording you have to use the 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:39.689
 this button leave it tight so that the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.689
 camera turn off 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.080
 what 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.410
 As we turn off the lights I will recommend 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.420
 to become familiar with the sounds of 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.750
 turning on the camera and turning off the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.750
 camera 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.470
 then to get it out of wang button 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.000
 mount what we're going to want the sele 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.060
 leave this button up tight 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.890
 we leave it tight and the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.570
 tools let's go into the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.570
 tool opening giving it up 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.280
 We are going to enter one button and we are going to 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.280
 pay 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.209
 and the camera is not a good button 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.209
 this video 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.599
 in this video we are going to decide how much is 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.599
 the difference d
