00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.919
 Halli hello here at noon and I greet 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.639
 the third challenge for you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 magic 2014 war tactics is available today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.740
 on the plan 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.029
 we have to win within this 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 let's take a look at that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 battlefield looks like should not 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.230
 are always too complicated 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.630
 still the simple challenges and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.779
 yes our opponent has two creatures 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.520
 once a central computer 33 once 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.170
 a very close flying alertness 44 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 has new life points that's us 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.610
 have to do harm in the new one and we 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.250
 three creatures have a dominion 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.350
 paper 32 and two little beers 22 good things 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
 we have a land for hand destroy 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.129
 or a non-black creature one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.309
 either s or she can not 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.960
 be regenerated when talking about it 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.239
 Thinking brings us that at all 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.590
 not further this card because no matter if 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.480
 with them very close or the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 destroy central computer then stop 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 two creatures of us and blocked but 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.010
 We then do a maximum of four damage 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.610
 he 'll turn to the vampire so well 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.869
 lightning then you would have one here 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.759
 player of his choice loses 4 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 Life points duels many life points 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.500
 it does not get us that way either 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.030
 You can not really do that in front of everything 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.030
 is at once because of the speak 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.140
 Painter costs are quite high 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.180
 that would be our whole 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.610
 Betrayed painters could do nothing more 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 only two more harms brings us 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 So nothing which card brings only 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.450
 second, of course, the one that is left 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.720
 a creature of your choice gets plus 7 + 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.210
 7 to the end of the train important in 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.549
 This card is not yours 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.530
 play the fight but only if 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.360
 the good he has assigned his blogger 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.430
 and then, logically, to the creature 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.799
 which is still blocked then 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.799
 So now interrupt parts 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:10.500
 This one is unkempt and calls it 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:17.730
 thus becomes a 99 to a 99 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.560
 Bear and coarse salt made and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.090
 we would have the third 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.090
 challenge behind us 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.629
 next time is blood 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.800
 live in line and in this sense 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.940
 My name is noon, thank you 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.310
 for to look and see you 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.239
 hopefully at the next video again 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.239
 ciao
