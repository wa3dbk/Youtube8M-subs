00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 we come to my new tutorial 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 Today I want to show you how to do it yourself 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.280
 an external disk created from 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.910
 an old laptop hard disk or one 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.549
 ssd 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:17.670
 we need as 25 inches housing here 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.029
 Usb 2 or even 3 0 connection costs 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.680
 between 10 and 20 euros usually that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.140
 then it will be delivered then most of the time 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.730
 already open 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.400
 that's how it looks from the inside and on 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 housing and then of course we need 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 even more two and a half inch hard drive 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.920
 For example, we left over from an old laptop 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.390
 or we still have a ssd out 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.420
 we get a super fast external 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.289
 want to build a hard drive with usb 3.0 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.370
 this is an ssd for example now 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.570
 notebook hard disk looks but in the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.510
 usually just as well yes then we need 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.809
 actually only the hard drive in the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 dedicated plug-in board for 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:14.580
 so that should usually be stuck 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 not too hard to go already 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.210
 bit press but too much violence 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.250
 you should not really use 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.049
 of course always very important 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 before you go too electronic stuff 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.060
 works that one is called that earth 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.579
 He should someday be a radiator 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240
 or what else valued 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.820
 metal 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 so that one unloads one should also 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.869
 Be careful not to put things on 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.329
 of which one knows that one then oneself 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.250
 is charging eg polyester police or 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.899
 like this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.340
 ok with the housing you put it now 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.000
 just like that on everyone 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 housing is different but the principle is one 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.009
 takes the 2 half-time hard drive stuck 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.880
 Just put it on the board 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.399
 two and a half inches housing and finished 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 the external hard disk to the screws 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.050
 are attracted 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.880
 it is very nice 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.360
 as said that it is made of aluminum 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.090
 two and a half two usb 2.0 casing 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.520
 between 10 and 20 euro costs something like that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.310
 optimal if you have an old laptop 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.180
 has disk lying around or with 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.820
 a ssd cheap fast external 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.530
 wants to build hard drive stuck that straight 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.180
 it's really about to prove it 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.140
 an external one is that easy 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.140
 to build hard disk 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.340
 then shines so cool blue here 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 folder open there we have it already 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.400
 ssd works fine and now you can 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.659
 we save data on it 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.379
 thanks for watching and subscribing 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.379
