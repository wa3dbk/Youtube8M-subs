necessarily a hundred percent sure if
that<00:05:16.010> even<00:05:16.280> works<00:05:16.610> so<00:05:17.090> if<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.300> isn't<00:05:17.540> just

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
that even works so if it isn't just

about<00:05:24.350> $60<00:05:25.250> tack<00:05:25.520> on<00:05:25.700> another<00:05:25.730> 140<00:05:26.540> and<00:05:26.840> you

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
about $60 tack on another 140 and you

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.890 
about $60 tack on another 140 and you
get<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.290> 4k<00:05:27.620> capable<00:05:28.340> chromecast<00:05:29.150> essentially

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.590 
ecosystem but I do think that this thing
is<00:05:52.520> seriously<00:05:52.850> cool<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:53.270> if<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.420> have<00:05:53.510> the

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
is seriously cool and if you have the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.970 
is seriously cool and if you have the
budget<00:05:53.780> for<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.320> it<00:05:54.440> could<00:05:54.590> be<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.740> great

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
budget for it it could be a great
