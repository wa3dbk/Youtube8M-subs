00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
of see linkages here you can adjust the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.759 
of see linkages here you can adjust the
distance<00:00:22.080> between<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.949> top<00:00:23.550> pieces<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.769> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
distance between the top pieces and the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.230 
distance between the top pieces and the
bottom<00:00:26.160> piece<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.609> holding<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> camera

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
bottom piece it's holding the camera

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.500 
bottom piece it's holding the camera
down<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.670> catch<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.150> missed

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
down here see so you can catch a missed

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.340 
down here see so you can catch a missed
ins<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:31.769> angle<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.780> right<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
ins the angle and this right here is

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.160 
ins the angle and this right here is
going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.770> handle<00:00:35.570> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
going to be your handle this is this is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
going to be your handle this is this is
how<00:00:37.320> you're<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> control<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.399> angle<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
how you're going to control the angle of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.510 
how you're going to control the angle of
the<00:00:41.879> camera<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.770> exactly<00:00:44.160> quite

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the camera and it's not exactly quite

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.350 
the camera and it's not exactly quite
the<00:00:45.030> way<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.510> planning<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.079> being<00:00:47.360> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the way I was planning on it being so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639 
the way I was planning on it being so
you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:48.870> I've<00:00:48.989> done<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.469> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you can see what I've done here is I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.209 
you can see what I've done here is I
just<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.539> couple<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.660> nuts<00:00:52.219> welded

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
just have a couple of nuts welded

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.779 
just have a couple of nuts welded
together<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.980> attach<00:00:56.399> them<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
together here and they attach them to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
together here and they attach them to
these<00:00:56.879> carriage<00:00:57.270> bolts<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
these carriage bolts that are all on the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
these carriage bolts that are all on the
outside<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.039> arms<00:00:59.460> and<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.600> kind

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
outside of these arms and you can kind

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.439 
outside of these arms and you can kind
of<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.020> how<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.320> arms<00:01:01.590> pivot<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.449> around

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
of see how these arms pivot here around

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.830 
of see how these arms pivot here around
these<00:01:03.600> L<00:01:03.809> brackets<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.619> cut<00:01:04.830> off

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
these L brackets that I just cut off

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
these L brackets that I just cut off
okay<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.460> then<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.610> threaded<00:01:09.000> rod<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
okay and then that threaded rod and you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
okay and then that threaded rod and you
can<00:01:14.490> see<00:01:14.670> again<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.330> another<00:01:15.600> threaded

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
can see again I have another threaded

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.830 
can see again I have another threaded
rod<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:17.009> handle<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:20.570> then<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> goes

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
rod that's my handle and then it goes

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
rod that's my handle and then it goes
through<00:01:21.869> these<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.159> nut<00:01:23.400> actually

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
through these and this this nut actually

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
through these and this this nut actually
isn't<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> same<00:01:24.450> size<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
isn't the same size as the as the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
isn't the same size as the as the
threaded<00:01:26.430> rod<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.759> actually<00:01:27.090> size<00:01:27.330> bigger

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
threaded rod it's actually size bigger

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
threaded rod it's actually size bigger
so<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> it'll<00:01:28.380> slide<00:01:28.710> back<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.100> forth<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
so that it'll slide back and forth and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
so that it'll slide back and forth and
then<00:01:29.640> these<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:30.030> nuts<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.439> they

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
then these two nuts here and here they

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
then these two nuts here and here they
just<00:01:31.860> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.280> lock<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.939> shut<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:34.110> these

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
just kind of lock it shut and then these

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.690 
just kind of lock it shut and then these
not<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.650> weld<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.920> together<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.549> they

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
not to weld it together so that they

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
not to weld it together so that they
connect<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> carriage<00:01:37.290> bolts<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.710> are

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
connect to the carriage bolts that are

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.330 
connect to the carriage bolts that are
here

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
here

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.789 
here
we're<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.390> even<00:01:39.540> carriage<00:01:39.869> bolts<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.259> hex

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
we're not even carriage bolts but hex

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.530 
we're not even carriage bolts but hex
bolts<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.670> how<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
bolts so you can kind of see how the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.410 
bolts so you can kind of see how the
mechanism<00:01:46.140> swivels<00:01:46.700> pretty<00:01:47.700> easily<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
mechanism swivels pretty easily that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.899 
mechanism swivels pretty easily that
bolt<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> center<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.450> attaches<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:53.700> all

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
bolt in the center there attaches it all

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.100 
bolt in the center there attaches it all
to<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> pleat<00:01:54.479> for<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> tripod<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> nice

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
to the pleat for the tripod got a nice

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
to the pleat for the tripod got a nice
heavy-duty<00:01:58.110> Boggan<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:59.490> course<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> heavy-duty

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
heavy-duty Boggan of course a heavy-duty

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
heavy-duty Boggan of course a heavy-duty
tripod<00:02:00.420> something<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.229> big<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.619> heavy

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
tripod something really big and heavy

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.459 
tripod something really big and heavy
it's<00:02:02.360> definitely<00:02:03.360> an<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.689> must<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.140> something

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it's definitely an a must for something

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.230 
it's definitely an a must for something
like<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.009> else<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> will<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:06.119> real

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
like this or else it will just be real

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.339 
like this or else it will just be real
top-heavy<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.619> can<00:02:08.270> put

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
top-heavy and then I can put

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.190 
top-heavy and then I can put
counterweight<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.569> whatever<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:12.810> wanted

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
counterweight in there whatever I wanted

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.869 
counterweight in there whatever I wanted
to<00:02:13.260> do<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:15.120> would<00:02:15.239> work<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.599> really<00:02:15.840> well<00:02:16.110> so

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
to do and would work out really well so

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.600 
to do and would work out really well so
let's<00:02:17.879> up<00:02:18.060> at<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.360> camera<00:02:18.659> on<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.159> on<00:02:20.159> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
let's up at the camera on here on the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.640 
let's up at the camera on here on the
thing<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:20.970> we'll<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.269> couple<00:02:21.420> tests<00:02:21.870> see

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
thing and we'll do a couple tests see

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.920 
thing and we'll do a couple tests see
what<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.829> looks<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.209> okay<00:02:24.209> so<00:02:24.360> essentially

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
what it looks like okay so essentially

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.149 
what it looks like okay so essentially
is<00:02:25.170> you're<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.099> to

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
is you're going to see this is going to

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:37.160 
is you're going to see this is going to
end<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.310> being<00:02:26.519> two<00:02:26.819> handed<00:02:27.209> operation<00:02:36.170> handle

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
end up being two handed operation handle

00:02:37.170 --> 00:03:13.849 
end up being two handed operation handle
here<00:03:07.879> essentially<00:03:12.109> great<00:03:13.109> Jeep<00:03:13.379> with<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.739> a

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
here essentially great Jeep with just a

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:19.830 
here essentially great Jeep with just a
few<00:03:14.010> pieces<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.519> wood

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.350 

so<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.900> can<00:03:21.260> see<00:03:21.439> how<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.590> can<00:03:21.909> put<00:03:22.909> it<00:03:23.030> off<00:03:23.180> in

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
so you can see how I can put it off in

00:03:23.360 --> 00:04:09.750 
so you can see how I can put it off in
school

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.819 

you
