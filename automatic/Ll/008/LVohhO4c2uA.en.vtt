you're going to lay it lengthwise you're
going<00:00:32.710> to<00:00:32.800> use<00:00:32.950> a<00:00:33.160> ruler<00:00:33.820> you're<00:00:34.600> basically

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
going to use a ruler you're basically

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.410 
going to use a ruler you're basically
going<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.500> be<00:00:35.560> measuring<00:00:36.130> it<00:00:36.250> in<00:00:36.399> half<00:00:36.700> so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
going to be measuring it in half so

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.450 
going to be measuring it in half so
you're<00:00:37.630> going<00:00:37.899> to<00:00:38.010> 411<00:00:39.010> it's<00:00:39.160> going<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.370> be

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
you're going to 411 it's going to be

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.799 
you're going to 411 it's going to be
five<00:00:39.700> and<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.970> half<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:40.390> I'm<00:00:40.480> just<00:00:40.660> going<00:00:40.780> to

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
five and a half so I'm just going to

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.220 
five and a half so I'm just going to
make<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.020> tiny<00:00:41.530> little<00:00:41.940> mark<00:00:42.940> there<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.840> show<00:00:44.050> me

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
make a tiny little mark there to show me

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.150 
make a tiny little mark there to show me
where<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.679> midpoint<00:00:45.129> is<00:00:45.809> then<00:00:46.859> I'm<00:00:47.859> going<00:00:48.100> to

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
where the midpoint is then I'm going to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.860 
where the midpoint is then I'm going to
take<00:00:48.399> your<00:00:48.579> paper<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.030> turn<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.839> other

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
way and you're going to lay your ruler

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.810 
way and you're going to lay your ruler
down<00:00:53.109> again<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:54.359> that<00:00:55.359> it's<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.320> 11

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
down again so that it's to the 11

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.090 
down again so that it's to the 11
measuring<00:00:57.820> point<00:00:58.210> and<00:00:58.539> you're<00:00:59.499> first<00:00:59.859> going

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
measuring point and you're first going

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
measuring point and you're first going
to<00:01:00.190> measure<00:01:00.429> at<00:01:00.760> two<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.600> three<00:01:02.140> quarters<00:01:02.679> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
to measure at two and three quarters and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.800 
to measure at two and three quarters and
again<00:01:05.260> at<00:01:05.620> eight<00:01:05.980> and<00:01:06.370> one<00:01:06.730> quarter<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:09.810> turn

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
again at eight and one quarter so turn

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.870 
again at eight and one quarter so turn
your<00:01:10.960> paper<00:01:11.140> back<00:01:11.409> over<00:01:11.770> again<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.490> you've<00:01:12.700> got

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
your paper back over again so you've got

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.300 
your paper back over again so you've got
the<00:01:13.000> one<00:01:13.180> mark<00:01:13.420> at<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.720> top<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.890> can<00:01:15.070> if

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
the one mark at the top and you can if

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.090 
the one mark at the top and you can if
you<00:01:15.520> drew<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.820> line<00:01:16.180> from<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.229> point<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.920> this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
you drew a line from this point to this

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.100 
you drew a line from this point to this
point<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.759> from<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.180> point<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.689> this<00:01:19.810> point

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
point and from this point to this point

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.870 
point and from this point to this point
you<00:01:20.320> could<00:01:20.500> see<00:01:20.710> where<00:01:21.009> your<00:01:21.220> first<00:01:21.460> pennant

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
you could see where your first pennant

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.830 
you could see where your first pennant
is<00:01:22.090> use<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.780> bone<00:01:23.110> folder<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.590> score<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.840> subtle

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
is use a bone folder to score a subtle

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.590 
is use a bone folder to score a subtle
line<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:27.250> your<00:01:27.430> points<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.030> then<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:28.450> use

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
line to your points and then you can use

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.770 
line to your points and then you can use
scissors<00:01:28.899> to<00:01:29.079> cut<00:01:29.500> it<00:01:29.560> out<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.479> don't<00:01:31.630> have

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
scissors to cut it out if you don't have

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.160 
scissors to cut it out if you don't have
a<00:01:32.490> paper<00:01:33.490> cutter<00:01:33.820> you<00:01:34.420> just<00:01:34.630> find<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.020> easier

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
a paper cutter you just find it easier

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.530 
a paper cutter you just find it easier
to<00:01:35.469> just<00:01:35.860> line<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.159> up<00:01:36.399> on<00:01:36.640> my<00:01:36.759> trimmer<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.299> cut

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
to just line it up on my trimmer and cut

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.420 
to just line it up on my trimmer and cut
it<00:01:37.719> it<00:01:37.899> makes<00:01:38.110> it<00:01:38.229> shorter<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:38.740> faster<00:01:39.100> and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
it it makes it shorter and faster and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.459 
it it makes it shorter and faster and
less<00:01:39.610> stuff<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.060> do<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.689> I'm<00:01:41.049> just<00:01:41.110> going<00:01:41.439> to

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
less stuff to do so I'm just going to

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.080 
less stuff to do so I'm just going to
take<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.829> corner<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.369> I'm<00:01:42.579> going<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.820> line<00:01:43.060> it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
take the corner and I'm going to line it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.590 
take the corner and I'm going to line it
up<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:44.259> line<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:45.039> is<00:01:45.310> where<00:01:45.969> my<00:01:46.299> blade

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
up on the line that is where my blade

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.469 
up on the line that is where my blade
runs<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.250> you're<00:01:48.670> just<00:01:48.759> going<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.000> put<00:01:49.210> the

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
runs so you're just going to put the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.929 
runs so you're just going to put the
corner<00:01:50.289> into<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.560> groove<00:01:50.950> then<00:01:51.610> you're<00:01:51.789> going

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
corner into the groove then you're going

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.279 
corner into the groove then you're going

lines up with the groove down this way

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.770 
lines up with the groove down this way
and<00:02:01.280> slice<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> line<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:06.360> mark
