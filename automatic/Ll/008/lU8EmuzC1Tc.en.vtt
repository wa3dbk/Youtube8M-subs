control has been a challenge the fix for
his<00:01:20.150> second<00:01:20.750> leg<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.260> going<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.560> be<00:01:21.680> much<00:01:21.860> more

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
his second leg is going to be much more

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.370 
his second leg is going to be much more
extensive<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:22.880> expensive<00:01:23.090> than<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.050> fix

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
extensive and expensive than the fix

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.800 
extensive and expensive than the fix
that<00:01:24.560> was<00:01:24.680> done<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:24.890> his<00:01:25.250> first<00:01:25.550> leg<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.270> they

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
that was done on his first leg so they

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.590 
that was done on his first leg so they
actually<00:01:26.960> have<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.830> change<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.970> angle<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.420> his

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
actually have to change the angle of his

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.170 
actually have to change the angle of his
bone<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:30.650> make<00:01:30.890> sure<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.610> going<00:01:31.910> to<00:01:32.150> be

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
bone to make sure that it is going to be

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.750 
bone to make sure that it is going to be
stable<00:01:33.170> for<00:01:33.380> him<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:34.040> have<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.340> quality<00:01:34.730> of

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
life that he needs for his size and his

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.520 
life that he needs for his size and his
age<00:01:37.370> wall<00:01:38.150> Bart's<00:01:38.420> been<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.720> foster<00:01:38.930> care<00:01:39.290> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
age wall Bart's been in foster care the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.230 
age wall Bart's been in foster care the
most<00:01:39.860> difficult<00:01:40.400> part<00:01:40.460> has<00:01:40.820> actually<00:01:41.150> been

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
most difficult part has actually been

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.470 
most difficult part has actually been
limiting<00:01:41.750> his<00:01:42.159> activity<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.400> our<00:01:44.090> household
