00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 What's up friends of youtube that once 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.140
 denser and bringing them a video of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 black ops 2 and then on this occasion 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.700
 we are playing what is team 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.800
 deathmatch that would be duel by teams and 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.689
 because this time we are occupying what 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.930
 it is this weapon if I am not mistaken the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.329
 name is called Scorpio and then let me 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.550
 tell him it's one of the submachine guns that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.250
 I've been testing I've tried several 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.829
 submachine guns but in my opinion is one of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.340
 those that I liked the most for the reason 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.860
 that has a good shot of bullets that is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 shoots many ballads in reality this 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.660
 weapon then it 's a little easier to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.620
 kill the enemy here I bring you what 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.540
 is the laser but you see that when you 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 puts them what the muffler or be 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.680
 the weapons have to be a little more 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.840
 weak for the reason that then no longer 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.180
 they have not so much scope but 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.009
 weapon in that sense I who has been 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.320
 occupying this is one of my gameplays 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.090
 I played with her and I took what is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.579
 the silencer in another than in another 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.350
 departure and then let me tell you that 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.479
 still the weapon or you feel that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.380
 it still brings power like it did not have 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.829
 the muffler 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.020
 and then here we were playing bringing what 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.110
 It was the me and it brought me the package and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.640
 I brought this plane that was like bombs and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.750
 Well let's see to see what the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 so I usually pack 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.970
 I have a luck that gives me only the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.130
 cart or pure self and then it came 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.259
 here we are going to grab that gave us then we 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.210
 gave the fire dragon that this plane in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.069
 reality is very good that then 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.619
 according to was the one that came out in the edition of the 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.270
 package that we have there yet 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.920
 We have not flown it but then after a while 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.770
 let's see to see what wave we are going to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.909
 grab here this let's fly it 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.640
 let me see let's go find the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.979
 victims let see we are going to see here 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.429
 you see that there's action we're going to see the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.190
 heat marker then there we have grabbed 17 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.450
 Let's see marker here we are 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.190
 seeing that back here they are 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.170
 reappearing then here we have killed 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.030
 This let me I'll shoot it 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.490
 what's up what's Up 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.500
 actually and I saw that he gave me some 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.110
 hit marker but then you can also see 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.770
 the aim not failed me a little 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.069
 so then let's see already that 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.930
 let's see right now to see what we do 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.000
 we still need to grab what 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.460
 what is the plane we are going to take a turn 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.920
 over here 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.140
 I want to see here how they could see there 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.560
 is someone we are going to shoot 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.900
 this weapon let me tell you that it is not 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.370
 good as when someone going to kill 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 someone from long distance is not very 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.240
 good to let go the blast of a single 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.790
 because it tends to move too much 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.850
 the weapon has like too much recoil 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.810
 then it is preferable to shoot from 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.450
 little or not so that the weapon does not not 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.310
 of balance too not then here 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.370
 as you can see I bring this that is for 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.740
 vote them jude and then here we vote this 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.950
 I lived and we have grasped what is 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.500
 the plane this is good to bring that not 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.240
 because then you help your team by way of 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.340
 destroy it I lived so that they do not look at them 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.370
 and then at the same time or has the chance to 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.650
 to be able to grab something that is missing 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.390
 not as points for next time that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.250
 you so up how could you see 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.050
 we grabbed what was the plane going to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.760
 give us a tour here because you can see that 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.630
 there is action we are going to kill this one that is 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.520
 here and then we did not run out of bullets 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.560
 we grabbed there what is a shotgun and 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.330
 here we bring what is the enter 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.580
 that this is one of the first weapons 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.319
 that you unlock when you level 4 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.450
 and as you could see there is the 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.880
 enemy but here is fighting 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.410
 There, they already burst the squash 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.750
 then let's see here we're going to 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.310
 make the fool's play according to him 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.870
 think I'm on the other side but 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.480
 let me see we are going to turn around and 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.120
 we grab is marker but then we are going to 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.300
 see but here we do not kill him not that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.450
 Well, I electrocuted myself with those things 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.280
 they call him chargers I do not know how how 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.950
 will be the whole name but here 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.590
 we kill this we will see here and 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.630
 we have grabbed our and we are going to 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.049
 reload our weapon well here is 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.790
 this post they killed me in the back 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.350
 so then let's see then we're going 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.940
 to throw our I lived so that by 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.190
 our team knows where the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.560
 enemies not or is it very good when you 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.720
 you occupy as well as the small map because 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.150
 You see that you can tell where they are 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.729
 the enemies is a little easier the 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.590
 move around the map, not how they can 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.020
 see or the goal is unlocked in what 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.690
 level 55 almost to get away to for 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.500
 prestige then it's a little more good 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.540
 This is what 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.600
 the me and it came or it helps a little me 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.000
 that's why I bring it to throw things 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.710
 because when they throw away I lived then 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.380
 the votes not because then I bring what 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.030
 that either beach that I bring the footprint 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.770
 so then you can see me then 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.900
 here as you can see he killed this one and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.000
 we fail with the knife or I do not 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.700
 I understand how is that about the 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.440
 slashed as there are times they kill me 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.720
 of long distances with the knife and 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.000
 well how could they see there up close and not 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.250
 he hit him or whatever but we do not understand 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.020
 what happened not so here we are going to give us a 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.720
 eye plug here because I see that in the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.330
 people because there I also bring what is 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.700
 the c4 which is one of the ones that I like the most 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.880
 occupy almost do not occupy what are grenades 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.130
 nor the playmore I bring more what they are c4 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.590
 Well, how could you see here what 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.390
 they killed here we are going to follow it and then 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.610
 here friends the gameplay is ending 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.960
 I hope you liked the greeting 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.000
 of itself then we will continue to see 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.000
 until the next goodbye
