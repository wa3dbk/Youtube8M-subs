a<00:02:22.299> video<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:22.629> ariana<00:02:22.930> grande<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.319> think<00:02:23.680> she's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
a video of ariana grande I think she's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.199 
a video of ariana grande I think she's
worth<00:02:23.980> her<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.489> real<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.879> second

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
worth her and to be real for a second

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.430 
worth her and to be real for a second
that's<00:02:25.299> really<00:02:25.629> more<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> problem<00:02:26.049> with<00:02:26.319> her

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
that's really more of a problem with her

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.350 
that's really more of a problem with her
songs<00:02:26.739> than<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.159> her<00:02:27.310> videos<00:02:27.610> so<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.269> this

songs than with her videos so on this
upcoming<00:02:28.510> album<00:02:28.989> I'm<00:02:29.140> really<00:02:29.290> hoping<00:02:29.590> she<00:02:29.739> has

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
upcoming album I'm really hoping she has

upcoming album I'm really hoping she has
more<00:02:30.069> material<00:02:30.579> that's<00:02:30.790> deeper<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.540> can

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
more material that's deeper and can

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.809 
more material that's deeper and can
hopefully<00:02:32.440> produce<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:33.129> video<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.459> will<00:02:33.790> have

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819

be<00:02:44.019> even<00:02:44.620> better<00:02:44.890> than<00:02:45.160> her<00:02:45.310> first<00:02:45.579> which<00:02:45.819> I

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
be even better than her first which I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.670 
be even better than her first which I
was<00:02:46.090> already<00:02:46.390> obsessed<00:02:46.569> with<00:02:46.989> my<00:02:47.200> hope<00:02:47.379> for<00:02:47.410> it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
was already obsessed with my hope for it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.170 
was already obsessed with my hope for it
is<00:02:47.799> that<00:02:47.829> she'll<00:02:48.250> have<00:02:48.280> at<00:02:48.609> least<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.819> few<00:02:48.970> songs

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
is that she'll have at least a few songs

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.729 
is that she'll have at least a few songs
where<00:02:49.510> she<00:02:49.629> has<00:02:49.750> more<00:02:49.930> opportunity<00:02:50.530> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
where she has more opportunity to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.099 
where she has more opportunity to
showcase<00:02:51.340> her<00:02:51.730> vocals<00:02:52.150> because<00:02:52.629> she<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.870> so
