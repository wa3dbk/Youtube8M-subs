00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.570
 we are here here climbing park fun forest in the amsterdam forest 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:21.849
 the trees are promoting here 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.310
 for young and old 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 in principle you can come here from 8 years 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.809
 companies are very diverse with children and adults 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.780
 what is going on until we have at least four courses of the van here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.540
 seven that you have in the climbing park are suitable for children 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.990
 the climber then under the guidance of an adult it is important that it is true 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.990
 and with 14 years old, there are a lot of problems with his club 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.950
 9 during all ages 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.380
 then get it 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.460
 but it is certainly very good for the children 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.250
 vanhee meter took 30 and 8 years 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 they have it in three hours, they can easily climb via course 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.820
 takes about half an hour to three quarters of an hour over the course 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.930
 she has all sorts of press difficulty so start the five 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.970
 metre high 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.870
 and then it is useful or to 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.670
 it is a meter or 10 to 11 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.250
 sometimes it is scary so broke we have it so easier course the us 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.450
 see how it goes 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.050
 mumbai it up slowly 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.160
 with it really gives it but may goldsmith trail son mitchell and 16 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.280
 am not and may not be 6 either 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.490
 before you vote, receive our detailed instruction 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.510
 the explanation should put in the system works 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.260
 shortly before time at a tree 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.440
 attend the state and that platform percent 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 on such a platform what makes those people at the same time 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.360
 the middle 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510
 such a tree also has a waiting list 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 and then you get stuck playing 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 then grab the cabin and they will make something of it 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.090
 Each trail does have one to it that it is very loved is always told 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.669
 where do you have to go from one tree to the other? 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.459
 and thirdly, but always leading in the park we have a jump 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.730
 and no that is in the course the black course and then you are on top of it 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.659
 platform 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.359
 the second tip strings and they go with the second round 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.669
 crucible in her neck feels the sprint in that function and at the same time a role in her neck 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.480
 and that is our sponsors 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.349
 most exciting part and after that you have a kind of swing 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.379
 from one platform to another you swing all stars and so through the trees 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.790
 it is also common for advanced climbers 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.449
 a nice challenge 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.449
 in a packed with people from afp all 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.649
 one there ago 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.499
 I have to speak from my own experience, I think it will work
