weekend<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.210> one's<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.659> bit

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
weekend so this one's a little bit

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.959 
weekend so this one's a little bit
longer<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.469> little<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.860> thicker<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.790> got

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
longer a little bit thicker and it's got

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.749 
longer a little bit thicker and it's got
a<00:02:06.000> pretty<00:02:06.299> little<00:02:06.600> lizard<00:02:07.020> texture<00:02:07.759> retails

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
a pretty little lizard texture retails

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.580 
a pretty little lizard texture retails
for<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.060> thirty<00:02:09.390> eight<00:02:09.690> dollars<00:02:10.229> which<00:02:10.440> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
for about thirty eight dollars which is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.080 
for about thirty eight dollars which is
a<00:02:10.619> little<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:11.069> more<00:02:11.220> expensive

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
a little bit more expensive

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.089 
a little bit more expensive
and<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:12.840> due<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.440> size<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
and I think it's due to the size and the

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.540 
and I think it's due to the size and the
design<00:02:14.849> but<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> absolutely<00:02:15.930> love<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.310> am

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
design but I absolutely love it and I am

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
design but I absolutely love it and I am
planning<00:02:18.269> on<00:02:18.390> probably<00:02:18.989> getting<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.440> other

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
actually very petite friendly this one

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.360 
actually very petite friendly this one
is<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.209> j.crew<00:02:30.690> whip<00:02:31.230> snake<00:02:31.650> leather<00:02:32.010> belt

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it's actually very very skinny much

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
it's actually very very skinny much
skinnier<00:02:35.400> than<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.030> an<00:02:36.180> taylor<00:02:36.629> belts

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
skinnier than all the an taylor belts

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.259 
skinnier than all the an taylor belts
that<00:02:36.959> i<00:02:37.049> have<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:38.040> measures<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.730> seven

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
that i have it measures about seven

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.869 
that i have it measures about seven
sixteenth<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.140> an<00:02:40.260> inch<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> length<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.849> a

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
sixteenth of an inch but the length is a

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.750 
sixteenth of an inch but the length is a
little<00:02:42.269> bit<00:02:42.450> shorter<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.830> this<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.459> measures

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
little bit shorter so this one measures

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.479 
little bit shorter so this one measures
33<00:02:45.390> inches<00:02:45.780> while<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.349> ann<00:02:46.650> taylor<00:02:47.069> perfect

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
33 inches while the ann taylor perfect

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.059 
33 inches while the ann taylor perfect
patent<00:02:47.819> measures<00:02:48.090> about<00:02:48.239> 33<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> half<00:02:49.260> so

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
patent measures about 33 and a half so

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.430 
patent measures about 33 and a half so
no<00:02:50.280> need<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.610> punch<00:02:51.030> extra<00:02:51.540> holes<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.200> one

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
no need to punch extra holes in this one

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.470 
no need to punch extra holes in this one
but<00:02:52.650> i<00:02:53.040> did<00:02:53.310> find<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.940> leather<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
but i did find that the leather is a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
but i did find that the leather is a
little<00:02:54.840> bit<00:02:55.019> cheaper<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.160> start<00:02:56.489> to

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
little bit cheaper when you start to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.280 
little bit cheaper when you start to
bend<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.299> leather<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.629> little<00:02:57.930> bit<00:02:58.110> it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
bend in the leather a little bit it

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.130 
bend in the leather a little bit it
starts<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:58.920> actually<00:02:59.370> fray<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.000> i<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:00.989> that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
starts to actually fray and i think that

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.069 
starts to actually fray and i think that
may<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.650> why<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.099> was<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.849> sale<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.900> the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
may be why it was all on sale so the

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.050 
may be why it was all on sale so the
quality<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.829> leather<00:03:04.980> between<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
quality of the leather between the and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.610 
quality of the leather between the and
taylor<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.569> this<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.079> would<00:03:07.500> definitely

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
taylor and this one I would definitely

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.339 
taylor and this one I would definitely
choose<00:03:08.190> an<00:03:08.489> Taylor<00:03:08.879> for<00:03:09.209> sure<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:10.140> one

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
choose an Taylor for sure this one

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.930 
choose an Taylor for sure this one
