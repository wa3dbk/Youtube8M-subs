00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
 the body found for you 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.420
 the goleador access of course armed the most prominent families of the years 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.949
 80 sterile women 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:10.949
 it's a success so many characters and scenarios and music 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.619
 that's the version of the man you remember know m maybe that's the 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.699
 light 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.939
 is there any balanced 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.409
 yet I am not lyon I will speak to you but rather of the one who has 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.409
 sung in the first two goals there is no doubt 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.319
 let it appear Thursday 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.170
 moussa as you can see it was found and despite its eviction 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.120
 premature generic and speed are still close to the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 series and for good reason Russian 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.040
 crack 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.220
 but the version he was not reached 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.590
 % edited a line concerned however as I told you 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.780
 previously she's in the soap opera so she's still in the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.120
 memories of all ages 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.640
 that necessarily makes you wonder why you were entitled to the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.780
 version of our souls and parcel of truth 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.159
 yet very comfortable with the original language of the cartoon follow 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 Moreover 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.790
 by 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.619
 saying they were up in September decided to make a diversion 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.820
 to understand the term what kind 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.040
 we listen to the cgt who violate make a little effort and it's up to you 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 to sing 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.700
 bocquet stoppers were all like pans are penalized in the voice 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.020
 you necessarily mean something normal it is he who sings all the pieces 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.990
 inside each episode 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.520
 in short the sad story for a team that had to wait 24 years before being 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.900
 finally recognized as the original interpreter 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.610
 today he's performing in parties in the middle of which jean eric 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.210
 will he have gold when asked if he has not passed the age of this kind 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.870
 of song he simply responds 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.329
 we said he's a happy idiot 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.720
 but in what is the role but not with anywhere 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.950
 and then and then if I pass for a fool interpreting some 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.610
 things you 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 wow disappoint at the deposit 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.619
 while the first time 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.069
 I am happy 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.069
 he 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.769
 what you may not know is a petition that already has 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.500
 before explaining 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 you are in 65 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.919
 the law 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.609
 to carcassonne amateur world 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.609
 it's on the slopes not reluctant to this affair 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.879
 clara 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.889
 the White House 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.509
 that's what I'm going to teach you security does not just surf 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.270
 on the popularity of goldorak 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.920
 he lives in the south of France far away from the planet the guys he gets 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.520
 produced with a troupe for a show that decidedly 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 it does not have much to do with the time to do it 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:54.949
 here and then to be well or not in the arm 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.379
 other magnitude than space finally there is always worse
