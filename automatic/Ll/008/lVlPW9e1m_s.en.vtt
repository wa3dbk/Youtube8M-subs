00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.290
 the world of tanks is expanding every day and 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.360
 if earlier to join the universal 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.150
 tank frenzy could only be in 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.810
 mouse and keyboard companies now 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 taking hands gamepad from xbox 360 also 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.600
 possible to tear the metal parts world of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.600
 tanks appeared on 360 box 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.220
 in honor of this event wargaming arranged 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.680
 buffet in Ivan Cafe in Moscow was a lot 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.610
 fun contests with great prizes 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.589
 one of which was the x-box 360 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.510
 musicians and performance of Lord of the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.699
 led by Peter gland well and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.699
 certainly not without official 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.239
 parts to the stage of the cafe went up three important 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.610
 figures 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.220
 the first of which was one of the oldest 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.000
 company employees military consultant 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.000
 Peter Biryukov 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.590
 all remains 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.970
 Is it all the more usual genre 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.160
 fantasy us what 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 confidence will fly away nevertheless 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.440
 company management is what you need 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.260
 do it qualitatively where the right things 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.400
 active original help 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.350
 Basques care where 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.299
 he was soon replaced at the cafe 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.369
 Andrei Kalugin Head 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.350
 Microsoft's entertainment business 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.130
 Russia who told about the successes 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.830
 of the company 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 and also shared the hopes of microsoft on 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:57.750
 the future of the world of tanks on their platform is already 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.259
 more than 10,000 people downloaded 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.820
 the game and the principle of this figure is it 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.679
 well above our initial 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.619
 expectations and is that after 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.900
 how we ran hair when 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.690
 daily seasoning gold subscribers 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.060
 us increased by 50 percent we see 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.819
 that people are willing to pay for quality 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.819
 gel they are ready to play on consoles 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 the last guest on the stage was the game 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.900
 designer studio wargaming west 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.560
 Jeff Greg whom we asked a little later 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.329
 several questions about the game itself 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.670
 two things seemed complicated to us 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.709
 First of all this control we need 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.290
 there was a remake of mouse control and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.570
 keyboard and gamepad 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 2 how much information we need 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.680
 display to the player 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 because unlike computer he sits not 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.560
 close to the monitor 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.470
 and is located a few meters from 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.780
 TV on the visual part and the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.579
 that you must see the hangar card and so 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.100
 then we decided to plant people 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.200
 completely unfamiliar with the game and wanted 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.829
 make sure they understand right away 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.829
 macaw 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.170
 it's my tank and now I Recharging I 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.870
 I think by trial and error we finally 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.940
 made simplicity and accessibility 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.870
 the interface is exactly what is expected from 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.760
 we are the most console players 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.680
 hello jeff my name is arthur very 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.410
 nice to meet you and my first 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 the question was ali hard to move 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.109
 game mechanics when porting a game 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.510
 on xbox 360 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.700
 our engine is called sp. and precisely with 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.430
 using it we created the world of tanks 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 from scratch for xbox 360 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.850
 If you answer shortly, yes it was 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.410
 very hard say management 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.110
 you had to adapt the mouse and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.030
 keyboard which has millions of buttons under 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.790
 simpler management option 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.040
 the same applies to the visual part together 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.410
 with the interface work on all of this 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.660
 demanded a lot of trial and error and 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.120
 tell me if there was any help with 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.810
 side of microsoft when creating a port on 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.690

 how their online services work 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.320
 iron filling x-box 360 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.390
 they gave us tremendous support in 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.970

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.270

 the content of which I still can not alas 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.510
 speak but trust every player 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.350
