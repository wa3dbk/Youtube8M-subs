was going to be a mini mac and I decided

was going to be a mini mac and I decided
to<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.949> metallic<00:00:53.370> silver<00:00:53.760> color

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to go with this metallic silver color

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.430 
to go with this metallic silver color
because<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.420> thought<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.079> with

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
because I thought it would go with

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
because I thought it would go with
almost<00:00:55.770> everything<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.730> would<00:00:57.090> kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.390> go

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
almost everything and would kind of go

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200 
almost everything and would kind of go
into<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.770> spring<00:00:59.070> season<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.699> then<00:00:59.789> go<00:00:59.940> on

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
into the spring season and then go on

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.209 
into the spring season and then go on
into<00:01:00.600> every<00:01:01.050> other<00:01:01.199> season<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.770> well<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
into every other season as well so I

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.410
