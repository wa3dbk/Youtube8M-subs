00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.670 

hey<00:00:05.800> guys<00:00:06.040> how's<00:00:06.220> it<00:00:06.250> going<00:00:06.569> so<00:00:07.569> in<00:00:08.379> my<00:00:08.500> last

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
hey guys how's it going so in my last

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.070 
hey guys how's it going so in my last
video<00:00:08.980> I<00:00:09.040> said<00:00:09.190> that<00:00:09.460> I<00:00:09.490> would<00:00:09.730> have<00:00:10.660> a<00:00:10.690> drawing

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
video I said that I would have a drawing

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.869 
video I said that I would have a drawing
but<00:00:11.770> I<00:00:11.799> just<00:00:12.010> went<00:00:12.190> ahead<00:00:12.250> and<00:00:12.369> skipped<00:00:12.730> that

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
but I just went ahead and skipped that

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.240 
but I just went ahead and skipped that
step<00:00:13.199> because<00:00:14.199> my<00:00:14.469> drawing<00:00:14.770> isn't<00:00:15.010> gonna<00:00:15.100> be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
step because my drawing isn't gonna be

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.130 
step because my drawing isn't gonna be
the<00:00:15.369> same<00:00:15.520> as<00:00:15.670> yours<00:00:15.879> and<00:00:16.150> yours<00:00:16.720> won't<00:00:16.930> be<00:00:17.020> the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
the same as yours and yours won't be the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.120 
the same as yours and yours won't be the
same<00:00:17.320> as<00:00:17.529> anyone<00:00:18.460> elses<00:00:18.760> so<00:00:19.029> I<00:00:19.950> went<00:00:20.950> ahead<00:00:21.010> and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
same as anyone elses so I went ahead and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.200 
same as anyone elses so I went ahead and
started<00:00:21.520> carving<00:00:21.760> I<00:00:22.410> wasn't<00:00:23.410> too<00:00:23.500> happy<00:00:23.530> with

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
started carving I wasn't too happy with

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.440 
started carving I wasn't too happy with
the<00:00:25.210> way<00:00:25.690> it<00:00:25.810> looked<00:00:26.050> but<00:00:27.010> could<00:00:27.940> potentially

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
the way it looked but could potentially

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.790 
the way it looked but could potentially
be<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.600> fact<00:00:28.900> that<00:00:28.990> I'm<00:00:29.170> looking<00:00:29.320> at<00:00:29.560> white

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
be the fact that I'm looking at white

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.410 
be the fact that I'm looking at white
styrofoam<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:31.420> it<00:00:31.630> isn't<00:00:31.810> rocks<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.250> my<00:00:33.460> brain

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
styrofoam and it isn't rocks so my brain

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.580 
styrofoam and it isn't rocks so my brain
is<00:00:34.570> just<00:00:34.600> playing<00:00:34.930> games<00:00:35.110> with<00:00:35.289> me

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
is just playing games with me

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.670 
is just playing games with me
but<00:00:36.160> so<00:00:36.579> basically<00:00:36.910> this<00:00:37.780> isn't<00:00:38.200> all<00:00:38.410> that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
but so basically this isn't all that

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.830 
but so basically this isn't all that
I've<00:00:38.800> carved<00:00:39.070> out<00:00:41.310> it's<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:43.329> is<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> bottom

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
I've carved out it's this is the bottom

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.030 
I've carved out it's this is the bottom
layer<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:47.050> let<00:00:47.200> me<00:00:47.290> just<00:00:47.470> add<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.739> rest<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
layer so let me just add the rest of the

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.580 
layer so let me just add the rest of the
pieces<00:00:48.280> so<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:48.880> get<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.329> idea<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:51.300> here's<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
pieces so you get the idea so here's the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:04.990 
pieces so you get the idea so here's the
next<00:00:53.739> layer<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:58.570> line<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:58.870> up

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.110 

so<00:01:05.690> that's<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> next<00:01:06.080> layer<00:01:09.700> as<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:10.820> can<00:01:10.940> see

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
so that's the next layer as you can see

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.139 
so that's the next layer as you can see
is<00:01:13.330> got<00:01:14.330> caves<00:01:14.660> and<00:01:15.340> cuts<00:01:16.340> of

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:32.219 

grab<00:01:20.109> the<00:01:20.229> next<00:01:20.439> layer<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:31.509> lining<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.929> up<00:01:32.049> as

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
grab the next layer just lining it up as

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:41.130 
grab the next layer just lining it up as
well<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.670> next<00:01:36.850> piece<00:01:39.719> so<00:01:40.719> as<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.990> can

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
well that's the next piece so as you can

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.160 
well that's the next piece so as you can
see<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.909> adds<00:01:43.090> more<00:01:43.359> height

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.360 

the<00:01:48.800> next<00:01:49.070> piece<00:01:50.590> it's<00:01:51.590> gonna<00:01:51.710> go<00:01:51.890> on<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.190> side

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
the next piece it's gonna go on the side

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:13.000 
the next piece it's gonna go on the side
I<00:01:59.170> put<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.290> over<00:02:00.380> here<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:05.800> then<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:11.890> stuck<00:02:12.890> it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
I put it over here and then I stuck it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.110 
I put it over here and then I stuck it
right<00:02:13.040> there<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> jets<00:02:15.890> out<00:02:16.570> clean<00:02:17.570> nicely

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
right there so it jets out clean nicely

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.750 
right there so it jets out clean nicely
so<00:02:21.040> basically<00:02:22.040> if<00:02:22.190> you're<00:02:22.310> wondering<00:02:22.580> why<00:02:22.700> it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
so basically if you're wondering why it

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.199 
so basically if you're wondering why it
looks<00:02:22.970> all<00:02:23.090> burnt<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:24.950> burnt<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.459> use<00:02:26.180> a

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
looks all burnt it is burnt I use a

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.410 
looks all burnt it is burnt I use a
torch<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.800> shape<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.280> make<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.730> hard<00:02:28.940> and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
torch to shape it and make it hard and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.000 
torch to shape it and make it hard and
that<00:02:29.630> helps<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.380> next<00:02:30.620> step<00:02:30.800> which<00:02:30.980> is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that helps for the next step which is

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.220 
that helps for the next step which is
when<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:31.550> apply<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:31.910> cement<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.870> cement

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
when you apply the cement the cement

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.580 
when you apply the cement the cement
will<00:02:33.380> stick<00:02:34.190> better<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.780> styrofoam<00:02:36.410> when

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
will stick better to the styrofoam when

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.640 
will stick better to the styrofoam when
it's<00:02:36.790> cured<00:02:37.790> essentially<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.989> also<00:02:42.200> gives<00:02:42.500> it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's cured essentially it also gives it

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.500 
it's cured essentially it also gives it
a<00:02:42.739> nice<00:02:42.920> hard<00:02:43.780> texture<00:02:44.780> rather<00:02:45.530> than<00:02:45.830> a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
a nice hard texture rather than a

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.150 
a nice hard texture rather than a
semi-hard<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.200> can<00:02:48.380> kind<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.920> push<00:02:49.130> down

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
semi-hard that you can kind of push down

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.979 
semi-hard that you can kind of push down
in<00:02:51.160> which<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:52.850> it<00:02:52.970> comes<00:02:53.120> like<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.700> yeah

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
in which is what it comes like so yeah

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.600 
in which is what it comes like so yeah
so<00:02:56.989> that's<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.200> way<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.410> looks<00:02:57.650> again<00:02:58.400> I'm<00:02:58.580> not

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
so that's the way it looks again I'm not

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.490 
so that's the way it looks again I'm not
super<00:02:59.510> thrilled<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:01.360> but<00:03:02.360> we'll<00:03:03.320> see

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
super thrilled with it but we'll see

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.970 
super thrilled with it but we'll see
what<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.739> looks<00:03:03.769> like<00:03:03.980> when<00:03:04.310> we<00:03:05.019> get<00:03:06.019> some

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
what it looks like when we get some

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.750 
what it looks like when we get some
cement<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:07.700> some<00:03:07.820> paint<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.430> guess

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
cement on it and some paint so I guess

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.509 
cement on it and some paint so I guess
the<00:03:11.420> next<00:03:11.450> video<00:03:11.900> will<00:03:12.110> be<00:03:12.140> me<00:03:12.410> applying<00:03:12.830> the

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
the next video will be me applying the

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.560 
the next video will be me applying the
paint<00:03:16.209> not<00:03:17.209> all<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.510> way<00:03:18.640> it'll<00:03:19.640> just<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.090> like

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
paint not all the way it'll just be like

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.720 
paint not all the way it'll just be like
the<00:03:21.140> first<00:03:21.320> layer<00:03:21.560> like<00:03:21.830> very<00:03:22.430> liquidy<00:03:22.959> and

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
the first layer like very liquidy and

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.190 
the first layer like very liquidy and
actually<00:03:25.730> no<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.940> still<00:03:26.269> have<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.600> attach<00:03:26.750> these

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
actually no I still have to attach these

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.940 
actually no I still have to attach these
pieces<00:03:27.440> with<00:03:27.769> silicone<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.530> that'll<00:03:30.799> be<00:03:30.920> the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
pieces with silicone so that'll be the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.710 
pieces with silicone so that'll be the
next<00:03:31.370> step<00:03:31.700> I'll<00:03:32.510> do<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.010> silicone<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.040> and

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
next step I'll do the silicone and and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:44.339 
next step I'll do the silicone and and
then<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.870> cement<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:38.269> stay<00:03:38.690> tuned<00:03:38.959> for<00:03:39.140> that

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.399 

hey<00:03:45.349> guys<00:03:45.560> how's<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:45.920> going<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:47.290> basically<00:03:48.290> I

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
hey guys how's it going so basically I

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.550 
hey guys how's it going so basically I
just<00:03:48.680> drew<00:03:48.920> lines<00:03:49.609> where<00:03:49.849> I<00:03:49.879> was<00:03:50.060> gonna<00:03:50.150> caulk

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
just drew lines where I was gonna caulk

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.819 
just drew lines where I was gonna caulk
and<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.799> put<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.359> dash<00:03:53.359> here<00:03:53.389> cuz<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:54.379> gets<00:03:54.499> pretty

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
and I put a dash here cuz it gets pretty

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.649 
and I put a dash here cuz it gets pretty
thin<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.609> just<00:03:56.030> didn't<00:03:56.239> want<00:03:56.389> to<00:03:56.450> need<00:03:56.599> a

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
thin so I just didn't want to need a

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.839 
thin so I just didn't want to need a
pore<00:03:56.840> over<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.079> edges<00:03:57.439> so<00:03:57.590> yeah<00:03:58.340> remember<00:03:58.639> to

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
pore over the edges so yeah remember to

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.099 
pore over the edges so yeah remember to
leave<00:03:58.999> some<00:03:59.750> space<00:03:59.870> in<00:04:00.709> between<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.590> edges

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
leave some space in between the edges

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.399 
leave some space in between the edges
also<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:08.569> cement<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.049> you're<00:04:09.169> gonna<00:04:09.260> be

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
also the cement that you're gonna be

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.589 
also the cement that you're gonna be
putting<00:04:09.620> on<00:04:09.799> is<00:04:10.129> gonna<00:04:10.430> hold<00:04:10.639> it<00:04:10.819> as<00:04:11.000> well<00:04:11.389> so

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
putting on is gonna hold it as well so

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.899 
putting on is gonna hold it as well so
if<00:04:12.499> you're<00:04:12.739> worried<00:04:13.010> about<00:04:13.069> this<00:04:13.430> being<00:04:13.639> nice

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
if you're worried about this being nice

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.170 
if you're worried about this being nice
weak<00:04:14.870> layers<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:16.250> mint<00:04:16.519> should<00:04:17.709> help<00:04:18.709> its

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
weak layers this mint should help its

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.070 
weak layers this mint should help its
structural<00:04:20.180> integrity<00:04:20.479> as<00:04:21.289> a<00:04:21.949> whole<00:04:23.080> and

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
structural integrity as a whole and

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.050 
structural integrity as a whole and
basically<00:04:24.440> that's<00:04:24.800> just<00:04:25.039> what<00:04:25.849> you're<00:04:25.940> gonna

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
basically that's just what you're gonna

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
basically that's just what you're gonna
do<00:04:26.270> you're<00:04:26.419> gonna<00:04:26.509> take<00:04:26.750> your<00:04:28.900> caulking<00:04:29.900> gun

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
do you're gonna take your caulking gun

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.520 
do you're gonna take your caulking gun

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
and just go along the lines just like

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.920 
and just go along the lines just like
that<00:04:36.770> and<00:04:37.150> then<00:04:38.150> make<00:04:38.360> sure<00:04:38.389> when<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.720> set<00:04:38.900> it

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
that and then make sure when you set it

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.140 
that and then make sure when you set it

for watching and stay tuned for the next

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.830 
for watching and stay tuned for the next

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
step which is probably more fun than

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.960 
step which is probably more fun than
this
