00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.530 

in<00:00:01.630> this<00:00:01.869> video<00:00:02.200> we're<00:00:02.500> going<00:00:02.680> to<00:00:02.920> talk<00:00:03.160> about

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
in this video we're going to talk about

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.810 
in this video we're going to talk about
lapping<00:00:04.540> rebar<00:00:05.290> and<00:00:05.530> what<00:00:06.130> the<00:00:06.340> basic

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:06.820 
lapping rebar and what the basic

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.900 
lapping rebar and what the basic
requirements<00:00:07.570> of<00:00:07.690> that<00:00:07.779> actually<00:00:08.769> are<00:00:09.129> the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
requirements of that actually are the

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.140 
requirements of that actually are the
black<00:00:10.119> arrow<00:00:10.389> is<00:00:10.660> pointing<00:00:11.110> to<00:00:11.490> two<00:00:12.490> pieces<00:00:12.969> of

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
black arrow is pointing to two pieces of

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
black arrow is pointing to two pieces of
rebar<00:00:13.360> one<00:00:14.049> that<00:00:14.530> was<00:00:14.799> dialed<00:00:15.339> into<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
rebar one that was dialed into the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.999 
rebar one that was dialed into the
foundation<00:00:17.920> of<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.460> existing<00:00:18.939> house<00:00:19.210> and<00:00:20.009> the

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
foundation of the existing house and the

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.380 
foundation of the existing house and the
other<00:00:21.189> which<00:00:21.759> runs<00:00:22.210> across<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.529> new<00:00:23.980> concrete

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
other which runs across the new concrete

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.509 
other which runs across the new concrete
foundation<00:00:25.390> for<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.900> room<00:00:26.080> addition<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.859> we

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
foundation for the room addition that we

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.470 
foundation for the room addition that we
were<00:00:27.640> working<00:00:28.029> on<00:00:28.210> now<00:00:29.199> a<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.550> correct<00:00:31.179> lap

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
were working on now a the correct lap

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.180 
were working on now a the correct lap
distance<00:00:32.440> of<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.860> lap<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:35.170> two<00:00:35.740> pieces<00:00:36.160> of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
distance of the lap for two pieces of

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.730 
distance of the lap for two pieces of
rebar<00:00:36.520> is<00:00:37.380> 40<00:00:38.380> times<00:00:38.880> the<00:00:39.880> diameter<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.840> the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
rebar is 40 times the diameter of the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
rebar is 40 times the diameter of the
rebar<00:00:42.100> so<00:00:42.760> in<00:00:43.030> this<00:00:43.270> case<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.710> rebar<00:00:45.520> is<00:00:45.730> a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
rebar so in this case the rebar is a

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.590 
rebar so in this case the rebar is a
number<00:00:46.360> four<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:47.080> a<00:00:47.890> number<00:00:48.130> four<00:00:48.550> has<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:48.880> 1/2

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
number four and a number four has a 1/2

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.330 
number four and a number four has a 1/2
inch<00:00:50.010> diameter<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.790> if<00:00:51.910> we<00:00:52.060> multiply<00:00:52.530> 40<00:00:53.530> times

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
inch diameter so if we multiply 40 times

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.030 
inch diameter so if we multiply 40 times
0.5<00:00:55.270> or<00:00:56.100> 40<00:00:57.100> times<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:58.750> half<00:00:59.020> of<00:00:59.290> an<00:00:59.440> inch<00:00:59.590> we

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
0.5 or 40 times one half of an inch we

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.510 
0.5 or 40 times one half of an inch we
will<00:01:00.280> get<00:01:00.460> 20<00:01:00.910> inches<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:02.470> rebar<00:01:02.950> needs<00:01:03.280> to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
will get 20 inches so the rebar needs to

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.690 
will get 20 inches so the rebar needs to
lap<00:01:03.790> a<00:01:04.059> minimum<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.230> 20<00:01:05.980> inches<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:07.630> order<00:01:07.990> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
lap a minimum of 20 inches in order to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.280 
lap a minimum of 20 inches in order to
have<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.060> correct<00:01:11.040> distance<00:01:12.040> there<00:01:12.520> now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
have the correct distance there now

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.230 
have the correct distance there now
just<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.770> give<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.070> better<00:01:15.280> idea<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:16.150> know

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
just to give you a better idea you know

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.790 
just to give you a better idea you know
I<00:01:16.270> went<00:01:16.450> with<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.600> 1/2<00:01:16.840> inch<00:01:17.110> let's<00:01:17.560> just

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
I went with a 1/2 inch let's just

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.070 
I went with a 1/2 inch let's just
pretend<00:01:17.980> like<00:01:18.220> we<00:01:18.490> were<00:01:18.610> using<00:01:18.850> 1-inch<00:01:19.570> rebar

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
pretend like we were using 1-inch rebar

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.510 
pretend like we were using 1-inch rebar
this<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.650> simpler<00:01:21.640> if<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:23.080> had<00:01:23.409> two<00:01:23.980> pieces<00:01:24.280> of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
this is simpler if we had two pieces of

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.840 
this is simpler if we had two pieces of
one-inch<00:01:25.000> rebar<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.780> we<00:01:25.960> needed<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.320> lap<00:01:26.850> we

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
one-inch rebar that we needed to lap we

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.690 
one-inch rebar that we needed to lap we
would<00:01:28.180> multiply<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:29.440> diameter<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.370> rebar

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
would multiply the diameter of the rebar

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.469 
would multiply the diameter of the rebar
which<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.479> one<00:01:31.810> one<00:01:32.560> inch<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:34.390> would

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
which is one one inch and we would

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.080 
which is one one inch and we would
multiply<00:01:34.659> that<00:01:35.229> by<00:01:35.290> 40<00:01:36.100> which<00:01:36.580> would<00:01:36.850> give<00:01:37.060> us

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
multiply that by 40 which would give us

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.590 
multiply that by 40 which would give us
40<00:01:38.050> inches<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:39.430> we<00:01:39.610> would<00:01:39.729> actually<00:01:40.150> need<00:01:40.330> to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
40 inches so we would actually need to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.830 
40 inches so we would actually need to
lap<00:01:40.840> a<00:01:41.110> one-inch<00:01:41.800> piece<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.250> rebar<00:01:42.460> 40<00:01:43.360> inches

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
lap a one-inch piece of rebar 40 inches

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.460 
lap a one-inch piece of rebar 40 inches
now<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.860> large<00:01:45.340> lap<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.990> again<00:01:47.320> that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
now that is a large lap so again that

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.110 
now that is a large lap so again that
should<00:01:47.620> give<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.920> an<00:01:48.010> idea<00:01:48.430> if<00:01:48.820> you're<00:01:49.060> ever

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
should give you an idea if you're ever

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.690 
should give you an idea if you're ever
going<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.479> do<00:01:49.659> any<00:01:49.960> concrete<00:01:50.920> work

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
going to do any concrete work

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.940 
going to do any concrete work
foundations<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.409> then<00:01:53.590> make<00:01:53.770> sure<00:01:53.799> that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
foundations and then make sure that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.090 
foundations and then make sure that
they're<00:01:54.280> tight<00:01:54.520> off<00:01:54.820> good<00:01:55.440> now<00:01:56.440> another<00:01:57.010> thing

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
they're tight off good now another thing

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.640 
they're tight off good now another thing
I<00:01:57.460> would<00:01:57.520> like<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.790> point<00:01:58.150> out<00:01:58.420> is<00:01:58.720> this<00:01:59.260> might

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
I would like to point out is this might

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.800 
I would like to point out is this might
not<00:01:59.680> be<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.310> case<00:02:00.520> all<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.970> time<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.750> should

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
not be the case all the time you should

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.219 
not be the case all the time you should
always<00:02:02.260> check<00:02:02.470> with<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.670> structural<00:02:04.570> engineer

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
always check with a structural engineer

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.260 
always check with a structural engineer
your<00:02:05.590> building<00:02:05.950> department<00:02:06.490> or<00:02:06.670> someone<00:02:07.090> else

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
your building department or someone else

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.089 
your building department or someone else
I'm<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.570> trying<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.110> give<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.529> a<00:02:08.560> general

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
I'm just trying to give you a general

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.110 
I'm just trying to give you a general
idea<00:02:09.549> of<00:02:10.119> what<00:02:11.079> is<00:02:11.889> standard<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
idea of what is standard in the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.049 
idea of what is standard in the
ruction<00:02:13.450> industry
