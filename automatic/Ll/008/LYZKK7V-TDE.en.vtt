00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.090 
go over kind of more of the fine detail
so<00:01:42.150> there's<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.899> pango<00:01:43.350> that's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.649> black<00:01:43.860> one

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
so there's the pango that's a black one

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
so there's the pango that's a black one
which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.369> real<00:01:44.850> nice<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.899> poro<00:01:46.259> which<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
which is real nice the poro which is

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.730 
which is real nice the poro which is
purple<00:01:47.189> really<00:01:47.939> pops<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> last<00:01:49.470> one

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
forty nine dollars so let's work with

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.740 
forty nine dollars so let's work with
the<00:02:01.159> remu<00:02:02.159> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> red<00:02:02.880> color<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.659> I'm

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the remu which is the red color so I'm

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
the remu which is the red color so I'm
going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.680> slide<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
going to get that in here and slide the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
going to get that in here and slide the
other<00:02:05.189> ones<00:02:05.369> out<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> way<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> bring<00:02:06.930> in

other ones out of the way and bring in
my<00:02:07.380> iPad<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.759> get<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> into<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> case

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
my iPad so we can get it into the case

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050 
my iPad so we can get it into the case
itself<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.590> put<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.459> secure<00:02:11.940> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
itself now to put this in you secure the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.190 
itself now to put this in you secure the
two<00:02:12.390> corners<00:02:12.810> for

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
two corners for

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.660 
two corners for
first<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.530> will<00:02:13.950> tell<00:02:14.129> you<00:02:14.220> right<00:02:14.250> off<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> bat

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
first I will tell you right off the bat

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.059 
first I will tell you right off the bat
that<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.180> chassis<00:02:16.020> system<00:02:16.200> does<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:16.890> work

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
that this chassis system does not work

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.860 
that this chassis system does not work
great<00:02:17.610> with<00:02:17.730> screen<00:02:18.030> shields<00:02:18.450> hopefully<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
great with screen shields hopefully you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.600 
great with screen shields hopefully you
can<00:02:18.959> make<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.230> out<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.379> it's<00:02:19.950> bubbling<00:02:20.459> my

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
can make it out that it's bubbling my

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.070 
can make it out that it's bubbling my
screen<00:02:20.910> shield<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> corner<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.989> will

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
screen shield in the corner and it will

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.780 
screen shield in the corner and it will
do<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.379> on<00:02:22.560> most<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> corners<00:02:23.370> because

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
do that on most of the corners because

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.600 
do that on most of the corners because
it's<00:02:24.090> very<00:02:24.239> tight<00:02:24.599> now<00:02:24.870> Meru<00:02:25.620> actually<00:02:25.920> did

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
it's very tight now Meru actually did

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670 
it's very tight now Meru actually did
that<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.910> purpose<00:02:26.959> they<00:02:27.959> felt<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.319> they<00:02:28.620> were

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
that on purpose they felt like they were

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.530 
that on purpose they felt like they were
better<00:02:28.920> off<00:02:29.040> with<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> tighter<00:02:29.760> chassis<00:02:30.330> system

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
better off with a tighter chassis system

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
better off with a tighter chassis system
which<00:02:30.900> would<00:02:31.080> secure<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.739> iPad<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.370> there<00:02:32.550> as

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
which would secure the iPad in there as

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.640 
which would secure the iPad in there as
opposed<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> loser<00:02:33.599> one<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.080> again<00:02:34.500> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
opposed to a loser one and again that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050 
opposed to a loser one and again that
tighter<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.130> does<00:02:35.340> seem<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.580> want<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.940> mess

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
tighter one does seem to want to mess

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.699 
tighter one does seem to want to mess
with<00:02:36.269> screen<00:02:36.540> shields<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:36.989> you're<00:02:37.380> careful

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
with screen shields if you're careful

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.589 
with screen shields if you're careful
you<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.000> there<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.480> it

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
you can get it in there so that it

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.120 
you can get it in there so that it
doesn't<00:02:39.750> really<00:02:39.959> affect<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.500> overall<00:02:40.530> usage

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
doesn't really affect the overall usage

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.309 
doesn't really affect the overall usage
you<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:42.030> kind<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.269> have<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.690> real<00:02:42.989> careful

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
you just kind of have to be real careful

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.190 
you just kind of have to be real careful
when<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.069> go<00:02:44.099> about<00:02:44.489> doing<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.599> it's<00:02:46.110> going

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
when you go about doing so so it's going

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.809 
when you go about doing so so it's going
to<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.620> force<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.220> into<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.640> other

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
to kind of force this into the other

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.420 
to kind of force this into the other
corners<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.470> get<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.709> all<00:02:49.799> secure<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
corners and then get it all secure and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.089 
corners and then get it all secure and
you'll<00:02:50.549> see<00:02:50.790> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.480> what<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.660> mean<00:02:51.959> as<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.260> get

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
you'll see kind of what I mean as I get

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.710 
you'll see kind of what I mean as I get
it<00:02:53.130> all<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.519> there<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> last

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it all in there so there's the last

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.050 
it all in there so there's the last
corner<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.340> bubbling<00:02:56.579> really

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
corner so you can see it bubbling really

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
corner so you can see it bubbling really
bad<00:02:57.239> up<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.870> corner<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.890> kind<00:02:59.099> of

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
bad up in that corner if I kind of

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.550 
bad up in that corner if I kind of
release<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.150> do<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.930> again<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.500> just

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
release this and do it again and just

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.900 
release this and do it again and just
make<00:03:01.769> sure<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> screen<00:03:02.760> shield

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
make sure that I get the screen shield

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.289 
make sure that I get the screen shield
under<00:03:03.329> there<00:03:04.190> most<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.400> time<00:03:05.489> I'm<00:03:05.910> able<00:03:06.090> to

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
under there most of the time I'm able to

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.479 
under there most of the time I'm able to
kind<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.569> push<00:03:07.019> out<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.319> bubble<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
kind of push out the bubble like so and

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.850 
kind of push out the bubble like so and
it<00:03:09.329> works<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.660> fine<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.290> although<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.769> a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
it works just fine so although it's a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.530 
it works just fine so although it's a
little<00:03:10.890> bubble<00:03:11.340> under<00:03:11.459> there<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.819> hidden<00:03:12.239> by

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
right corner of the chassis I should say

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.250 
right corner of the chassis I should say
and<00:05:00.380> that<00:05:01.220> does<00:05:01.490> sometimes<00:05:01.940> affect<00:05:02.540> usage<00:05:03.020> I

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
and that does sometimes affect usage I

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.140 
and that does sometimes affect usage I
would<00:05:03.710> notice<00:05:04.040> once<00:05:04.280> in<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.460> while<00:05:04.640> that<00:05:04.669> the

ipad<00:05:05.360> would<00:05:05.750> actually<00:05:06.110> start<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.710> turn<00:05:06.950> off

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
ipad would actually start to turn off

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.430 
ipad would actually start to turn off
maybe<00:05:07.520> from<00:05:07.790> pressure<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.360> this<00:05:08.570> pressing<00:05:09.290> on

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
maybe from pressure of this pressing on

off but and it was wasn't a major
nuisance<00:05:15.980> but<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.430> did<00:05:16.610> see<00:05:16.790> it<00:05:16.880> happening<00:05:17.300> once

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
nuisance but I did see it happening once

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.140 
nuisance but I did see it happening once
in<00:05:18.080> a<00:05:18.229> while<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:19.220> also<00:05:19.400> makes<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.850> little<00:05:20.060> bit

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
in a while it also makes a little bit

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.270 
in a while it also makes a little bit
more<00:05:20.300> difficult<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.780> access<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.740> button<00:05:22.160> now

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
more difficult to access that button now

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.980 
more difficult to access that button now
when<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.460> reached<00:05:22.700> out<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:22.940> Meru<00:05:23.419> their

response to that was that most people

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.210 
response to that was that most people
don't<00:05:25.790> use<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.270> button<00:05:26.660> because<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.770> cases

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
don't use that button because the cases

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.219 
don't use that button because the cases
