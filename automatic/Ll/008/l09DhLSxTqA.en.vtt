00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 king of the river 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:26.910
 Call me that we've stopped being a demon. 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.800
 plays with the helpless and 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.690

 entirely in play so hot is a 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.260
 monstrosity tank with attributes and 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.360
 enough to stay on the route 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.460
 soil or as support 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.229
 after choosing its function it uses 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:06.220
 its imposing size to swallow 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:08.380
 enemies and load allies on the map to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.540
 passive of so hot is a taste 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.700
 acquired it applies accumulation of its 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.530
 passive on enemy champions that hit 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.079
 with basic attacks or skills 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.909
 damage when it applies 3 good builds it 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.159
 can do things with them soon 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.930
 we'll get there so hot you can apply 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.880
 accumulates the liabilities in several targets to the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.710
 same time they fall after some 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.619
 seconds 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.350
 Let's start with his devouring because he 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.420
 interacts with other skills as 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.979
 hot swallows a nearby target and kospi 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.810
 after a few seconds 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.580
 besides the general rule the ability is 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.880
 behave differently depending on the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.420
 who or what he eats first 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.370
 enemy troops and monsters 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.409
 after devouring a tank can spit 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.570
 back causing an amount of damage 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.770
 magical to what you devoured and in the area of ​​action 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.840
 from whom 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.940
 although it is so hot to be able to eat 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.119
 handful of monsters he can not devour 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.830
 all of them apparently the Dragon Baron 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.090
 blue and red are too large for 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.580
 fit in your stomach 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.549
 the environment can devour allied champions 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.250
 also when they do they leave the target 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.810
 once in your belly 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.670
 while so hot with a friend 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.439
 in the dance its speed of movement 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.269
 increases but only when you move in the 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.430
 direction of enemy champions 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.409
 after a few seconds hot weather or your 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 can choose when they left the 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.849
 the mouth of the big guy and when the drivers 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.129
 are thrown at a distance 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.810
 finally also warm can also 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.090
 devour enemy champions 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.879
 there is a condition he can only do it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.440
 after you have accumulated an acquired taste 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.780
 as soon as you finish chewing 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.910
 so hot can regurgitate your mouth anything 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 in the target direction causing it to suffer 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.900
 damage based on the percentage of life plus 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.090
 when they are with the accumulations 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.070
 devouring them drastically reduces your vision 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.210
 and makes them unwelcome 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.280
 for a few seconds 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.050
 How much time do we get so heavy? 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.390
 that its speed of movement is very 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.130
 reduced 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.080
 use delay to bring your allies 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.150
 Front line to fight you'll get there 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.100
 thanks to the speed bonus of 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.960
 movement and after the pilots they 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.070
 were well positioned to reach the 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.440
 enemies and I left limping what so 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.510
 hot is tongue whip it shoots a 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.580
 accuracy shot from moment to moment 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.860
 language that causes damage and slowness in 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.540
 first target hit however if he 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.670
 be able to maximize its accumulations of 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.740
 passive in an enemy language champion is the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.960
 whip stun your delicious target 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.150
 tongue whip can also increase the 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.010
 reach of devouring troops and monsters 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.780
 hitting to devour before proceeding with 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.870
 tongue whip so hot and puts them 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.910
 in the mouth whip tongue has a time of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.590
 recharge short and long range then use 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.720
 often to cause slowness in the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.720
 unless you join accumulations of your liabilities 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.690
 the hot notice has effect the liabilities and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.820
 passively active thick skin 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.709
 transforms all damage received by than 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.050
 hot in gray life that he 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.970
 partially converts into real life 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.310
 a few seconds after you leave 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.500
 combat when warm weather activates skin 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.870
 thick it converts all life yes it has 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.790
 a shield that quickly decays notice that 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.060
 So many people can not create gray life. 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.410
 When skill is scribbled 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.180
 use thick skin to increase 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.769
 temporarily its tank side when 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.390
 diving into the towers or 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.390
 leading to a lot of constant noise 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.750
 finally the ultimate warm weather is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.240
