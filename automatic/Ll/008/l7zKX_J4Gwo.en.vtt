00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.519
 am assistant medical doctor 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.380
 clinic 4 do a political here 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.619
 is the clinic for hematology oncology 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.840
 hematology and stem cell transplantation 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.750
 i work here since february last 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.880
 year as an assistant doctor after I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.270
 several years in the us as postdoc 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.270
 had 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.410
 i was not born in germany i 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.120
 I am here to Germany as a child 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.559
 I 've got it as a task 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.329
 somewhere we see as the doctor 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.940
 Patients would also help 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.960
 a personal story though that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.719
 my father had stomach cancer he had 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.739
 But luckily that was the way it was 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.460
 could cure that he cured of it 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.170
 can be 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.210
 but not everyone was lucky 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.539
 Patients I see that as mine 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.009
 personal task to try here 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.990
 so clinically as well as also 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.920
 scientifically the therapy of this 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.920
 leave patients 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.009
 I work on the so-called blood cancer 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.560
 when there is leukemia 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.420
 we have quite some progress 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.119
 certainly in the last ten years in 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 The treatment of leukemia made that 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.539
 problem is always that 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.700
 recurrence of docking today 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.700
 which I pull fashion era here or too 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.860
 the targeted therapies are unfortunately 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.130
 unable or insufficient 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.430
 capable of these leukemic stem cells 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.840
 get rid 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.080
 Patients always get that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.210
 again gatti had what I do now 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.090
 would like to be here in germany with 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.460
 the help of the as a young price is mine 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.860
 then actually look how it looks 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.080
 I am from leukemic stem cells 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.020
 of course I hope for how many researchers 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.819
 that I find a way through it 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.409
 re-occur and the treatment of 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.409
 to improve blood cancer patients 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.159
 Herk Arabi is crazy 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.599
 dedicated employee and it is too 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.629
 someone who does not let up 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.890
 he is so sure he is one 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.860
 fundamental curiosity I believe 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.480
 you absolutely need that as the clinic 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.560
 doctor anyway but as a researcher 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.790
 especially and all of them 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.599
 questions about total 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.099
 Open-minded shows the advantage as 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.329
 a clinician is i see for example 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.620
 sometimes very deep in the 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.260
 molecular genetics of a sick turnover 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.650
 researcher it is so that I look then 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.780
 can 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.209
 makes this clinically sensible than ever 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.950
 me in the petrischale or just with the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.319
 maus macher So this has a clinical 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.500
 relevance because at the end of the day it is 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.659
 so i can have the best ideas 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.280
 It must be scientific work 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.569
 make sense for the patient as well 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.569
 I also hold my order 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 So the serious young price means for 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.120
 me that I am really more now 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.400
 time can really take order in the lab 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.900
 significantly increased to work really 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.629
 to build my lab 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.260
 my staff to train it is 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.470
 an extreme relief what I like 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.599
 at my hospital so the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.629
 Medical clinic 4 is we have one 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.450
 very collegial relationship men the 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.410
 friendly 2 it is really very 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.989
 family 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.200
 but that also makes it possible with you 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.920
 the stress situation in team ico much 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.920
 to handle better 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.780
 So sometimes I see that in how 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.280
 i am going to a patient whom 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.470
 I do not even treat it at the moment 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.560
 Oh yes, you are Mr. Karubi of if 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.110
 It's young and that's what it does 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.650
 Patients proud because they say so 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.450
 is someone really active in it 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.200
 may work for me or others 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.450
 to help people 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.720
 that's what really gives me the energy 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.720
 gives
