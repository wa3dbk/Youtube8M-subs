00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.180
 when football ends there will be 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:16.760
 I lived accountant australia because I fought 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:20.030
 he wanted to go because there are toys because there 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.980
 toys to follow because I like 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.619
 australia had been in 93 with the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.140
 selection had already seen something beautiful and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.509
 well I said when I leave 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.140
 been us in qatar and we wanted that 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.700
 the boys follow a little with english 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 that you do not cut these two years of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 experience and so they followed us 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.540
 also because good they grab 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.540
 much faster to us 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.910
 It cost a little more and good to taste not 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.680
 it was just the English base and well I say 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 that australia was perfect and that's why 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.800
 We decided that geniuses of or speak English 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.719

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.899

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:13.229
 difficult from very difficult and pretty 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.170
 little kid until he was two years old 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.020

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.690
 the rings of an organization a respect 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 loving something so advised anyone in 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.710
 serious yes at least to see how it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.000
 can live without doing things 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.250
 extravagant 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.400
 in a quiet way, it is fabulous if the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.880
 part the security part and you can 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.880
 where everything works everything I think 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.280
 we are the living 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.700
 we all know they do not improve because 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700
 justly 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:10.200
 for that I think we have two 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.120
 hands legs an absolute head 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.879

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:31.970

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.970
