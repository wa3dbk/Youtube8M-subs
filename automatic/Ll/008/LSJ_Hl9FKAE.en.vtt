00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:09.370
 distracted introduces itself magnificently 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.370
 and that would be a world, of course 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.830
 makes in the first six minutes already 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.830
 more swirls than maxime 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.980
 you will notice that here at events as well 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.670
 is now a right on 14 players 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.660
 become 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:32.110
 the second 45 minutes from no time 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.090
 So in the middle of May 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.910
 and good luck for the stuttgarter in 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 the middle was successful 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.760
 there is the purchase and it is no longer possible 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.489
 at every choice of swan and summer 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.040
 harnik and cacau fly in there and that 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 was lucky for the Bulgarians and now 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.180
 the change 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.120
 in adelaide 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.730
 not given red is not given 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.150
 program applies to the defender 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:23.570
 stock of nz and the group about harnik 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:26.670
 involved of course the slow motion could 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 have been off 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 Of course, that was not the case at the first moment 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.820
 he can follow suit in gent correctly 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
 not seen the number 7 whether madoff 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.190
 but chair of the Macedonian 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.950
 defender of the most expensive and 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:47.790
 because well done because there it is 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.790
 has condition 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.020
 that's what he's doing now 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.020
 outside 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.770
 all good 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.959
 too reckless the counter 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.500
 the bi steps nicely into the run of 3 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.530
 those are the situations the 7100 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.530
 stuttgarter fans 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.150
 just under two minutes left 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.150
 cacau helps 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.480
 no foul so no case cacau 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.520
 the pe stepped 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.620
 that's an exciting story 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.340
 how can that happen seconds ago 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.290
 finish this monster chance with pedro 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.290
 completely friday massive 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.769
 happy points 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:59.450
 and shares that and hits 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.450
