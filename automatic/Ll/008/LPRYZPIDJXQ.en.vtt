we got the are sponsored shield guess
which<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> is

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.010 

this<00:00:30.850> yield<00:00:31.090> is<00:00:31.240> going<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.510> be<00:00:31.600> eventually

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
this yield is going to be eventually

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.600 
this yield is going to be eventually
converted<00:00:32.320> into<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.619> kite<00:00:32.860> shield<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:33.340> so<00:00:33.460> will

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
converted into a kite shield and so will

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.950 
converted into a kite shield and so will
that<00:00:33.760> one<00:00:33.970> thing<00:00:34.420> it's<00:00:34.570> how<00:00:34.630> we're<00:00:34.810> going<00:00:34.900> to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
that one thing it's how we're going to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.540 
that one thing it's how we're going to
be<00:00:35.050> working<00:00:35.230> with<00:00:35.410> mostly<00:00:35.650> just<00:00:35.890> long<00:00:36.100> swords

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
be working with mostly just long swords

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.380 
be working with mostly just long swords
and<00:00:36.700> stuff<00:00:36.850> like<00:00:36.970> that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
and stuff like that

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.330 
and stuff like that
if<00:00:37.660> using<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.050> lot<00:00:38.200> of<00:00:38.260> specialty<00:00:38.680> weapons<00:00:39.130> and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
if using a lot of specialty weapons and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.510 
if using a lot of specialty weapons and
most<00:00:39.790> of<00:00:39.880> them<00:00:40.030> are<00:00:40.120> beginning<00:00:40.950> trashed<00:00:41.950> or

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
most of them are beginning trashed or

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880 
most of them are beginning trashed or
destroyed<00:00:43.060> so<00:00:43.600> we're<00:00:44.110> going<00:00:44.200> to<00:00:44.260> just<00:00:44.500> try<00:00:44.860> to

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
destroyed so we're going to just try to

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.070 
destroyed so we're going to just try to
make<00:00:45.130> normal<00:00:45.940> swords<00:00:46.390> get<00:00:46.570> through<00:00:46.720> practice

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
make normal swords get through practice

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.270 
make normal swords get through practice
stuff<00:00:47.290> like<00:00:47.440> that<00:00:47.590> and<00:00:47.739> use<00:00:47.830> specialty

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
stuff like that and use specialty

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.979 
stuff like that and use specialty
weapons<00:00:48.670> once<00:00:48.880> we<00:00:49.000> actually<00:00:49.270> go<00:00:49.809> out<00:00:49.960> to

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
weapons once we actually go out to

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.520 
weapons once we actually go out to
compete<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:52.239> will<00:00:52.629> still<00:00:52.900> be<00:00:53.050> probably

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
compete which will still be probably

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.640 
compete which will still be probably
like<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.800> year<00:00:54.100> from<00:00:54.190> now<00:00:54.280> but<00:00:55.470> meanwhile<00:00:56.470> we're

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
like a year from now but meanwhile we're

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.650 
like a year from now but meanwhile we're
working<00:00:56.920> on<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.190> at<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.400> point<00:00:57.610> I'm<00:00:57.879> now<00:00:58.510> on

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
working on it at this point I'm now on

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.869 
working on it at this point I'm now on
to<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.870> weapons<00:00:59.230> we<00:01:00.010> have<00:01:00.070> two<00:01:00.340> accidents

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
the same time all the more dangerous and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.930 
the same time all the more dangerous and
we<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:17.560> our<00:01:17.770> little<00:01:17.950> throwing<00:01:18.340> dagger<00:01:18.580> and
