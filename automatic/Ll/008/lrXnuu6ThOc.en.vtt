00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
so now let's talk about putting all of

so now let's talk about putting all of
these<00:00:11.510> things<00:00:11.809> together<00:00:12.020> so<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.490> first

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
these things together so the first

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.040 
these things together so the first
element<00:00:13.910> we<00:00:14.210> talked<00:00:14.480> about<00:00:14.630> first

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
element we talked about first

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.460 
element we talked about first
fundamental<00:00:15.349> was<00:00:15.890> swing<00:00:16.460> and<00:00:17.020> then<00:00:18.020> we<00:00:18.349> went

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
fundamental was swing and then we went

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.600 
fundamental was swing and then we went
through<00:00:18.710> the<00:00:18.800> other<00:00:18.890> two<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:19.310> then<00:00:19.400> we<00:00:19.460> talked

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
through the other two and then we talked

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.630 
through the other two and then we talked
about<00:00:19.640> posture<00:00:20.240> so<00:00:20.960> let's<00:00:21.950> try<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.250> put<00:00:22.400> swing

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
about posture so let's try and put swing

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.190 
about posture so let's try and put swing
and<00:00:22.820> posture<00:00:23.180> together<00:00:23.509> what<00:00:23.720> do<00:00:23.779> we<00:00:23.869> need<00:00:24.020> to

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
and posture together what do we need to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.380 
and posture together what do we need to
do<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.860> incorporate<00:00:25.340> those<00:00:25.489> two<00:00:25.820> together

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
do to incorporate those two together

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.630 
do to incorporate those two together
okay<00:00:26.750> so<00:00:27.259> just<00:00:27.710> we've<00:00:28.009> talked<00:00:28.279> about<00:00:28.399> our

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
okay so just we've talked about our

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.460 
okay so just we've talked about our
posture<00:00:28.880> having<00:00:29.390> our<00:00:29.509> centers<00:00:29.869> lined<00:00:30.079> up<00:00:30.259> to

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
posture having our centers lined up to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.080 
posture having our centers lined up to
get<00:00:30.619> our<00:00:30.739> common<00:00:31.070> center<00:00:31.460> like<00:00:31.640> nice<00:00:31.849> and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
get our common center like nice and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.360 
get our common center like nice and
strong<00:00:32.450> which<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.200> maintained<00:00:33.649> all<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.100> time

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
strong which is maintained all the time

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.910 
strong which is maintained all the time
now<00:00:35.090> we're<00:00:35.540> trying<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.930> swing<00:00:36.230> as<00:00:36.440> well<00:00:36.620> so

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
now we're trying to swing as well so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.560 
now we're trying to swing as well so
we're<00:00:37.040> trying<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.309> get<00:00:37.430> maximum<00:00:38.000> movement

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
we're trying to get maximum movement

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.050 
we're trying to get maximum movement
across<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:39.020> floor<00:00:39.260> without<00:00:40.010> sacrificing<00:00:40.940> our

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
across the floor without sacrificing our

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.250 
across the floor without sacrificing our
posture<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:41.630> you<00:00:41.690> don't<00:00:41.900> want<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.080> be<00:00:42.170> getting

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
posture so you don't want to be getting

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.650 
posture so you don't want to be getting
maximum<00:00:42.710> Drive<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.490> like<00:00:44.030> distorting<00:00:44.630> your

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
maximum Drive and like distorting your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.120 
maximum Drive and like distorting your
frame<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:45.050> your<00:00:45.260> posture<00:00:45.530> as<00:00:45.830> you're<00:00:46.010> doing

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
frame and your posture as you're doing

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.850 
frame and your posture as you're doing

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
that that was your maximum try that was

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.020 
that that was your maximum try that was
my<00:00:49.010> bad<00:00:49.190> as<00:00:49.340> posture<00:00:49.700> though<00:00:50.080> okay<00:00:51.080> so<00:00:51.650> now

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
my bad as posture though okay so now

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.970 
my bad as posture though okay so now
when<00:00:53.030> we're<00:00:53.210> swinging<00:00:53.540> we're<00:00:54.230> lowering<00:00:54.830> and

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
when we're swinging we're lowering and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.040 
when we're swinging we're lowering and
underneath<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.210> center<00:00:56.390> of<00:00:56.570> gravity<00:00:56.690> is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
underneath the center of gravity is

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.660 
underneath the center of gravity is
where<00:00:57.200> we<00:00:57.320> talked<00:00:57.530> about<00:00:57.650> things<00:00:57.980> lowering<00:00:58.490> so

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
where we talked about things lowering so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.790 
where we talked about things lowering so
as<00:00:58.820> we're<00:00:59.030> lowering<00:00:59.360> we're<00:01:00.140> bending<00:01:00.410> through

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
as we're lowering we're bending through

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.220 
as we're lowering we're bending through
our<00:01:00.920> hips<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:01.490> knees<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.030> our<00:01:02.150> ankles<00:01:02.630> okay

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
our hips and knees and our ankles okay

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.490 
our hips and knees and our ankles okay
so<00:01:03.530> that<00:01:03.860> takes<00:01:04.129> us<00:01:04.339> down<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.659> if<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:06.079> wanted<00:01:06.409> to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
so that takes us down but if I wanted to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.310 
so that takes us down but if I wanted to
go<00:01:06.650> down<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:06.979> forward<00:01:07.520> which<00:01:08.420> joint<00:01:08.900> is<00:01:09.140> like

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
go down and forward which joint is like

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.969 
go down and forward which joint is like
a<00:01:09.350> big<00:01:09.679> arrow<00:01:09.950> saying<00:01:10.729> go<00:01:11.420> forward<00:01:12.229> out<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:12.770> the

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
a big arrow saying go forward out of the

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.010 
a big arrow saying go forward out of the
hips<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.369> knees<00:01:13.490> or<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.819> ankles<00:01:14.299> I<00:01:14.600> would<00:01:14.869> say

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
hips the knees or the ankles I would say

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.959 
hips the knees or the ankles I would say
the<00:01:15.170> knee<00:01:15.319> yeah<00:01:15.679> exactly<00:01:16.069> it's<00:01:16.429> like<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.670> big

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
the knee yeah exactly it's like a big

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.480 
the knee yeah exactly it's like a big
old<00:01:17.119> arrow<00:01:17.299> saying<00:01:17.749> go<00:01:17.960> forward<00:01:18.409> now<00:01:19.189> if<00:01:19.340> we

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
old arrow saying go forward now if we

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.669 
old arrow saying go forward now if we
were<00:01:19.609> going<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:19.880> go<00:01:19.999> backwards<00:01:20.299> all<00:01:21.170> three

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
were going to go backwards all three

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.620 
were going to go backwards all three
joints<00:01:22.039> are<00:01:22.159> always<00:01:22.460> going<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.789> bend<00:01:23.060> but

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
joints are always going to bend but

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.109 
joints are always going to bend but
which<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.139> joint<00:01:24.469> that<00:01:24.740> allows<00:01:25.069> me<00:01:25.460> to<00:01:25.969> go

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
which is the joint that allows me to go

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.879 
which is the joint that allows me to go
backwards<00:01:26.630> imagine<00:01:27.139> first<00:01:27.409> pointing

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
backwards imagine first pointing

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.039 
backwards imagine first pointing
backwards<00:01:28.340> reverse<00:01:28.639> would<00:01:28.909> be<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.359> hip<00:01:29.780> joint

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
backwards reverse would be the hip joint

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.559 
backwards reverse would be the hip joint
right<00:01:30.289> exactly<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.039> if<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.399> had<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.609> chair<00:01:31.999> that<00:01:32.539> I

little bit too far back exactly but now

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.899 
little bit too far back exactly but now
we<00:02:02.869> want<00:02:03.079> to<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:03.349> this<00:02:03.560> without<00:02:04.159> breaking<00:02:04.789> our

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.749 
we want to do this without breaking our
posture<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.200> we<00:02:06.409> want<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.679> have<00:02:06.829> our<00:02:06.979> weight<00:02:07.340> on

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
posture so we want to have our weight on

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.330 
posture so we want to have our weight on
the<00:02:08.390> correct<00:02:08.720> part<00:02:08.959> of<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.110> fluid<00:02:09.530> foot<00:02:09.770> to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
the correct part of the fluid foot to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.910 
the correct part of the fluid foot to
get<00:02:10.520> maximum<00:02:11.150> Drive<00:02:11.630> forward<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.470> backwards

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
get maximum Drive forward and backwards

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.830 
get maximum Drive forward and backwards
so<00:02:13.459> when<00:02:13.610> we're<00:02:13.790> moving<00:02:13.910> forwards<00:02:14.540> basically

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
so when we're moving forwards basically

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.570 
so when we're moving forwards basically
if<00:02:14.900> I'm<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.260> doing<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.590> walking<00:02:15.980> step<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.490> I

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
if I'm just doing a walking step and I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.830 
if I'm just doing a walking step and I

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
to fall into the step because I have too

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.110 
to fall into the step because I have too
much<00:03:24.769> weight<00:03:25.040> on<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> front<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.700> foot<00:03:25.880> are

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
you're going to fall right so from here

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.809 
you're going to fall right so from here
if<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.680> put<00:03:30.920> my<00:03:31.069> weight<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.430> where<00:03:31.579> I<00:03:31.609> could

click my toes up and down and again it's
only<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.920> minut<00:03:34.310> difference<00:03:34.819> you<00:03:35.540> can<00:03:35.720> see

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
only in minut difference you can see

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.680 
only in minut difference you can see
that<00:03:36.139> my<00:03:36.290> knees<00:03:36.650> are<00:03:36.680> freed<00:03:37.459> up<00:03:37.670> now<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.540> do<00:03:38.660> a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
that my knees are freed up now to do a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.500 
that my knees are freed up now to do a
nice<00:03:38.959> bending<00:03:39.470> action<00:03:39.680> to<00:03:40.459> walk<00:03:40.670> forward<00:03:41.239> so

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
nice bending action to walk forward so

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.849 
nice bending action to walk forward so
what<00:03:41.660> happens<00:03:42.019> is<00:03:42.200> if<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.500> your<00:03:42.709> weight

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
what happens is if you have your weight

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.990 
what happens is if you have your weight
on<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.099> back<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.549> foot<00:03:43.700> when<00:03:43.880> you're

going to swing forward when you flex

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.039 
going to swing forward when you flex
your<00:03:46.190> knees<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.819> actually<00:03:47.150> rolls<00:03:47.389> you<00:03:47.720> through

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
your knees it actually rolls you through

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
from the back to the front of the foot

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.339 
from the back to the front of the foot
right<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.299> makes<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.840> nice<00:03:51.019> smooth

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
right and makes the nice smooth

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.470 
right and makes the nice smooth
transition<00:03:51.980> going<00:03:52.130> forward<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:52.730> if<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.030> did<00:03:53.269> say

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
transition going forward so if I did say

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.599 
transition going forward so if I did say
a<00:03:53.690> man's<00:03:53.930> feather<00:03:54.260> step<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.829> I<00:03:54.919> move<00:03:55.130> forward

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
a man's feather step and I move forward

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.759 
a man's feather step and I move forward
like<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:56.120> my<00:03:56.419> hips<00:03:56.690> get<00:03:56.870> caught<00:03:57.139> behind<00:03:57.470> me

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
like this my hips get caught behind me

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.530 
like this my hips get caught behind me
and<00:03:57.919> I'm<00:03:58.010> falling<00:03:58.579> forward<00:03:58.849> into<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.269> step

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
and I'm falling forward into the step

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.199 
and I'm falling forward into the step
whereas<00:04:00.410> without<00:04:00.590> leaning<00:04:01.130> back<00:04:01.609> still

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
whereas without leaning back still

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.599 
whereas without leaning back still
stretched<00:04:02.630> up<00:04:02.870> if<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.560> let<00:04:03.829> my<00:04:03.980> weight<00:04:04.250> land

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
stretched up if I let my weight land

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.759 
stretched up if I let my weight land
behind<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.389> foot<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.900> let<00:04:06.169> the<00:04:06.319> foot<00:04:06.530> stretch

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
behind the foot and let the foot stretch

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.220 
behind the foot and let the foot stretch
out<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.160> front<00:04:07.549> of<00:04:07.669> me<00:04:07.849> I<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.810> get<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:08.989> nice

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
out in front of me I can get a nice

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.050 
out in front of me I can get a nice
driving<00:04:09.799> action<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.549> stay<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:10.940> the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
driving action so you stay on the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.330 
driving action so you stay on the
standing<00:04:11.540> foot<00:04:11.720> longer<00:04:12.380> because<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.099> takes

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
standing foot longer because it takes

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.129 
standing foot longer because it takes
you<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.639> much<00:04:13.819> time<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.269> roll<00:04:14.480> from<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.930> back

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
you that much time to roll from the back

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.750 
you that much time to roll from the back
all<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.620> way<00:04:15.980> through<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.370> front<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
all the way through the front of the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.759 
all the way through the front of the
foot<00:04:17.030> that's<00:04:17.299> right<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.959> so<00:04:18.019> how<00:04:18.380> about<00:04:18.410> going

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
foot that's right and so how about going

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.740 
foot that's right and so how about going
backwards<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.489> if<00:04:19.910> I'm<00:04:20.060> going<00:04:20.269> backwards

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
backwards so if I'm going backwards

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.879 
backwards so if I'm going backwards
let's<00:04:20.959> say<00:04:21.139> if<00:04:21.260> we're<00:04:21.380> starting<00:04:21.739> in<00:04:21.829> the

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
let's say if we're starting in the

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.839 
let's say if we're starting in the
position<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.310> we<00:04:22.430> were<00:04:22.520> going<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:22.729> go

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
position that we were going to go

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.400 
position that we were going to go
forwards<00:04:23.180> if<00:04:23.300> my<00:04:23.450> weight<00:04:23.690> was<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.110> back<00:04:24.260> of

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
forwards if my weight was on the back of

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.620 
forwards if my weight was on the back of
my<00:04:24.560> foot<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.490> bent<00:04:25.729> my<00:04:25.789> hips<00:04:26.150> right<00:04:26.390> now

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
my foot and I bent my hips right now

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.320 
my foot and I bent my hips right now
again<00:04:27.469> I'm<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.860> falling<00:04:28.340> position<00:04:28.909> so<00:04:29.180> if

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
again I'm in a falling position so if

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.969 
again I'm in a falling position so if
I'm<00:04:29.510> falling<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.260> first<00:04:30.500> thing<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.830> do

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
I'm falling the first thing that you do

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.210 
I'm falling the first thing that you do
is

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
is

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.250 
is
you<00:04:31.310> catch<00:04:31.640> your<00:04:31.910> weight<00:04:32.120> with<00:04:32.330> your<00:04:32.480> foot<00:04:32.720> now

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
the size of step that you can take if

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.930 
the size of step that you can take if
you're<00:04:35.030> falling<00:04:35.510> is<00:04:35.660> very<00:04:36.200> small<00:04:36.590> however<00:04:37.460> if

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.650 
Center and then Bend through the hips to
straight<00:04:48.470> back<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.190> can<00:04:49.700> take<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:49.970> much<00:04:50.330> bigger

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
straight back I can take a much bigger

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.470 
straight back I can take a much bigger
step<00:04:51.160> backwards<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.850> basically<00:04:53.240> you're

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
step backwards so basically you're

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.390 
step backwards so basically you're
rolling<00:04:53.900> from<00:04:54.140> the<00:04:54.320> front<00:04:54.680> of<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:54.890> foot<00:04:55.130> all

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
rolling from the front of the foot all

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.280 
rolling from the front of the foot all
the<00:04:55.700> way<00:04:55.820> through<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.330> foot<00:04:56.570> off<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.050> back<00:04:57.260> of

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
the way through the foot off the back of

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.810 
the way through the foot off the back of
the<00:04:57.590> foot<00:04:57.800> that's<00:04:58.310> right

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
the foot that's right

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.230 
the foot that's right
so<00:04:59.240> we<00:04:59.480> have<00:04:59.750> our<00:04:59.930> centers<00:05:00.440> lined<00:05:00.890> up

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
so we have our centers lined up

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.460 
so we have our centers lined up
differently<00:05:02.240> for<00:05:02.570> forward<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:02.960> backward

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
differently for forward and backward

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.310 
differently for forward and backward
swing<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:05.120> can<00:05:05.300> try<00:05:05.480> this<00:05:05.540> with<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.870> partner

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
swing so you can try this with a partner

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.110 
swing so you can try this with a partner
so<00:05:06.710> if<00:05:06.800> I'm<00:05:06.920> going<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.160> go<00:05:07.250> forwards<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:07.970> what

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
so if I'm going to go forwards and what

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.790 
so if I'm going to go forwards and what
I<00:05:08.150> need<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.510> do<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:08.930> need<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.200> make<00:05:09.350> sure<00:05:09.380> that

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
I need to do is I need to make sure that

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.070 
I need to do is I need to make sure that
my<00:05:10.130> weights<00:05:10.520> towards<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:11.300> back<00:05:11.510> of<00:05:11.690> my<00:05:11.840> foot

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
my weights towards the back of my foot

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.460 
my weights towards the back of my foot
so<00:05:12.650> when<00:05:12.800> I<00:05:12.830> flex<00:05:13.130> my<00:05:13.280> knee<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:14.260> can<00:05:15.260> roll

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
so when I flex my knee I can roll

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.170 
so when I flex my knee I can roll
through<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:15.920> foot<00:05:15.950> right<00:05:16.490> when<00:05:16.880> I'm<00:05:17.000> going<00:05:17.150> to

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
through the foot right when I'm going to

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.090 
through the foot right when I'm going to
go<00:05:17.330> backwards<00:05:17.930> I<00:05:18.200> need<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.590> make<00:05:18.740> sure<00:05:18.770> it's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
go backwards I need to make sure it's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.420 
go backwards I need to make sure it's
towards<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:20.020> front<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.200> foot<00:05:21.470> so<00:05:22.100> I'll<00:05:22.310> go

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
towards the front of the foot so I'll go

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.130 
towards the front of the foot so I'll go
back<00:05:22.580> on<00:05:22.730> my<00:05:22.760> right<00:05:22.970> foot<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.810> I<00:05:23.840> go<00:05:24.110> through

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
back on my right foot so I go through

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.500 
back on my right foot so I go through
the<00:05:24.470> front<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:24.980> foot<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.790> that<00:05:25.850> way<00:05:26.330> I<00:05:26.360> can

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
the front of the foot and that way I can

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.930 
the front of the foot and that way I can
roll<00:05:26.840> through<00:05:27.140> my<00:05:27.290> foot<00:05:27.560> my<00:05:27.830> whole<00:05:28.130> foot<00:05:28.490> as<00:05:28.669> I

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
roll through my foot my whole foot as I

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.330 
roll through my foot my whole foot as I
move<00:05:29.210> right<00:05:29.870> now<00:05:30.169> what<00:05:30.380> you'll<00:05:30.530> notice<00:05:30.710> is<00:05:31.100> if

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
move right now what you'll notice is if

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.950 
move right now what you'll notice is if
you're<00:05:31.460> dancing<00:05:31.640> this<00:05:32.000> with<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.210> partner<00:05:32.510> if

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
you're dancing this with a partner if

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.600 
you're dancing this with a partner if
you're<00:05:33.530> standing<00:05:34.040> together

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
you're standing together

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.670 
you're standing together
if<00:05:34.730> Michael<00:05:35.300> goes<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.870> back<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.200> his<00:05:36.350> foot

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
if Michael goes to the back of his foot

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.620 
if Michael goes to the back of his foot
if<00:05:36.890> I'm<00:05:37.130> connected<00:05:37.550> with<00:05:37.700> him<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:38.210> brings<00:05:38.450> me

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
if I'm connected with him that brings me

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.270 
if I'm connected with him that brings me
to<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.870> front<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.169> my<00:05:39.200> foot<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.680> then<00:05:40.070> if<00:05:40.190> he

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
to the front of my foot and then if he

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.010 
to the front of my foot and then if he
goes<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.640> front<00:05:40.880> of<00:05:40.940> his<00:05:41.090> foot<00:05:41.330> I<00:05:41.510> go<00:05:41.960> to

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
goes to the front of his foot I go to

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.450 
goes to the front of his foot I go to
the<00:05:42.169> back<00:05:42.320> of<00:05:42.350> mine<00:05:42.680> so<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.040> distance<00:05:43.370> between

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
the back of mine so the distance between

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.490 
the back of mine so the distance between
our<00:05:43.730> frame<00:05:44.090> stays<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.630> same<00:05:44.660> the<00:05:44.990> whole<00:05:45.020> time

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
our frame stays the same the whole time

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.710 
our frame stays the same the whole time
this<00:05:46.250> is<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.430> minut<00:05:46.820> difference<00:05:47.330> but<00:05:47.479> very

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
this is a minut difference but very

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.930 
this is a minut difference but very
important<00:05:48.350> so<00:05:48.830> it's<00:05:48.950> like<00:05:49.100> an<00:05:49.220> automatic<00:05:49.550> lead

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
important so it's like an automatic lead

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.630 
important so it's like an automatic lead
so<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.570> just<00:05:50.600> by<00:05:51.110> configuring<00:05:51.500> my<00:05:51.800> body<00:05:52.400> in

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
so and just by configuring my body in

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.550 
so and just by configuring my body in
the<00:05:52.729> right<00:05:52.880> position<00:05:52.940> over<00:05:53.510> my<00:05:53.690> foot<00:05:53.960> to

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
the right position over my foot to

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.460 
the right position over my foot to
either<00:05:54.800> swing<00:05:55.100> forwards<00:05:55.490> or<00:05:55.580> backwards

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
either swing forwards or backwards

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.650 
either swing forwards or backwards
automatically<00:05:57.470> if<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.620> lady's<00:05:58.010> going<00:05:58.220> to

and<00:06:13.700> now<00:06:14.570> we'll<00:06:14.900> demonstrate<00:06:15.020> with<00:06:15.530> Michael

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
and now we'll demonstrate with Michael

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.380 
and now we'll demonstrate with Michael
going<00:06:16.070> backwards<00:06:16.520> you<00:06:16.669> can<00:06:16.820> see<00:06:16.970> he<00:06:17.090> put<00:06:17.270> his

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
going backwards you can see he put his

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.210 
going backwards you can see he put his
weight<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:17.750> the<00:06:17.840> front<00:06:18.050> of<00:06:18.140> the<00:06:18.229> foot<00:06:18.410> to<00:06:18.979> bring

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
weight to the front of the foot to bring

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.820 
weight to the front of the foot to bring
me<00:06:19.400> forward<00:06:19.850> and<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.390> whole<00:06:20.570> time<00:06:20.840> I<00:06:21.080> maintain

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
me forward and the whole time I maintain

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.800 
me forward and the whole time I maintain
my<00:06:22.040> weight<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.520> little<00:06:23.120> bit<00:06:23.240> more<00:06:23.390> to<00:06:23.540> the<00:06:23.630> back

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
my weight a little bit more to the back

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.900 
my weight a little bit more to the back
of<00:06:23.960> the<00:06:24.050> foot<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.470> stay<00:06:24.890> behind<00:06:24.950> the<00:06:25.550> moving

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910
