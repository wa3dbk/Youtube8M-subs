structural parts let me show you how
this<00:00:32.820> works<00:00:33.530> as<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.920> see<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.399> little

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
this works as you can see these little

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.670 
this works as you can see these little
vials<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.390> color-coded<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> can't

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
vials are all color-coded so you can't

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.920 
vials are all color-coded so you can't
make<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> mistake<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.270> handy<00:00:39.690> carrying

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
make a mistake and this handy carrying

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.560 
make a mistake and this handy carrying
case<00:00:40.200> comes<00:00:40.440> apart<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.270> slip<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
case comes apart so you can slip the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:54.010 
case comes apart so you can slip the
vials<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:08.270 

then<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> snap<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> together<00:01:07.280> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
then you just snap it together and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.670 
then you just snap it together and
you're<00:01:08.490> ready<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:08.970> work

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
you're ready to go to work

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we used our little spot-check jr. kit to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.139 
we used our little spot-check jr. kit to
check<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.710> head<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.640> seems<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> be

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
check out this head and it seems to be

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.749 
check out this head and it seems to be
okay<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:16.259> were<00:01:16.380> especially<00:01:16.590> careful<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.520> check

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
okay we were especially careful to check

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.880 
okay we were especially careful to check
for<00:01:17.970> cracks<00:01:18.330> between<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:18.960> valve<00:01:19.290> pockets

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
for cracks between these valve pockets

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.370 
for cracks between these valve pockets
but<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.610> around<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.750> good

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
but all around in here are good

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
but all around in here are good
candidates<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.040> cracks<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> gets<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
candidates for cracks because it gets so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.169 
candidates for cracks because it gets so
hot<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:24.990> these<00:01:25.320> valves<00:01:25.890> now<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.820> this

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
hot around these valves now on this

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.150 
hot around these valves now on this
intake<00:01:27.630> manifold<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> know<00:01:28.380> there's<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:28.860> crack

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
intake manifold I know there's a crack

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.040 
intake manifold I know there's a crack
right<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.910> let<00:01:30.330> me<00:01:30.390> show<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.869> we're

going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.350> about<00:01:31.440> detecting<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.340> though

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
going to go about detecting it though

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.600 
going to go about detecting it though
I'm<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.330> shoot<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.840> cleaner<00:01:34.610> clean

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I'm going to shoot on this cleaner clean

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
I'm going to shoot on this cleaner clean
it<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.940> up<00:01:36.179> make<00:01:36.750> sure<00:01:36.780> there's<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.500> no<00:01:37.710> dirt

or<00:01:38.820> grease<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.140> could

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
or grease in there because that could

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.010 
or grease in there because that could
invalidate<00:01:40.740> our<00:01:41.220> test<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> looks

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
invalidate our test now that looks

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
invalidate our test now that looks

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
shoot on some of the red dye that

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.540 
shoot on some of the red dye that
penetrating<00:01:48.750> dye<00:01:48.929> okay<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> we'll<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.399> let

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
penetrating dye okay and we'll just let

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.330 
penetrating dye okay and we'll just let
that<00:01:50.729> set<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.360> minute<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.810> dry<00:01:52.319> up<00:01:55.340> okay

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that set for a minute and dry up okay

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.700 
that set for a minute and dry up okay
that<00:01:56.520> should<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.729> long<00:01:57.060> enough<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.530> get

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that should be long enough now to get

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.920 
that should be long enough now to get
the<00:01:58.829> excess<00:01:59.280> dye<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.090> shoot<00:02:00.329> some<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.750> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the excess dye off we shoot some of this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.859 
the excess dye off we shoot some of this
cleaner<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.490> rag<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> part<00:02:03.600> but

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
cleaner on the rag not on the part but

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.380 
cleaner on the rag not on the part but
on<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> rag<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.649> take<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.790> excess<00:02:06.240> dye<00:02:06.509> away

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
on the rag and take that excess dye away

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.030 
on the rag and take that excess dye away
if<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.810> shoot<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> right<00:02:10.290> on<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> part<00:02:10.769> you'll

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
if you shoot it right on the part you'll

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.800 
if you shoot it right on the part you'll
dilute<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.579> penetrating<00:02:12.060> dye<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.329> the<00:02:12.570> point

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
dilute the penetrating dye to the point

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.750 
dilute the penetrating dye to the point
where<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.079> won't<00:02:13.200> show<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> crack<00:02:15.320> okay

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
where it won't show the crack okay

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
where it won't show the crack okay
that's<00:02:17.760> about<00:02:17.970> right<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.420> guess<00:02:18.780> let's<00:02:19.470> see

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
that's about right I guess let's see

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.150 
that's about right I guess let's see
here<00:02:20.450> get<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.780> more<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.110> there<00:02:22.350> okay

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
here get a little more out of there okay

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.090 
here get a little more out of there okay
now<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.060> final<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.620> shoot<00:02:25.890> on

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
now the final thing to do is to shoot on

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.660 
now the final thing to do is to shoot on
the<00:02:26.610> white<00:02:26.959> powder<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.620> develops<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.489> dye

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
the white powder that develops the dye

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.560 
the white powder that develops the dye
in<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:31.049> crack<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.880> start<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.030> appear<00:02:33.390> like

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
in the crack and start to appear like

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.850 
in the crack and start to appear like
magic

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.210 

right<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.240> there

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
right in there

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.730 
right in there
