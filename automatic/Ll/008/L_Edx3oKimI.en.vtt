created in quotations a super team I
suppose<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> mean<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:26.779> incredibly

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
suppose I mean it's not incredibly

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359

amazing<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.500> mean<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> very

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
amazing I mean I do think it's a very

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.189 
amazing I mean I do think it's a very
strong<00:00:29.880> side<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.570> got<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:30.990> high

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
strong side and it's got a lot of high

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
strong side and it's got a lot of high
rated<00:00:31.619> players<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> but<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:33.059> sure<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
rated players in it but I'm sure you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.520 
rated players in it but I'm sure you
could<00:00:33.510> probably<00:00:33.540> someone<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.380> there

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
could probably someone out there

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.110 
could probably someone out there
probably<00:00:34.739> made<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> better<00:00:35.280> team<00:00:35.520> anyways<00:00:35.880> but

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
probably made a better team anyways but

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000 
probably made a better team anyways but
I<00:00:36.480> thought<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.899> thought<00:00:37.290> I'd<00:00:37.380> create<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
hybrid but there's a couple other

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.430 
hybrid but there's a couple other
players<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.840> aren't<00:00:42.989> necessarily

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
players in there that aren't necessarily

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
players in there that aren't necessarily
from<00:00:43.770> those<00:00:43.950> clubs<00:00:44.940> initially<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.690> um<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.260> got

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
from those clubs initially so um you got

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
from those clubs initially so um you got
like<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.739> master<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.280> who<00:00:47.460> isn't<00:00:47.789> from

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
like some master there who isn't from

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.670 
like some master there who isn't from
either<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.629> those<00:00:48.690> clubs<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.140> he<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.289> Spanish

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
either of those clubs but he is Spanish

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
either of those clubs but he is Spanish
so<00:00:49.710> he<00:00:49.890> fits<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> squad<00:00:50.670> nicely<00:00:51.120> anyways

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
so he fits into the squad nicely anyways

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 
so he fits into the squad nicely anyways
so<00:00:52.440> I've<00:00:52.920> gone<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> goalkeeper<00:00:53.670> Casillas

so<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.730> me<00:03:12.880> Balotelli<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.569> probably<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.799> star

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
so for me Balotelli is probably the star

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.670 
so for me Balotelli is probably the star
of<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.640> team<00:03:15.849> I'd<00:03:16.120> say<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:17.140> know<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.260> just<00:03:17.380> find

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
of the team I'd say you know I just find

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.140 
of the team I'd say you know I just find
that<00:03:17.859> he<00:03:18.010> does<00:03:18.190> things<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.519> best<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
that he does things the best and I get a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.880 
that he does things the best and I get a
little<00:03:19.299> bit<00:03:19.450> lucky<00:03:19.780> there<00:03:19.989> Balotelli<00:03:20.620> when

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
little bit lucky there Balotelli when

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.319 
little bit lucky there Balotelli when
the<00:03:21.010> scissor<00:03:21.220> kicking<00:03:21.609> it<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.790> deflects<00:03:22.209> off

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
the scissor kicking it and deflects off

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.270 
the scissor kicking it and deflects off
his<00:03:23.200> centre<00:03:23.530> back<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.799> goes<00:03:23.890> into<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.190> back

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
his centre back and goes into the back

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.069 
his centre back and goes into the back
of<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.459> net<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:24.609> that<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:24.880> pretty<00:03:25.000> lucky<00:03:25.450> but

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
of the net so that was pretty lucky but

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.949 
of the net so that was pretty lucky but
this<00:03:26.470> team<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.299> haven't<00:03:28.480> slightly

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
this team I have I haven't slightly

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.259 
this team I have I haven't slightly

a very good team you know there's no
there's<00:03:33.069> no<00:03:33.190> way<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.609> say<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:33.910> is<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> bad

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
there's no way you can say this is a bad

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.690 
there's no way you can say this is a bad
team<00:03:34.600> because<00:03:34.959> just<00:03:35.769> through<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> stats<00:03:36.579> of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
team because just through the stats of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.819 
team because just through the stats of
these<00:03:36.850> players<00:03:37.060> they<00:03:37.299> are<00:03:37.329> very<00:03:37.750> good<00:03:38.019> but<00:03:38.620> I

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
these players they are very good but I

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.559 
these players they are very good but I
don't<00:03:38.890> feel<00:03:39.400> as<00:03:39.579> though<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:39.790> have<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.390> much

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
don't feel as though I have that much

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.660 
don't feel as though I have that much
enjoyment<00:03:41.049> using<00:03:41.680> them<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.459> might<00:03:42.639> be

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
enjoyment using them and that might be

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.129 
enjoyment using them and that might be
because<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:43.239> know<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.359> like<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.660> try<00:03:43.989> out<00:03:44.109> a

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
because you know I like to try out a

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.720 
because you know I like to try out a
bunch<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.530> different<00:03:44.859> types<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.250> players<00:03:45.430> and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
bunch of different types of players and

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.699 
bunch of different types of players and
things<00:03:45.880> but<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.630> in<00:03:46.750> general<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.290> didn't<00:03:47.560> find

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
things but just in general I didn't find

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.620 
things but just in general I didn't find
myself<00:03:47.950> having<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.850> lot<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.180> fun<00:03:49.299> using<00:03:49.450> this

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
myself having a lot of fun using this

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.229 
myself having a lot of fun using this
team<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.019> mean<00:03:50.049> I<00:03:50.230> was<00:03:50.880> beating<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.970> lot<00:03:52.120> of

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
team I mean I was beating a lot of

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.539 
team I mean I was beating a lot of
players<00:03:52.450> but<00:03:52.780> at<00:03:53.230> times<00:03:53.560> I<00:03:53.739> was<00:03:53.889> like<00:03:53.920> these

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
players but at times I was like these

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.190 
players but at times I was like these
players<00:03:54.850> are<00:03:55.030> feeling<00:03:55.180> quite<00:03:55.510> sluggish<00:03:55.810> and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
players are feeling quite sluggish and

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.660 
players are feeling quite sluggish and
things<00:03:56.410> were<00:03:56.560> going<00:03:56.769> my<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> lot<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.519> the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
things were going my way a lot of the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.120 
things were going my way a lot of the
times<00:03:57.880> whereas<00:03:58.540> if<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.780> use<00:03:58.810> my<00:03:59.290> Spanish<00:03:59.920> non

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
times whereas if I use my Spanish non

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.430 
times whereas if I use my Spanish non
rare<00:04:00.370> side<00:04:00.639> I<00:04:00.880> find<00:04:01.389> that<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.690> things<00:04:02.079> tend<00:04:02.380> to

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
rare side I find that I things tend to

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.410 
rare side I find that I things tend to
go<00:04:02.620> my<00:04:02.769> way<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:02.980> lot<00:04:03.280> more<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.030> feel<00:04:04.299> as

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
go my way a lot more that I feel as

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.490 
go my way a lot more that I feel as
though<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.630> game<00:04:04.810> plays<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:05.079> little<00:04:05.290> bit

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
though the game plays a little bit

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.009 
though the game plays a little bit
smoother<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.100> things<00:04:06.670> just<00:04:06.880> tend<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.180> tend<00:04:07.900> to

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
smoother and things just tend to tend to

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.080 
smoother and things just tend to tend to
feel<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.290> little<00:04:08.530> bit<00:04:08.739> more<00:04:08.799> fun<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.940> might

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
feel a little bit more fun so that might

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.460 
feel a little bit more fun so that might
just<00:04:10.269> be<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.510> way<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.019> how<00:04:11.170> about<00:04:11.319> that

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
just be the way it is and how about that

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.129 
just be the way it is and how about that
for<00:04:11.889> a<00:04:11.980> goal<00:04:12.160> what<00:04:12.730> an<00:04:12.910> absolute<00:04:13.630> FIFA<00:04:13.959> fail

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
for a goal what an absolute FIFA fail

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.270 
for a goal what an absolute FIFA fail
that's<00:04:14.380> why<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.620> put<00:04:14.859> it<00:04:14.950> in<00:04:15.100> there<00:04:15.250> just

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
that's why I put it in there just

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.909 
that's why I put it in there just
because<00:04:15.639> of<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.880> that<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.840> impact<00:04:17.470> engine

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
because of that that the impact engine

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.129 
because of that that the impact engine
failed<00:04:18.190> hard<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.850> guy<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.690> really<00:04:19.989> did

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
failed hard on that guy and I really did

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.719 
failed hard on that guy and I really did
feel<00:04:20.350> bad<00:04:20.560> for<00:04:20.709> him<00:04:20.829> cuz<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.010> was<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.280> one<00:04:21.459> off<00:04:21.609> at

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
feel bad for him cuz I was to one off at

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.190

he couldn't come back that I kind of

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.010 
he couldn't come back that I kind of
spoiled<00:04:25.030> his<00:04:25.120> chances<00:04:25.480> of<00:04:25.510> coming<00:04:25.630> back<00:04:25.870> and
