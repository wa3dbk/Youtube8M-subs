 old-fashioned tricky 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.980
 the spicy platform puzzles are a pleasure for Mario veterans 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.900

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.540
 to show up 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.840
 defeating these enemies once is fine, but when you return to a world 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
