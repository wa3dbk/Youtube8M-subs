hands like I'm doing here and then I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.110 
hands like I'm doing here and then I
didn't<00:02:31.200> actually<00:02:31.380> use<00:02:31.830> any<00:02:32.010> foil<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.910> can

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
didn't actually use any foil but you can

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.900

go ahead and coat these in foil but this

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.780 
go ahead and coat these in foil but this
is<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.210> they<00:02:36.390> should<00:02:36.440> look<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.459> I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
is what they should look like and then I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.199 
is what they should look like and then I
left<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.450> hair<00:02:39.750> dye<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.350> for<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:41.430> 40

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.570 
left this hair dye on for about 40
minutes<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.930> usually<00:02:43.410> says<00:02:43.709> on<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.160> packet

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
minutes it usually says on the packet

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.240 
minutes it usually says on the packet
how<00:02:44.790> long<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.510> recommended<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.530> leave<00:02:46.800> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
how long it's recommended to leave the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.880 
how long it's recommended to leave the
dye<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:48.120> once<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.480> had<00:02:48.660> left<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.620> that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
dye on so once I had left it on for that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.400 
dye on so once I had left it on for that
amount<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.310> time<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.910> I'd<00:02:51.840> gone<00:02:52.020> through<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
amount of time and I'd gone through and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.720 
amount of time and I'd gone through and
checked<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.709> had<00:02:53.010> actually<00:02:53.280> changed<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
checked that had actually changed the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.240 
checked that had actually changed the
color<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.000> bit<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.540> went<00:02:55.140> through<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.590> rinsed

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
color a bit I went through and rinsed

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.380 
color a bit I went through and rinsed
off<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:57.200> hair<00:02:58.200> dye<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:59.430> lot<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.150> time

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
off the hair dye and a lot of the time

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.390 
off the hair dye and a lot of the time
in<00:03:00.810> fact<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.170> think<00:03:01.410> all<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.800> time<00:03:02.010> hair

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
in fact I think all of the time hair

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.550 
in fact I think all of the time hair
dyes<00:03:02.700> do<00:03:03.390> actually<00:03:03.750> come<00:03:03.989> with<00:03:04.050> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
dyes do actually come with a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.530 
dyes do actually come with a
conditioning<00:03:05.400> treatment<00:03:05.430> or<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> shampoo

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
let them air dry and then they should

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.930 
let them air dry and then they should
look<00:03:37.320> something<00:03:37.680> like<00:03:37.709> this<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:38.640> me

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
look something like this and this is me

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.920 
look something like this and this is me
with<00:03:39.750> them<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.200> after<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:41.070> been<00:03:41.220> dyed

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
with them in after they have been dyed

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.060

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
so you can kind of tell what they look

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.100 
so you can kind of tell what they look
like<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.519> doesn't<00:03:44.790> fully<00:03:45.090> match<00:03:45.330> my<00:03:45.540> hair<00:03:45.750> but

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
like it doesn't fully match my hair but

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.160 
like it doesn't fully match my hair but
it's<00:03:46.260> pretty<00:03:46.560> close<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:46.950> it<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.810> hope<00:03:49.019> you
