00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
I'm assuming that watering would be

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.100 
I'm assuming that watering would be
similar<00:06:19.520> to<00:06:19.550> the<00:06:20.210> other<00:06:20.240> stuff<00:06:20.570> you'd<00:06:20.780> mention

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
about like the readjustment Li once or

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.940 
about like the readjustment Li once or
twice<00:06:23.270> a<00:06:23.330> week<00:06:23.479> given<00:06:23.930> a<00:06:23.990> nice<00:06:24.200> big<00:06:24.470> drink<00:06:24.650> so

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
twice a week given a nice big drink so

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.409 
twice a week given a nice big drink so

it can gather up the water and it'll

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.850 
it can gather up the water and it'll
drain<00:06:26.750> away<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.110> that'll<00:06:27.290> be<00:06:27.410> what<00:06:27.560> they<00:06:27.680> love
