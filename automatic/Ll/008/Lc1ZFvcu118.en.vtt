00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
been a very important part of the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.570 
been a very important part of the
restaurant<00:03:45.870> dining<00:03:46.870> outside<00:03:47.140> our<00:03:47.980> season<00:03:48.430> in

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
restaurant dining outside our season in

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.780 
restaurant dining outside our season in
Ontario<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.390> quite<00:03:49.600> short<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.459> when<00:03:51.459> we<00:03:51.610> have

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
Ontario is quite short but when we have

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.400 
Ontario is quite short but when we have
the<00:03:51.940> opportunity<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.630> do<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.019> think<00:03:53.140> it's

the opportunity to do so I think it's

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.259 
the opportunity to do so I think it's
something<00:03:54.010> that's<00:03:54.280> very<00:03:54.340> European<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.090> very

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
something that's very European and very

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.509 
something that's very European and very
Mediterranean<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.050> fits<00:03:56.590> very<00:03:56.890> closely<00:03:57.160> to
