00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the institute of sports science in 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.490
 kassel every year finds a whole here 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.390
 special test instead of me this time 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.849
 take part 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.139
 I'm reporting sports today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.030
 fitness test of the uni kassel 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.679
 these are different disciplines 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 you have to run through it and I am 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.740
 already very excited before it starts 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.970
 I ask Professor Norbert Hagemann 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.369
 what matters here 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.359
 We test general skills like 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.039
 endurance fast power coordination 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.359
 but we also test sports-specific 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 you must emphasize that certain 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.530
 can demonstrate and also in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.980
 play places for example only if you 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.260
 These tasks may also be justified then 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 one also sports 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.020
 I'm curious if I'm after this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 may also study sports today 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.640
 and then slowly there is restlessness in the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 air 92 sporty women and men 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.840
 enter the eye sports hall to get in 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.180
 eight disciplines like gymnastics medicine ball 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 long-distance or continuous test 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.030
 also a obstacle course under 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.030
 time pressure is part of it 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:37.120
 I had a bit of trouble with that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.910
 coordination of the jump rope 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.170
 different exercises in a row and 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.790
 but otherwise I have everything flat 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 it's really hard 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.090
 I have six out of eight in total 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 Exercises caused problems 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.850
 we had the jump rope 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.530
 choreography still the two and a half 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.480
 kilometer run in twelve minutes 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.980
 but as one third of the participants 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.260
 I can do these two exercises in two 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.190
 take off again for a week and then allow 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.190
 I study sport
