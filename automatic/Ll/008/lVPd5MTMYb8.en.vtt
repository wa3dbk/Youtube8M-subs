Lenovo's<00:00:25.680> upgraded<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> 3200<00:00:27.330> x<00:00:27.449> 1800

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
Lenovo's upgraded to a 3200 x 1800

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
Lenovo's upgraded to a 3200 x 1800
resolution<00:00:28.680> basically<00:00:29.130> rocketing<00:00:29.580> past<00:00:29.820> all

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
resolution basically rocketing past all

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150 
resolution basically rocketing past all
of<00:00:30.119> its<00:00:30.330> peers<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> category<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
of its peers in the category and it's

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.560 
of its peers in the category and it's
not<00:00:32.369> just<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> high-resolution<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.270> also<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
not just a high-resolution it's also a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.420 
not just a high-resolution it's also a
pretty<00:00:33.840> damn<00:00:33.960> good<00:00:34.020> quality<00:00:34.620> because<00:00:34.829> its<00:00:34.920> IPS

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
pretty damn good quality because its IPS

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.010 
pretty damn good quality because its IPS
so<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.090> viewing<00:00:36.480> angles<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> be

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so the viewing angles are going to be

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
so the viewing angles are going to be
pretty<00:00:37.170> good<00:00:37.290> no<00:00:38.129> matter<00:00:38.160> how<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> how

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
pretty good no matter how are you how

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.119 
pretty good no matter how are you how
you're<00:00:39.090> using<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.719> also<00:00:40.040> 315<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you're using it and it's also 315 it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920 
you're using it and it's also 315 it
brightness<00:00:41.489> which<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.629> high<00:00:42.780> as

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
brightness which is about as high as

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959 
brightness which is about as high as
most<00:00:43.140> laptop<00:00:43.559> displays<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.370> right<00:00:44.610> now<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
most laptop displays go right now in the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.619 
most laptop displays go right now in the
brightness<00:00:45.300> spectrum<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.920> any<00:00:47.100> other

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
brightness spectrum so like any other

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.619 
brightness spectrum so like any other
yoga<00:00:48.629> laptop<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.350> flip<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> around<00:00:50.629> like

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
don't have that here because that would

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
don't have that here because that would
have<00:01:35.220> made<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> design<00:01:35.790> thicker<00:01:36.060> than<00:01:36.450> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have made the design thicker than it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
have made the design thicker than it
needed<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> also<00:01:37.500> would<00:01:37.710> have

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
needed to be and it also would have

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.140 
needed to be and it also would have
required<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.220> thicker<00:01:38.430> hinge<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.060> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
required a thicker hinge and for this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.450 
required a thicker hinge and for this
