00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.070 
Schwarzenegger back in the day basically
we<00:02:18.610> get<00:02:18.730> your<00:02:18.849> arm<00:02:19.030> stay<00:02:19.270> perpendicular<00:02:19.630> to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
we get your arm stay perpendicular to

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830 
we get your arm stay perpendicular to
the<00:02:20.170> floor<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.739> slowly<00:02:21.489> curl<00:02:22.000> up<00:02:22.239> really

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the floor and slowly curl up really

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.990 
the floor and slowly curl up really
isolating<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.349> bicep<00:02:23.770> souping<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> rest<00:02:24.880> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
isolating the bicep souping the rest of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.820 
isolating the bicep souping the rest of
the<00:02:25.060> top<00:02:25.300> seeing<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> bicep<00:02:26.230> squeeze<00:02:26.500> and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the top seeing the bicep squeeze and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.009 
the top seeing the bicep squeeze and
slowly<00:02:27.730> lowering<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.330> weight<00:02:28.360> should<00:02:28.959> be

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
slowly lowering the weight should be

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.259 
slowly lowering the weight should be
nice<00:02:29.349> my<00:02:29.769> muscle<00:02:30.160> connection<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.849> good<00:02:31.060> peak

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
nice my muscle connection and good peak

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.230 
nice my muscle connection and good peak
to<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.480> bicep<00:02:31.810> development
