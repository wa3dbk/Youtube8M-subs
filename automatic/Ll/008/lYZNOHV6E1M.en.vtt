00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.270
 diop everyone knows g sage I hope 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.890
 that you're fine I'm fine 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.690
 and today the guys we end up 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.140
 for the second episode of the series where 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.430
 I'm loose and let go nuclear come 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.660
 see that my part to start very very 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.760
 well and you will probably have noticed 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.730
 that I am in the mode of quite special 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.779
 in fact that is the elimination confirmed 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.649
 hardcore 3 this mode actually I do not know 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.690
 nothing but frankly I counted 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.969
 really do not want to hang out the air the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.989
 to play like that I saw gt1 not 36 but 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.670
 i think gm can he is in the process 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.129
 to film the jelly shot from the pen 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.039
 believe well and that's so I made the 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.239
 hitler and the really fast enough you really 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.620
 can see the video is not very good 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.179
 really 2 minutes 20 I think that's 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.859
 the fastest I saw at the top 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.719
 level is closed I think I have not seen 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.799
 faster american I say no because 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.879
 that there is surely faster but I 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.620
 know nothing but I think they will 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.780
 faster and also do maybe a 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.299
 French too but I'm faster 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.409
 Tell me I have not seen it yet 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.549
 finally short so that yes I know there you 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.289
 go see that I did a massacre going 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.210
 you expect so I have the killer is a 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.250
 guy 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.130
 after the junction I will say one thing 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.380
 I kill him I recharge up game here I 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.909
 my micro station so I anticipate the kills 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.680
 he too offers there there is another 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.950
 I arrive I swear on it that's already 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 6 I recharge and the agent u11 and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.060
 attention look at man's hand I'm doing a 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.159
 passenger sweeps that kind makes three 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.659
 aulas which massacre clearing and you 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.399
 go see I have a medal four 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.090
 pieces and you'll see I want 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.039
 retain a medal 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.679
 quite uncommon frankly that's it 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.549
 the extermination you can see 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.780
 frankly it was my first 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.100
 first time I got this medal 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.229
 you can see that I'm unlocking the challenge 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.369
 is really I was surprised at the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.719
 do I really thought not do it 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.999
 I thought lafarge kind mostly 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.619
 no and clem 27 for example I counted 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.909
 earlier the sphere in normal with the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.740
 peace of the two balls and let's go through 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.990
 example 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.280
 more than I imagined but good so much 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.259
 I did not do it so much 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 better and could see that really 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.250
 great fashion with a microstation that's 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 phew because you can anticipate 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.860
 disguise and even through the walls 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 it's a phew thing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.770
 this mode it really belligerents me and 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.170
 well liked it changes I do not know it's 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.050
 not at all the same thing by cons 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.099
 when normal I have a normal thing 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.810
 addressing normal or normal modes 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.980
 but hey it's indeed the pleasure 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.140
 could see in addition that I have a lot 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.510
 of luck in which country threw a grade 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.920
 People you so you 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.180
 in short, here is enough for 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.319
 to make good guys peace and so that's it 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.850
 we come to the end of this video 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.709

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.390
