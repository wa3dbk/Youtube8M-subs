right here kills and prevents mold but

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.540 
right here kills and prevents mold but
it<00:02:06.810> doesn't<00:02:07.050> have<00:02:07.140> any<00:02:07.350> bleach<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.920> any<00:02:08.130> nasty

it doesn't have any bleach or any nasty

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.440 
it doesn't have any bleach or any nasty
chemicals<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.240> that's<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> big<00:02:09.990> advantage

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
chemicals in it that's the big advantage

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
chemicals in it that's the big advantage
what<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.570> have<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.020> have<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.140> steel<00:02:13.410> product

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
what we have is we have a steel product

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260 
what we have is we have a steel product
that<00:02:13.950> we've<00:02:14.070> added<00:02:14.250> which<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> heavy<00:02:14.970> gauge

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that we've added which is a heavy gauge

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.540 
that we've added which is a heavy gauge
steel<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.040> see<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.490> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
steel and you can see that we have a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
steel and you can see that we have a
skid<00:02:17.760> plate<00:02:17.790> design<00:02:18.330> this<00:02:18.690> will<00:02:18.870> hold<00:02:19.020> about<00:02:19.530> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
skid plate design this will hold about a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.520 
skid plate design this will hold about a
thousand<00:02:20.070> pounds<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.580> also<00:02:20.700> two<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
thousand pounds but also two we have a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.990 
thousand pounds but also two we have a
shelving<00:02:22.530> unit<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:23.040> holds<00:02:23.190> 8,000<00:02:24.120> pounds

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
shelving unit that holds 8,000 pounds

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.790 
shelving unit that holds 8,000 pounds
yes<00:02:27.000> absolutely<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> way<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
yes absolutely so the way that that the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.190 
yes absolutely so the way that that the
perfect<00:02:29.010> seal<00:02:29.280> works<00:02:29.490> still<00:02:29.970> uses<00:02:30.300> wax<00:02:30.540> but

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
perfect seal works still uses wax but

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.260 
perfect seal works still uses wax but
the<00:02:31.410> wax<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.980> encapsulated<00:02:32.850> around<00:02:33.090> with

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the wax is encapsulated around with

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.820 
the wax is encapsulated around with
rubber<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.200> then<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.410> have<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> plastic

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
rubber and then you have a plastic

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.830 
rubber and then you have a plastic
flange<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.400> goes<00:02:35.610> around<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.270> what<00:02:36.420> what

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
flange that goes around so what what

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.660 
flange that goes around so what what
that's<00:02:36.960> doing<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.350> its<00:02:37.830> stabilizing<00:02:38.370> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
that's doing is its stabilizing the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
that's doing is its stabilizing the
bolts<00:02:39.030> real<00:02:39.540> cool<00:02:39.750> thing<00:02:39.780> about<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
bolts real cool thing about this is you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.320 
bolts real cool thing about this is you
can<00:02:40.950> feel<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.430> difference<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.940> feels<00:02:42.210> like

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
can feel the difference this feels like

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.520 
can feel the difference this feels like
it's<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> suction<00:02:43.080> cup<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.410> you're

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
it's the suction cup when you're

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530 
it's the suction cup when you're
dropping<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.980> down<00:02:44.010> versus<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.300> stepped

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
dropping it down versus like you stepped

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.850 
dropping it down versus like you stepped
in<00:02:45.660> gum

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.920
