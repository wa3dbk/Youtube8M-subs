00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.179
 The spark is not in the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.369

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 salt seasoning too little 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 the shrimp this time we're going to make a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.930
 tortilla with two eggs because the paper 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.080
 a little 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 Chinese onion and mince paprika applied 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.430

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 the bowl 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.920

 mom granny when she said a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.420
 tortilla with a fork 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.010
 and Chinese onion 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.490
 in the taste then have if you want 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.560
