00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.490
 hi i am heidi and these are the 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.240
 tutorials of the Martians arrived 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.240
 dot com 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.930
 hello everything in this project we are going to 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.000
 require of these materials and we are going to 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.940
 use the patterns that you can download 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.449
 from the marcelos website 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.630
 to a dot com indicating the baby magnet 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.050
 in the form of a puzzle 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.380
 here I already passed the patterns in the foam and 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.519
 with their respective colors and now 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.640
 we are going to section this doll in 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.440
 part because select it because this 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 magnet that you create has a way of 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 puzzle 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 and in that way children can play in 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.140
 the retc and eat the same way if you create 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 2 or 3 dolls of this style you can 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.360
 exchange bodies or heads or 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 little legs and it can be a pretty game 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 funny 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.240
 if you noticed is what I did was that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.340
 I made some indications of the section 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.990
 where I'm going to cut and then with the help 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 of the rule 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.660
 mark a line that is where I'm going to 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.850
 guide me for the scissors do not I here you 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.670
 I show the other two milestones that we cut 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.220
 with the help of the bosses this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.800
 ombliguito I cut it on my own 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.420
 these simple little circles and here is what 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.420
 another that comes to be the curl of our 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 baby these three pieces we are going to paste 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.920
 with glue 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.590
 well then we have our pieces 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 pasted made an indication here you 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.190
 I show with a punch where we are going to 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.240
 know here you could do two things 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.040
 painted 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.759
 what do I usually do with the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.979
 pizzas of coming but today I wanted to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.830
 train me in another technique that is sewing 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.810
 the pop that has a joke not while 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.159
 I'm doing it here ojitos 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.240
 what am I going to do and that the document 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.690
 is I'm going to do a little stitch around the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.470
 mark of the eye and then I will fill them 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.530
 and other new joints 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.810
 the joke that has to cook for me are 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 two things you can not press 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.200
 a lot because if you pull it you break it two 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.690
 the tips should not be very close 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.330
 for the same reason because if they are very 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.760
 close you can break the bottom 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.860
 and a trick that if I give you is that then 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440
 that you make a hole you can go back to 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 enter it then if stitches that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.150
 they are recurrent to the best you can 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.360
 use the same good 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.269
 on the other hand here I used a thread 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.700
 Threading only 2 I hope I can 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.450
 put together or be nice threading way 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.939
 normal but if you put it double the plot 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.140
 air that I show you from the ojito here what 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.690
 now I'm going to fill 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.959
 I told you that I have drawn then 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.600
 the stitching is much thicker then 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.020
 maybe in this case you do not need to do 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.380
 so many stitches 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.840
 and order our procedure here 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.410
 I'm passing stitches 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.910
 as transverse 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.910
 to fill the outline 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.780
 well and how are you going to observe I'll 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.170
 making the shape stitches 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.630
 cross section trying to place the threads 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.570
 from one place to another as more like 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.990
 Parallel going to go filling 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.960
 I'm going to make one last one or 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.620
 penultimate stitch here over 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.040
 and the amount of stitches you make 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.770
 It will be determined by how together or 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.650
 how close you place them then 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.460
 here we do the last if indeed 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.770
 the last 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.640
 and here we already have our team as 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.930
 you can see 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.490
 already behind and we did not have to do 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.290
 like sewing and we're going to do the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.290
 next nose and mouth 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.920
 and here I show you the finished figurine 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.830
 in the X, look what I did 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.709
 a crusade in the stitch granted and you 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.160
 I made my nose my mouth and some eyebrows with 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.079
 straight stitches and that's how the 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.210
 little details of the baby 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.139
 that now is your head horn as you see 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.240
 so be damn 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.199
 What we need is to place in the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.390
 from behind as a magnet base in this way 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.960
 so you can see it full 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.450
 a magnet of these that I regÃºstos between 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.360
 yes they are magnets that they employ with propagating 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.760
 our are flat and what we are going to 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.610
 do is cut out pieces and paste them in 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.800
 the back and we take advantage to 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.650
 cover the knots too 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.090
 and so I finished this tutorial project 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.460
 magnets 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.770
