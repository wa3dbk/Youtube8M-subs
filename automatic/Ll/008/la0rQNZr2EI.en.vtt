hair but I haven't brushed them out

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.750 
hair but I haven't brushed them out
because<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.560> don't<00:01:54.710> like<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.920> do<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.340> until

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
because I don't like to do that until

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.910 
because I don't like to do that until
I'm<00:01:55.880> completely<00:01:56.090> done<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.680> start

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
I'm completely done and I like to start

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.530 
I'm completely done and I like to start
at<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.100> root<00:01:58.130> of<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.520> hair<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.030> go<00:01:59.300> down

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
at the root of the hair and go down

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.690 
at the root of the hair and go down
because<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.650> me<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:00.950> gives<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> more

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
because to me it gives you a more

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.589 
because to me it gives you a more
intense<00:02:02.150> curl<00:02:06.010> okay<00:02:07.010> so<00:02:07.790> as<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.000> can<00:02:08.149> see<00:02:08.390> the

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
intense curl okay so as you can see the

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.210 
intense curl okay so as you can see the
curl<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.020> going<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.319> go<00:02:09.440> towards<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.979> back

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
curl is going to go towards the back

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.580 
curl is going to go towards the back

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
to hear and see how the curl is going to

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.959 
to hear and see how the curl is going to
go<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.409> back<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.739> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> flip<00:02:57.159> back<00:02:57.340> and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
curl and I would describe that later on

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.789 
curl and I would describe that later on
the<00:03:12.189> video<00:03:12.430> I'm<00:03:13.299> going<00:03:13.659> to<00:03:13.750> continue<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.469> curl
