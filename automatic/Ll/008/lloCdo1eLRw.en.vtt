clean<00:00:22.660> it<00:00:22.779> later<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.619> then<00:00:24.039> set<00:00:24.789> this<00:00:24.910> a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
clean it later and then set this a

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.540 
clean it later and then set this a
little<00:00:25.210> darker<00:00:25.480> but<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:27.070> you<00:00:27.220> mix<00:00:27.369> this

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
little darker but if you mix this

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.089 
little darker but if you mix this
together<00:00:27.789> it<00:00:28.210> provides<00:00:28.660> good<00:00:29.439> contrast<00:00:29.920> in

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
together it provides good contrast in

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.259 
together it provides good contrast in

imagine this is a pretty good size to

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.340 
imagine this is a pretty good size to
make<00:00:57.549> a<00:00:57.580> sculpture<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:58.360> wanna<00:00:58.720> make<00:00:58.869> it<00:00:59.019> know

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
make a sculpture I wanna make it know

going to take away it's pretty stiff so
we<00:01:10.180> have<00:01:10.440> clay<00:01:11.440> mixed<00:01:11.800> up<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.100> is<00:01:12.310> pretty

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
we have clay mixed up this is pretty

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.530 
we have clay mixed up this is pretty
good<00:01:12.760> about<00:01:13.090> ready<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.420> work<00:01:13.690> with<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:15.540> you're

good about ready to work with and you're

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.170 
good about ready to work with and you're
the<00:01:16.750> in<00:01:16.840> between<00:01:17.200> phases<00:01:17.790> it'll<00:01:18.790> start<00:01:19.030> like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
the in between phases it'll start like

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.270 
the in between phases it'll start like
this<00:01:19.360> just<00:01:19.660> a<00:01:19.780> couple<00:01:19.900> pieces<00:01:20.230> this<00:01:21.010> is<00:01:21.160> some

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
this just a couple pieces this is some

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.100 
this just a couple pieces this is some
old<00:01:21.400> quick<00:01:21.730> if<00:01:21.820> it's<00:01:21.970> marbles<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.900> then<00:01:25.110> so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
old quick if it's marbles and then so

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.930 
old quick if it's marbles and then so
all<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.260> do<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.440> I<00:01:26.650> twist<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.400> or<00:01:27.610> work<00:01:27.760> it<00:01:27.880> around

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
all I do is I twist it or work it around

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.080 
all I do is I twist it or work it around
in<00:01:28.180> my<00:01:28.300> hands<00:01:28.870> until<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.070> becomes<00:01:30.400> kind<00:01:31.060> of

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
in my hands until it becomes kind of

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.090 
in my hands until it becomes kind of
more<00:01:31.270> solid<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.110> then<00:01:32.350> it's<00:01:32.470> easier<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.860> see

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
more solid and then it's easier to see

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.660 
more solid and then it's easier to see
your<00:01:33.970> details<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:34.540> what<00:01:34.659> you're<00:01:34.810> working<00:01:35.080> on

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
your details so what you're working on

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.120 
your details so what you're working on
so<00:01:36.670> keep<00:01:37.030> going<00:01:37.060> until<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:37.900> all<00:01:38.620> of<00:01:38.800> it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
so keep going until I like all of it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.190 
so keep going until I like all of it
each<00:01:39.280> will<00:01:39.460> section<00:01:39.909> looks<00:01:40.090> about<00:01:40.330> like<00:01:40.390> that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.230 

next<00:01:44.200> time<00:01:44.560> for<00:01:44.950> why<00:01:45.190> okay<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:45.580> these<00:01:45.909> are<00:01:46.090> my

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
next time for why okay so these are my

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
next time for why okay so these are my
wire<00:01:46.510> wrapping<00:01:46.810> tools<00:01:47.230> I<00:01:47.650> have<00:01:47.940> ten<00:01:48.940> on<00:01:49.060> medium

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
wire wrapping tools I have ten on medium

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:00.780 
wire wrapping tools I have ten on medium
gauge<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.950> one<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.520> very<00:01:55.240> thin<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:58.360> focus<00:01:59.790> 28

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790

let's<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.100> wire<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.580> pretty<00:02:04.850> flexible

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
let's see a wire it's pretty flexible

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.639 
let's see a wire it's pretty flexible
and<00:02:07.730> then<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.600> use<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> spine<00:02:09.619> I

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
and then this I use for the spine I

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.460 
and then this I use for the spine I
usually<00:02:10.100> cut<00:02:10.310> off<00:02:10.399> about<00:02:12.280> maybe<00:02:13.280> four<00:02:13.550> inches

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
usually cut off about maybe four inches

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.810 
usually cut off about maybe four inches
it's<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.560> little<00:02:15.800> bit<00:02:15.920> flexible<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:16.550> not<00:02:16.640> very

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
it's a little bit flexible but not very

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.380 
it's a little bit flexible but not very
much<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.650> cut<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.740> with<00:02:18.770> these<00:02:19.040> jewelry<00:02:19.970> cutters

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
much I cut it with these jewelry cutters

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930 
much I cut it with these jewelry cutters
you<00:02:20.690> could<00:02:21.680> use<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.860> little<00:02:22.220> bit<00:02:22.340> larger

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
you could use a little bit larger

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.150 
you could use a little bit larger
cutters<00:02:23.150> maybe<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.290> little<00:02:24.470> bit<00:02:24.560> too<00:02:24.740> small<00:02:24.860> for

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
cutters maybe a little bit too small for

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:37.000 
cutters maybe a little bit too small for
this<00:02:25.340> stuff<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:30.220> here<00:02:31.220> is<00:02:32.770> me<00:02:33.770> tag<00:02:35.860> shows<00:02:36.860> you

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
this stuff and here is me tag shows you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.470 
this stuff and here is me tag shows you
the<00:02:37.160> information<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:39.290> think<00:02:39.709> it's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
the information that I think it's

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.190 
the information that I think it's
stiffened<00:02:41.480> pretty<00:02:41.780> thick<00:02:43.810> he'll<00:02:44.810> work<00:02:44.989> it's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
stiffened pretty thick he'll work it's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.370 
stiffened pretty thick he'll work it's
about<00:02:45.500> an<00:02:45.800> eighth<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.130> an<00:02:46.250> inch<00:02:46.340> thick<00:02:46.489> so<00:02:47.380> I'm

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
about an eighth of an inch thick so I'm

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.100 
about an eighth of an inch thick so I'm
gonna<00:02:48.530> cut<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.860> up<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.310> started<00:02:50.110> okay

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
gonna cut that up and get started okay

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.420 
gonna cut that up and get started okay
