00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
gonna need some polymer clay I got mines

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.400 
gonna need some polymer clay I got mines
from<00:00:57.620> Michael's<00:00:58.160> craft<00:00:58.490> store<00:00:59.080> in<00:01:00.080> which<00:01:00.230> give

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.219 
chunk off and you're going to
manipulated<00:01:05.990> or<00:01:06.259> I<00:01:06.979> think<00:01:07.460> clubs<00:01:07.670> needed

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
manipulated or I think clubs needed

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.420 
manipulated or I think clubs needed
needing<00:01:09.229> or<00:01:11.409> massaging<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.530> clay<00:01:12.770> basically

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
needing or massaging the clay basically

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.940 
needing or massaging the clay basically
just<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.909> make<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.420> soft<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.409> this<00:01:15.590> is<00:01:15.650> gonna

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
just to make it soft and this is gonna

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.080 
just to make it soft and this is gonna
make<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:16.729> a<00:01:16.850> lot<00:01:17.030> easier<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.450> work<00:01:17.780> with<00:01:17.840> and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
make it a lot easier to work with and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.380 
make it a lot easier to work with and
just<00:01:20.090> let<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.360> process<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.810> lot<00:01:21.140> faster<00:01:22.390> so

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
just let the process a lot faster so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.970 
just let the process a lot faster so
that's<00:01:23.600> what<00:01:23.720> I'm<00:01:23.780> doing<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.200> can<00:01:24.320> take<00:01:24.560> me<00:01:24.740> be

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
little kind of round worm thing and I'm

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.030 
little kind of round worm thing and I'm
sticking<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.430> inside<00:01:50.150> the<00:01:50.780> tunnel<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.680> I'm

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
sticking it inside the tunnel and I'm

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.789 
sticking it inside the tunnel and I'm
just<00:01:52.190> shoving<00:01:52.490> it<00:01:52.610> in<00:01:52.760> there<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.380> I'm<00:01:54.380> just

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
just shoving it in there and I'm just

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.950 
just shoving it in there and I'm just
trying<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.370> make<00:01:55.820> sure<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.299> fits<00:01:56.659> around<00:01:56.810> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
trying to make sure it fits around the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.690 
trying to make sure it fits around the
tunnel<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.470> I'm<00:01:57.560> getting<00:01:58.070> all<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.400> extra

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
tunnel and I'm getting all the extra

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.149 
tunnel and I'm getting all the extra
parts<00:01:58.850> off<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.270> don't<00:01:59.570> need<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:00.290> now<00:02:00.920> I'm

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
parts off that I don't need and now I'm

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.780 
parts off that I don't need and now I'm
just<00:02:01.190> gonna<00:02:01.520> flatten<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.630> it<00:02:02.930> covers<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
just gonna flatten it so it covers the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.380 
just gonna flatten it so it covers the
the<00:02:05.020> roundness<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.380> tunnel<00:02:06.799> as<00:02:07.269> you<00:02:08.269> can

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
the roundness of the tunnel as you can

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.059 
the roundness of the tunnel as you can
see<00:02:08.539> I'm<00:02:08.659> covering<00:02:08.959> all<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> rhinestones<00:02:09.769> and

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
see I'm covering all the rhinestones and

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.880 
see I'm covering all the rhinestones and
just<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.459> whole<00:02:10.640> top<00:02:11.090> part<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.689> it<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.769> look

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
just the whole top part so it can look

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.149 
just the whole top part so it can look
really<00:02:13.099> nice<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.700> neat<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.420> this<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:15.709> really

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.590 
I'm just getting all the extra access
that<00:02:48.260> actually<00:02:48.740> came<00:02:48.980> off<00:02:49.160> from<00:02:49.850> pushing<00:02:50.510> it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
just rounding the edges so they can be

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.530 
just rounding the edges so they can be
really<00:02:59.660> smooth<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.850> it<00:03:02.000> looks<00:03:02.150> really

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540
