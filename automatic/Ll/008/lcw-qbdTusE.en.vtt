the coach is demonstrating the technical
piece<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> game<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.750> again<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.199> want<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
piece of the game and again you want to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
piece of the game and again you want to
make<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.970> commensurate<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> ability

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
make it commensurate to the ability

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.779 
make it commensurate to the ability
level<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> players<00:00:22.400> you'll<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.609> that

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
level of the players you'll see that

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.150 
level of the players you'll see that
there<00:00:23.939> are<00:00:23.970> small<00:00:24.320> small<00:00:25.320> goals<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.949> gates

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
there are small small goals and gates

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.670 
there are small small goals and gates
within<00:00:26.760> our<00:00:27.060> grid<00:00:27.660> that's<00:00:27.840> now<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> little

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
within our grid that's now just a little

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.279 
within our grid that's now just a little
bit<00:00:28.800> bigger<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.630> foster<00:00:31.050> success

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
bit bigger so that you foster success

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.280 
bit bigger so that you foster success
within<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> game<00:00:32.040> 30<00:00:32.579> yard<00:00:32.880> area<00:00:33.090> 1<00:00:33.989> ball

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
within the game 30 yard area 1 ball

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.130 
within the game 30 yard area 1 ball
between<00:00:34.950> two<00:00:35.370> players<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:36.660> various

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
between two players there's various

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.709 
between two players there's various
gates<00:00:37.950> across<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.930> inside<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.040> grid

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
gates across the and inside the grid

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.900 
gates across the and inside the grid
like<00:00:42.719> Darren<00:00:43.079> says<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.890> gates<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.550> be

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
like Darren says the the gates will be

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.520 
like Darren says the the gates will be
as<00:00:45.000> big<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> feel<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:45.899> need<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.350> or

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
as big as you feel they need to be or

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.979 
as big as you feel they need to be or
small<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.370> need<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.719> players

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
small as they need to be on the players

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.770 
small as they need to be on the players
level<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:50.190> idea<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.120> players<00:00:51.480> pass

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
level the idea here is that players pass

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.119 
level the idea here is that players pass
the<00:00:51.989> ball<00:00:52.140> back<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.379> forward<00:00:52.829> against<00:00:53.010> each

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the ball back and forward against each

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.540 
the ball back and forward against each
other

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
other

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.439 
other
you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.210> various<00:00:55.370> conditions<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> for

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
you can put various conditions on it for

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.119 
you can put various conditions on it for
instance<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:57.930> must<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> ball<00:00:58.620> back<00:00:58.890> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
instance they must get the ball back and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
instance they must get the ball back and
back<00:01:00.059> through<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> gate<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> maximum<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
back through the gate on a maximum of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.759 
back through the gate on a maximum of
two<00:01:02.100> touches<00:01:02.989> exactly<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.530> there's<00:01:04.680> an

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
two touches exactly right and there's an

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
two touches exactly right and there's an
emphasis<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.220> technique<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
emphasis on technique here we want to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.770 
emphasis on technique here we want to
teach<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.110> players<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.310> ability<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.420> pass

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
teach these players the ability to pass

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
teach these players the ability to pass
the<00:01:09.810> ball<00:01:10.200> well<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> coach

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the ball well and you see the coach

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
the ball well and you see the coach
interact<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.270> make<00:01:12.390> sure<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.659> each<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.170> the

interact and make sure that each of the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
interact and make sure that each of the
techniques<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.310> each<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.210> players<00:01:15.540> is

absolutely<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.150> again<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> conditions<00:01:25.830> will

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
absolutely and again the conditions will

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.539 
absolutely and again the conditions will
determine<00:01:26.549> me<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.540> level<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.960> play<00:01:28.549> keep

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
determine me on the level of play keep

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.190 
determine me on the level of play keep
the<00:01:29.670> ball<00:01:29.820> moving<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.689> many<00:01:30.840> touch<00:01:31.049> as

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the ball moving get as many touch as

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.850 
the ball moving get as many touch as
they<00:01:31.320> can

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
they can

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.359 
they can
you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.240> progress<00:01:33.630> again<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.159> first

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you can then progress again to the first

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.969 
you can then progress again to the first
pair<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.329> would<00:01:36.450> get<00:01:36.630> 50<00:01:36.990> passes<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.680> 20

passes or whatever it is you feel would
make<00:01:40.650> sense<00:01:40.829> now<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.640> again<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.060> say<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
make sense now and again and say it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
make sense now and again and say it's
related<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.810> ability<00:01:43.170> level<00:01:43.649> within<00:01:44.399> your

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
related to ability level within your

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
related to ability level within your
group<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> want<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> make<00:01:45.960> sure<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.200> you
