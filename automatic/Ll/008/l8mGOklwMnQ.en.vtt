00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.799
 at the beginning of the game had a bit smaller tasks to do as well 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.609
 a lot of myths or a bit had to watch at the farm at night though 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.340
 Marston is pretty quick then you can do something best that can 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.840
 called 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.890
 Put button 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.390
 League received 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.900
 That also makes months of fairness from Cuenca made trains 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.899
 out without him walking 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.649
 No 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.489
 it is one percent more very clear separation between main and 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.469
 Side missions or is it human warmth Morales wants to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.810
 each other yes there is also a mission and clearly it should bring from next to Sun. 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.249
 can be accepted at any time and remember this time as well 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:46.530
 the main mission to be gambled online 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.060
 both in the sense of later tasks must be done voluntarily 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.740
 not even 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.430
 a which one - and is pointed 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.150
 That's what always annoyed me at Sci Fi was this plane all 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.360
 two minutes left one has his rest in the game very stable with good the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.900
 Founder, however, not yet called 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.450
 exactly 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.530
 he officiates too late, we very much wish for an accident victim in the Civil War 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.890
 burn the houses from other sources 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.830
 that is, even though John Marston is trying to eat a respectable man 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.170
 in order to come into conflict with the law is a single order pictures in the net 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.510
 get your head 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.689
 come what may 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.110
 and the Wienerlied of dirty work for all sorts of parties 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.450
 and yes, too 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.910
 that brings him already some moral dilemma 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.640
 You have to say that they are never really difficult 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.830
 Covering system there is a very very painting is the author 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.480
 and thanks to the medicine and the three features, what will be when you see action 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.670
 where you have slowed down the time marking goals there are virtually none 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.580
 real challenge in this game it's more about atmosphere 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.490
 but this farewell is absolutely exhausted and that's also how the game will arrive 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.090
 which does not record what looks boring or what else 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.780
 One often ripens with people through the opponents Trentmann x 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.080
 and it returned at the same speed and also distracts 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.910
 bit with 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.430
 and you talk to people it is very much slower 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.840
 he looks rather uncool 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.920
 everything is incredible atmosphere I have to say I'm not the one 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.840
 Coast Wild West Club 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.410
 but I'm in a good mood when I had a bit of trouble too 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.259
 My shoulder looked dry and I was really excited about it 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.909
 the cloud of smoke was one maybe too often on the back of 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.109
 Horses on the way or 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.760
 l and then is always quickly ambushed and drove way too often 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.849
 to satisfy one 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.919
 next to long but 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.229
 the atmosphere and the characters and this incredible atmosphere make that 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.479
 The sea will 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.129
 also a beautiful scene almost 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.989
 overpass of the ferry 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.629
 because attacked with the opposing bank so opposite the taint shore and 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.020
 Let's go with the cutter and drive down the "Rio Grande" 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.999
 and there are some highlights I do not even hint at here 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.209
 that Bolt is more so 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.440
 that fits that can users guys lol if necessary 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.519
