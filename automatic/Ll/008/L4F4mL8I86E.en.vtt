00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 first solving expressions 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.410
 numbers with integers 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.349
 first let's take the numbers from 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.839
 parenthesis then brackets after tevez 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:20.100
 negative sign out here exchange all 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.850
 these signs you had a frame 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 positive it turns out to be negative had 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.260
 1 - 5 becomes five more had 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.300
 minus six becomes six more repeats 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.399
 all this part here 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 Now, let's do the following. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.190
 in this negative line before the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:48.210
 chips exchange all internal signals if 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 was - happens to be more if it was more passes 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 to be less if it was - becomes more if 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 it was more happens to be less will be more 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 pass c - now you make that rule 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.530
 explained at the beginning of the video 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.619
 class 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 you have three take two in 11 plus 45 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:24.020
 that here everything will be 5 5 - 500-6 your 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 answer will be minus six 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:34.110
 except that what was done here was taken 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.189
 3 positive and added with the other part 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.470
 positive 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:50.570
 3 plus 47 got all the negatives and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.570
 added should 2 should 5 should 6 should how much 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.280
 13/2 plus five plus 6 13 with the signal 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:08.780
 negative 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:08.780
 You have seven and take 13 636 higher. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.680
 relatively simple but 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.120
 to the rules of signs the person does not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:28.640
 Can make the next bill 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.640
 Do you have brackets and relatives braces?
