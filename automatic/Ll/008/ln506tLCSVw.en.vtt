don't<00:03:00.430> know<00:03:00.579> how<00:03:00.700> many<00:03:00.760> people<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.180> used

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
don't know how many people have used

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.600 
don't know how many people have used
them<00:03:01.600> yet<00:03:02.070> they've<00:03:03.070> been<00:03:03.160> out<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.459> while

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
them yet they've been out for a while

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.539 
them yet they've been out for a while
now<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.209> I'm<00:03:04.299> assuming<00:03:04.480> mr.<00:03:04.840> cool<00:03:05.220> heavily<00:03:06.220> try

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
now so I'm assuming mr. cool heavily try

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.850 
now so I'm assuming mr. cool heavily try
them<00:03:06.850> but<00:03:07.150> uh<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.930> them<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.380> little<00:03:08.650> bit

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
them but uh I like them a little bit

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.199 
them but uh I like them a little bit
touchy<00:03:09.070> when<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.430> first<00:03:09.610> get<00:03:09.760> used<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.090> him

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
touchy when you first get used to him

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.940 
touchy when you first get used to him
compared<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> old<00:03:11.079> pistol<00:03:11.530> grip<00:03:11.680> X

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
compared to like the old pistol grip X

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.819 
compared to like the old pistol grip X
marks<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:13.030> those<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.109> haven't<00:03:14.380> ran<00:03:14.620> one

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
marks but those of you haven't ran one

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.440 
marks but those of you haven't ran one
now<00:03:15.640> obviously<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> key<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.269> your

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
now obviously a key this is this is your

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.910 
now obviously a key this is this is your
gear<00:03:19.750> for<00:03:19.989> forward<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.500> don't<00:03:20.650> actually<00:03:20.739> have

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
gear for forward you don't actually have

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.370 
gear for forward you don't actually have
a<00:03:20.980> reverse<00:03:21.310> gear<00:03:21.450> what<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.930> just<00:03:23.109> if

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
a reverse gear what it is you just if

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.569 
a reverse gear what it is you just if
you<00:03:23.410> want<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> get<00:03:23.739> back<00:03:23.890> you'll<00:03:24.130> pull<00:03:24.370> both

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
you want to get back you'll pull both

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.630 
you want to get back you'll pull both
these<00:03:24.790> back<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.650> then<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.190> let's<00:03:27.370> go<00:03:27.459> back

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
these back and then so you let's go back

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.069 
these back and then so you let's go back
and<00:03:27.820> if<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:27.940> watch<00:03:28.120> thermal<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:28.630> pull<00:03:28.900> either

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
and if you watch thermal you pull either

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.560 
and if you watch thermal you pull either
one<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.650> then<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.549> give<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.790> in<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.970> draw<00:03:31.209> to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
one and then to give it in the draw to

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.180 
one and then to give it in the draw to
get<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.019> go<00:03:32.109> forward<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.530> pull<00:03:32.950> them<00:03:33.040> back

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
get to go forward you pull them back

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.680 
get to go forward you pull them back
just<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.760> little<00:03:34.060> spot<00:03:34.239> where<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.450> feel

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
just like a little spot where you feel

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.630 
just like a little spot where you feel
neutral<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.829> click<00:03:36.040> forward<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.519> let

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
neutral just click forward and just let

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.180 
neutral just click forward and just let
it<00:03:36.760> go<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.780> can<00:03:37.930> essentially<00:03:38.290> like

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
it go and then you can essentially like

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.550 
it go and then you can essentially like
that<00:03:39.400> that's<00:03:39.640> forward<00:03:40.150> as<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.230> are<00:03:41.350> stop

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
that that's forward as you are stop

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.310 
that that's forward as you are stop
you're<00:03:41.799> pulling<00:03:42.070> back<00:03:42.180> turn<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.989> turning

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
you're pulling back turn the turning

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.400 
you're pulling back turn the turning
concepts<00:03:44.769> still<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.070> same<00:03:45.280> as<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.700> old<00:03:46.420> gear

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
concepts still the same as the old gear

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.150 
concepts still the same as the old gear
drives<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:49.269> here's<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.600> 48<00:03:50.109> inch<00:03:50.230> Metro<00:03:50.829> I

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
drives and here's a 48 inch Metro I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.630 
drives and here's a 48 inch Metro I
don't<00:03:51.670> use<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:51.910> at<00:03:52.120> all<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.190> if<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.370> wanted

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
don't use this at all and so if I wanted

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.819 
don't use this at all and so if I wanted
I<00:03:54.730> could<00:03:54.760> try<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:55.209> out<00:03:55.390> it<00:03:56.170> was<00:03:56.290> nice<00:03:56.500> but

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
I could try it out it was nice but

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.080 
I could try it out it was nice but
what's<00:03:57.040> gonna<00:03:57.160> turn<00:03:57.400> tracer

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
what's gonna turn tracer

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.720 
what's gonna turn tracer
this<00:03:58.569> thing<00:03:58.720> sucks<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.470> don't<00:04:00.130> really<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:00.400> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
this thing sucks I don't really like the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.130 
this thing sucks I don't really like the
pistol<00:04:01.090> grips<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.480> if<00:04:01.660> you're<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:01.959> for

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
pistol grips and if you're on it for

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.630 
pistol grips and if you're on it for
like<00:04:02.530> more<00:04:02.769> than<00:04:02.920> an<00:04:03.100> hour

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
like more than an hour

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.030 
like more than an hour
you'll<00:04:04.480> get<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:05.020> little<00:04:05.380> tear<00:04:05.560> up<00:04:05.650> your<00:04:05.680> hands

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
you'll get you little tear up your hands

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.820 
you'll get you little tear up your hands
turn<00:04:06.460> sometimes<00:04:07.050> but<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.080> mean<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:08.710> good

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
turn sometimes but I mean it's good

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.290 
turn sometimes but I mean it's good
starting<00:04:09.310> now<00:04:09.430> or<00:04:09.580> their<00:04:09.700> relatives<00:04:09.880> they're

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
starting now or their relatives they're

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.060 
starting now or their relatives they're
a<00:04:10.330> little<00:04:10.450> bit<00:04:10.600> cheaper<00:04:10.990> than<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.200> Haj<00:04:11.620> that's<00:04:12.010> a

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
a little bit cheaper than a Haj that's a

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.790 
a little bit cheaper than a Haj that's a
hydro<00:04:12.400> walk-behind<00:04:12.760> too<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.260> mean<00:04:14.560> you

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
hydro walk-behind too so I mean you

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.590 
hydro walk-behind too so I mean you
