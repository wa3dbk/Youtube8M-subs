00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.110
 It is very good because we are best 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.110
 here in a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.730
 in a tutorial that I do not usually be 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.230
 tutorial and what do I do gameplays or if 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.430
 they want to see on my channel it's good 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.430
 we put here in flag this is a 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.560
 tutorial on how to make a design for your 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.560
 field and fine 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.710
 and well, here we can coffee 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.220
 so we can coffee and then we put the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.820
 clipper the clipper we put it that way black 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.900
 how is it 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.900
 so we leave it like this 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.109
 Then he knows that he covers half and what 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:50.289
 we put ihcafÃ© coffee of another color 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:54.460
 but it is going to be seen or after we put 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.340
 he who does not cover more than this is his 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.079
 mouth 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.789
 we put red 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.820
 I think it's called molt that we're going to 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.570
 do and then we put what would come 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.899
 being the teeth are white and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.460
 here it is but so you do not see if 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.610
 perfect 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.730
 they put 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.420
 this framework that is here and that framework and 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.060
 puts it in coffee and well well it is already 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.340
 if they are new and do not know how to put the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.580
 pink is copied this link that is that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.260
 they put in copy and then here is not 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.960
 this puts it in the south they put him in paste 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.050
 well and you can already here 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.590
 and already here it will appear 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.690
 and here the layer will appear gray when 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.630
 have it back you will be gray 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.800
 put a shade coffee here that 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.740
 resemble that 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.740
 something like that and also more 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.579
 something like that much like it and well I 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.509
 I have this trick so you do not see if 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:12.270
 I put it who writes and I think it was like that 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.860
 I put it I like it more as it looks 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.130
 because these video forms 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.310
 that's how it looks normal and I like it better 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.180
 we are up and everything like that I have it and 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.620
 here they have to put the name of 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.770
 its minecraft name are in my 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.070
 name obviously but it is an example and 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.450
 then here they will ask for the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.660
 in addition to donation if they are new and not 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.550
 so I put it in cape in layer and I 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.220
 create here what for example puts it the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.740
 steals hotmail had already put it and no longer 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.080
 is my mail obviously I do not know who 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.080
 you could continue 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.920
 and I will upload this option on the internet 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.409
 and let's wait for it to load to load 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.950
 well there was a little bit a little problem 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.860
 I could not do that and I closed the page 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.920
 optimal but that is going to make them 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.090
 personal data and all that and that's how it is 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.020
 as we let this layer dome 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.990
 get me and good 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.360
