00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
scene was amazing I thought it was that

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.970 
scene was amazing I thought it was that
much<00:03:17.599> better<00:03:17.810> than<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.079> previous<00:03:18.439> film<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:18.889> it

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
much better than a previous film but it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.709 
much better than a previous film but it
was<00:03:19.069> kind<00:03:19.280> of<00:03:19.400> close<00:03:19.579> between<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.480> first

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:20.719 
was kind of close between the first

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:22.179 
was kind of close between the first
movie<00:03:21.019> and<00:03:21.229> this<00:03:21.439> one<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.709> see<00:03:21.829> which<00:03:22.009> one<00:03:22.159> I

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
movie and this one to see which one I

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.679 
movie and this one to see which one I
really<00:03:22.250> liked<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.699> most<00:03:22.879> but<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.389> think<00:03:23.569> it's

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
really liked the most but I think it's

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.069 
really liked the most but I think it's
got<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:24.049> transformers<00:03:24.620> 3<00:03:25.189> and<00:03:25.750> real<00:03:26.750> quick
