00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 coral elongata is an algae that abounds 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.950
 much in the intertidal pools where 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.710
 grows right up to the water level without 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.990
 expose themselves never to the fixed air small 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.199
 amounts of calcium to adopt a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.140
 certain hardness of segmented nature 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.140
 as we see in these photographs 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 increased 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.770
 gelidium cesky pedal is a red algae that 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.380
 once used as a fertilizer in the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.900
 orchards and today they are extracted from her 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.450
 numerous cosmetic products for 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.670
 make creams like the agar covers 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.580
 large extensions and supports strong 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.680
 waves when there is a storm at sea is 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.290
 frequent reaching the beaches 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.660
 numerous shrubs of these algae 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.180
 calÃ­pari sicilia is from the arats union 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.400
 lingua tum are two red algae a lot 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.830
 logically very similar both 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.870
 They present flat and fleshy leaves with 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.870
 small generations on its edge 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.450
 The genus Lito films are calcareous algae 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.090
 that they look like scabs with 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.640
 unique formations called coral and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.190
 no geno because its morphology and process 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.620
 of calcification are very similar to 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.200
 of the corals of the tropical seas 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.510
 litho phylum incrust shape crusts 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.730
 roses that cover the interstices and 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.160
 rocky cracks while the landmark 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.010
 filaments a grows in the intertidal 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.590
 exposed adopting an aspect similar to 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.180
 a brain with numerous holes where 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.890
 always harbors some worm 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 mesophile a little today des is another alga 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.170
 calcareous that grows already in the subtidal 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.170
 greater depths preferably in 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.540
 the cracks exposed to currents 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.340
 not bad and in the minute and from your ship 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.340
 Check presents tubular fronds 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.720
 Elastic and spongy is developed in 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.259
 the intertidal exposed 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.970
 to go to the pits gun is a red seaweed 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.170
 similar to a moss that supports well 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.170
 the swells of the waves
