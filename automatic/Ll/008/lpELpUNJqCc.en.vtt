00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
to stress the cells

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.000 
to stress the cells
you<00:01:40.820> could<00:01:40.970> get<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.210> durable<00:01:41.870> or<00:01:42.380> something

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
you could get a durable or something

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.150 
you could get a durable or something
and<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.530> right<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:46.980> actually

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
and if they go right here it's actually

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.420 
and if they go right here it's actually
taking<00:01:47.790> faster<00:01:48.420> than<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.260> sure<00:01:50.220> you're

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
taking faster than this but sure you're

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.190 
taking faster than this but sure you're
fast<00:01:50.730> it's<00:01:50.940> actually<00:01:51.270> ticking

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
fast it's actually ticking

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.130 
fast it's actually ticking
but<00:01:53.799> the<00:01:54.310> game<00:01:54.549> kind<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:55.060> fishing<00:01:55.390> boat

and<00:01:58.940> so<00:01:59.060> fast<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.540> sticking<00:01:59.810> even<00:02:00.170> though

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
and so fast it's sticking even though

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.040 
and so fast it's sticking even though

threw that stone house running queries
as<00:02:04.010> fast<00:02:04.340> as<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.820> going<00:02:05.260> just<00:02:06.260> again

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
as fast as this is going just again

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.500 
as fast as this is going just again
can't<00:02:07.610> handle<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.450> much

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.730 

slavia<00:02:15.510> fiscal<00:02:16.170> pills

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.360 

just<00:02:20.280> woke<00:02:20.520> up

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:38.570 

step<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.540> school<00:02:26.099> get<00:02:27.099> some<00:02:28.049> cobblestone

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.970 

can<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.970> put<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.630> Pistons<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.300> wall

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.309 

deftly<00:02:47.790> sticky<00:02:48.209> pistons<00:02:48.690> East<00:02:48.930> based<00:02:49.170> on

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
deftly sticky pistons East based on

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.650 
deftly sticky pistons East based on
schedule

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:01.420 

distrib<00:02:54.530> food<00:02:54.830> from

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.580 

when<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.030> build<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:03.140> world<00:03:03.439> right

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
when you build this this world right

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.309 
when you build this this world right
here<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.950> sweet<00:03:04.219> sticky<00:03:04.549> piston<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.900> one's<00:03:06.140> an

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
here a sweet sticky piston this one's an

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.059 
here a sweet sticky piston this one's an
orchestra

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.100 

so

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.750 

basic<00:03:17.920> block<00:03:18.130> body<00:03:18.430> better

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
basic block body better

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.869 
basic block body better
right<00:03:20.439> we<00:03:21.439> need<00:03:21.620> only<00:03:21.709> one<00:03:22.129> space<00:03:22.489> in<00:03:22.730> between

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
right we need only one space in between

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.710 
right we need only one space in between
the<00:03:23.239> piston

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.330 

just<00:03:27.380> go

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
just go

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.550 
just go
like<00:03:29.730> this

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
like this

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.929 
like this
so<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:32.920> where<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.189> same<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.670> going<00:03:33.879> to

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
so this is where the same is going to

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:45.740 
so this is where the same is going to
fall<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:35.080> Pistons<00:03:35.470> will<00:03:35.829> take<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.250> from<00:03:36.459> there

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.750 

this<00:03:46.320> box<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.010> redstone<00:03:47.880> wiring

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
this box is the redstone wiring

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.840 
this box is the redstone wiring
our<00:03:49.330> distance

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.180 

12u<00:03:57.660> space

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.220 

this<00:04:04.760> one

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.200 

basically

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.629 

things<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:16.140> this

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
things like this

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.200 
things like this
piston<00:04:18.639> sternum<00:04:19.359> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.950 

that's<00:04:22.569> pretty<00:04:23.199> much<00:04:23.350> bet<00:04:24.160> now<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.389> just<00:04:25.419> make

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
that's pretty much bet now to just make

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.320 
that's pretty much bet now to just make
it<00:04:25.990> beautiful<00:04:26.350> kid<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:27.190> take<00:04:27.490> along<00:04:28.060> take

it beautiful kid you take along take

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.530 
it beautiful kid you take along take
this<00:04:28.539> and<00:04:28.750> show<00:04:29.740> me<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.680> works

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
this and show me the works

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.810 
this and show me the works
when<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.110> piston<00:04:35.500> these<00:04:35.710> persons<00:04:36.160> are<00:04:36.250> on<00:04:36.460> to

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
when the piston these persons are on to

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.350 
when the piston these persons are on to
do<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.630> place<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.110> sand<00:04:38.440> right<00:04:39.070> there<00:04:39.400> right

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
do you place the sand right there right

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.620 
do you place the sand right there right
on<00:04:40.630> this<00:04:40.840> ledge<00:04:41.470> here<00:04:42.120> don't<00:04:43.120> take<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.390> center

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
on this ledge here don't take the center

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.750 
on this ledge here don't take the center
of<00:04:43.720> duplicated

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
of duplicated

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.330 
of duplicated
but<00:04:45.210> this<00:04:45.390> way<00:04:45.630> when<00:04:45.960> this<00:04:46.290> type<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.560> duplicate

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
but this way when this type of duplicate

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.890 
but this way when this type of duplicate
or<00:04:47.370> what<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.670> does<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:48.150> just<00:04:48.180> makes<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> same

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
or what it does it just makes the same

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.820 
or what it does it just makes the same
blocks<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.470> then<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.620> miss<00:04:49.830> them<00:04:50.040> fall<00:04:50.600> down

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
blocks and then I miss them fall down

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.800 
blocks and then I miss them fall down
won't<00:04:52.830> automatically<00:04:53.310> break<00:04:53.640> them<00:04:53.880> but<00:04:54.090> a

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
won't automatically break them but a

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.580 
won't automatically break them but a
technique<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.800> my<00:04:56.340> friend<00:04:56.820> taught<00:04:57.030> me<00:04:57.590> it

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
technique that my friend taught me it

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.400 
technique that my friend taught me it
can<00:04:58.710> place<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> torch<00:04:59.670> below<00:05:00.210> santa<00:05:00.750> gravel

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
can place a torch below santa gravel

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.390 
can place a torch below santa gravel
like<00:05:01.650> this<00:05:03.500> they<00:05:04.500> don't<00:05:04.680> fall<00:05:04.890> down<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.280> break

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
like this they don't fall down and break

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.580 
like this they don't fall down and break
it

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.230 

it's<00:05:09.590> an<00:05:09.710> easy<00:05:10.010> way<00:05:10.160> to<00:05:10.190> get<00:05:10.400> rid<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.610> sand<00:05:11.060> and

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
it's an easy way to get rid of sand and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.230 
it's an easy way to get rid of sand and
gravel

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.089 

so<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:16.310> really<00:05:16.849> actually<00:05:17.180> simple<00:05:18.139> if<00:05:19.039> you
