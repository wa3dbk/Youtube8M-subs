00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi friends from youtube I'm Bruno GimÃ©nez 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.430
 and today I come with a theory of time 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.740
 adventure chapter pilot 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.680
 this theory goes for all the fans of 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.840
 Adventure time one more show for the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.330
 channel dance and for the channel daniel games 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.820
 I loved in this chapter of Bhutan 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.619
 characters the ice cream king the sweet 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.680
 princess end and check and some more than 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.140
 I'm going to name in the pilot chapter it 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.570
 called penn which refers to penn of 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.670
 tom guard I take out my penn theory should 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.309
 be the zombie that appears in panic in the 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.859
 palace party and that also appears 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.560
 in heroes of the rhythm in the chapter 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.480
 pilot end is put the same diver that in 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.760
 the prisoner chapter of love but 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.559
 check does not wear the boots the chapter 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.140
 pilot refers to the chapter 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.930
 prisoners of love if they knew me 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.880
 glad of xd xd of x in pilot appears 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.070
 the cyclops that would appear in prisoners 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.079
 of love there I did not see it in any 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.090
 chapter more will be that it's a character 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.129
 also appears the golden snow that 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.640
 it would appear in thanks and in the intro 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.409
 and surely in some more when I finish 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.420
 says there is a man of fire in his 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.549
 garden and go that is hot is 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.979
 being reference to the fire elemental 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.000
 in pilot glide with the penguins 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.130
 but 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.380
 in prisoners of the end love slips 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.020
 with check the dog instead of the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.760
 sweet princess who is kidnapped in 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.979
 prisoners of love check it says 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.930
 kidnapping to 6 but in reality there are 7 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.110
 it will not be that the shorts will also debut 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.820
 of the king ice cream the battery the bed go 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.369
 I was traumatized with the shorts 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.860
 when the ice king says it's a 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.210
 magic crown that is true so 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.670
 then they did it well 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.190
 so I like hanging Vaart tone when 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.229
 ends transladado marte does not look that 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.330
 huge crater on earth too 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.190
 appears the king of Mars who will know 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.530
 lincoln this would appear in children of 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.360
 mars if you did not see that chapter them 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 I will leave the link in the description of 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.010
 video 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.729
 so they can see it and take their 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.729
 conclusions 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.360
 the old man who steal the diamonds in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.060
 the pilot chapter looks a lot like 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.030
 old sweet kingdom but that since 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.430
