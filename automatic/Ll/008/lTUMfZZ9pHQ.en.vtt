 today we are going to talk 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.789
 of the beauty of our face and I want 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.340
 introduce you to Dr. Adriana Múnera 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.260
 and the doctor natalia correa they are 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.840
 doctors and surgeons specialists in 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.670
 aesthetic medicine would like at once 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.640
 approach them with good questions so that 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.440
 today you go out with those four 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.010
 treatments that will rejuvenate your 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.480
 Doctor Adriana face let's start with a 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.940
 treatment that I find wonderful and 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.710
 is the platelet rich plasma andrea 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 platelet-rich plasma is a 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.760
 very nice treatment because we use the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.160
 Same patient's blood is extracted 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.560
 patient's blood which is between 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.470
 close and the platelets are removed 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.110
 platelets the part that is richer in 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.850
 platelets is the one that we inject and it is rich 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.989
 in growth factors then this 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.800
 will stimulate the production of collagen 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.190
 elastin the skin is more hydrated can 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.230
 Having spots can improve the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 expression line we recommend a 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.500
 session every two or three months for three 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.230
 sessions and then it's done 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.230
 one session every six months or every year 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.060
 as maintenance a beautiful face is what 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.650
 that we pretend today in a bit of everything and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.170
 Dr. Natalia Belt will talk to us 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 of a procedure that is also 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.050
 absolutely successful and it's the micro 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.760
 Hydro abrasion 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.820
 also latest technology for our 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.070
 face is Andrea looks at the micro hydro 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 dermabrasion is the latest innovation in 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.180
 microdermabrasion since it combines 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.280
 simultaneously the diamond tips 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 with the application of medicines according to 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 the needs of each patient this 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.509
 system favors the absorption and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.979
 penetration of medicines at the same 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.590
 time that performs an exfoliation of the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.020
 skin in a reliable safe way and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.869
 precise the results are obvious and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.940
 that translates to a healthy young skin 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.170
 hydrated smoother 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.200
 We generally recommend a session 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.930
 every 20 or every 30 days or so for 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.280
 six sessions and if we combine it with the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.840
 led mask that I will talk more 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 go ahead as the results are 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.400
 excellent today from 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.530
 aesthetic medicine and anti-aging 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.020
 we have a third treatment that is the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.120
 filling of plasma gel or plasma hair 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.010
 you are pioneers in the city and what 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.010
 rich doctor adrián we clarified a little bit 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.310
 of this, it is andrea the filling of 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.190
 Plasma or plasma gel is a treatment 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.410
 which consists again in extracting 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.530
 the patient's blood pass through a 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.930
 spinning process and get everything 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.560
 plasma both rich and poor in 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.180
 platelets this plasma gel what 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.519
 we put in a special equipment that is 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.280
 plasma flame filler this equipment is 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.260
 Make it thicker then 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.989
 it remains in the form of gel because there its 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.480
 name- plasma gel and it helps us 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.120
 Fill spaces like grooves 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.510
 nasogenians we can outline lips 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.940
 Chin nose serves to give volumes of 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.610
 small areas 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.710
 and the important thing is that they do not have any 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.130
 kind of risk because it's a 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.920
 procedure that the same patient is 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.560
 who contributes the material so to speak 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.990
 the duration of the filling is more or 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.050
 less than 3 to 5 months then the 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.110
 patient can be done one session every 3 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.540
 or 5 months for three sessions and then in 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.130
 forward that has a total fixation 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.190
 well as in the area where we work 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.080
 of 25% then the patient know very 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.240
 natural and zadar very well we can with the 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.340
 fourth treatment you do not mention 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.470
 right now Natalia doctor and it's the mask 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.660
 led what's new right now I was 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.840
 looking around the led light was 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.450
 created by the nasa and this therapy what 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.000
 does it work with light energy 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.400
 or led light because what we call the 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.770
 cold light that when combined with the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.620
 chromotherapy with colors will be 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.720
 therapeutic and regenerative effects 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.820
 well this really has two 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.660
 actions an action that therapeutics 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.920
 what it does is decrease acne 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.570
 the spots diminish as the fat in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.340
 the skin and another that is the action 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.810
 cosmetic that what it does is that 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.970
 stimulates the formation of collagen and 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 elastin basically then you can 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.230
 work with various colors as I said 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.450
 Now then there is the blue color 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.940
 blue color what it does is that it decreases 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.950
 or inhibits the bacteria that causes acne 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.360
 then it is very imposed is very good 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.950
 for patients with acne especially in 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.390
 pregnant women that can be done 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.210
 treatment because they can not take the 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.390
 other medicines the color red 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.660
 orange color that serve to perform 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.860
 anti-aging therapy 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.230
 because it stimulates the formation of collagen 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.480
 and then elastin is already hydrated a 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.510
 aspect of rejuvenation the color 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.470
 yellow that is very good for spots 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.930
 mainly the green after 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.050
 patients who have surgeries like 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.330
 the a facelift or blepharoplasty as 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.680
 this treatment is important for 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.090
 rejuvenation for what is day 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.570
 because it will stimulate collagen 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.740
 elastin oxygenates then it will make 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.660
 the skin is more toned 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.180
 then it is an excellent treatment 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.710
 these are only four of the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.389
