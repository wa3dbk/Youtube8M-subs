00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.270
 I'm cooking zucchini made bars 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 like this 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.760
 put water on the stove and as soon as she 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.100
 boil I will add all the right ingredients 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 ta sugar sugar allspice cloves 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.730
 bay leaf and twig fry me up 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 I add sugar 2 teaspoons with a slide 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 one spoon without a hill of salt water I have 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.930
 there is somewhere around 300 grams 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.090
 then bay leaf and allspice 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.580
 about 10 peas 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:59.940
 Clove 45 inflorescences all as soon as 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.269
 boil I put zucchini in there so 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.339
 it's time to add vinegar i'm doing my 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.400
 marinade more saturated add 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.080
 more vinegar to be very good 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 well marinated 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.560
 and so marinade boils friends if 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.970
 Zucchini cut into large then he goes 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.010
 the first place 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.840
 I am going to do everything together first 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.600
 then put the ringlets because 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 that they are a little bit thinner i use 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 young garlic because more 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:39.500
 fragrant its not necessary to clean it 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.479
 you can press a little bit like this 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 so here just snipe zucchini 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.829
 sliced â€‹â€‹sticks and rings 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.320
 I already have about 2 large ones here 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.719
 minutes it's time to add thin 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.719
 sliced zucchini flakes 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.579
 one minute even 30 seconds will be 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.270
 enough because they are very thin 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.840
 sliced and then when you reach same 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.109
 in the winter 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.509
 aldo on the street these zucchini they will 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.790
 a little bit al dente which we should 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.670
 achieve 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.310
 I post it first 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 because they are already beginning 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.650
 quietly change color as soon as i 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.819
 I will fill half a can 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.160
 I will press them and add garlic and sprig 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.020
 thyme 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.020
 then spread the remaining squash and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.970
 pour marinade 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:44.050
 close the jar and put pasteurized 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:50.709
 but in this convection oven for 15 minutes at 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:52.739
 temperature 150 degrees 150 degrees 15 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.739
 minutes 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.360
 15 minutes went by 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.790
 my marinated zucchini in ready now 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.350
 when they cool they can be stored as 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.690
 refrigerator and at room temperature 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.690
