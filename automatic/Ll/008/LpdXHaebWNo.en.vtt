00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
what type of connection I'm running here

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.030 
what type of connection I'm running here
we're<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:37.110> PS<00:00:37.770> Vita

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
we're going to go to the PS Vita

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310 
we're going to go to the PS Vita
connection<00:00:38.460> settings<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.480> as

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
connection settings right here and as

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.170 
connection settings right here and as
you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.710> we're<00:00:41.610> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> take<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> little

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you can see we're going to take a little

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.979 
you can see we're going to take a little
zoo<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.680> says<00:00:43.920> connect<00:00:44.450> directly<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.539> PS

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
zoo in it says connect directly with PS

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.360 
zoo in it says connect directly with PS
Vita<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.800> ticked<00:00:47.219> right<00:00:47.550> over<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.120> so

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
Vita and it's ticked right over there so

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.650 
Vita and it's ticked right over there so
it<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> means<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.210> local

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it just means that it's a local

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
it just means that it's a local
connection<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.620> over<00:00:52.770> Wi-Fi<00:00:53.039> or

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
connection not going over Wi-Fi or

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
connection not going over Wi-Fi or
anything<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.879> fine<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> we'll<00:00:55.320> bust<00:00:55.530> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
anything that's fine so we'll bust up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.720 
anything that's fine so we'll bust up
the<00:00:55.890> Vita<00:00:58.250> right<00:00:59.250> here<00:01:01.039> let's<00:01:02.039> go<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> focus<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the Vita right here let's go to focus a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.899 
the Vita right here let's go to focus a
little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.500> we'll<00:01:04.619> open<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.129> ps4<00:01:05.430> link

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
little bit and we'll open the ps4 link

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.390 
little bit and we'll open the ps4 link
and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.380> choose<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> first

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and then right here you choose the first

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.080 
and then right here you choose the first
option<00:01:08.670> which<00:01:09.060> does<00:01:09.240> remote<00:01:09.540> play<00:01:10.850> since<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
option which does remote play since the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.370 
option which does remote play since the
direct<00:01:12.420> connection<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> won't<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.350> very

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
direct connection it won't take very

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.520 
direct connection it won't take very
long<00:01:15.259> let's<00:01:16.259> take<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.500> couple<00:01:16.680> moments<00:01:18.530> there's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
popped up over there saying I'm

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.999 
popped up over there saying I'm
connected

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.350 

and<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.400> couple<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.820> moan<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.180> say

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
yep there we go so let's head back to

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.940 
yep there we go so let's head back to
here<00:01:31.290> now<00:01:31.830> again<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.560> Hawkeyes<00:01:34.560> or

here now again I don't have Hawkeyes or
I<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.640> 500<00:01:35.909> frames<00:01:36.210> per<00:01:36.390> second<00:01:36.780> but

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I don't see 500 frames per second but

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.499 
I don't see 500 frames per second but
let's<00:01:37.369> take<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.399> look<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> latency<00:01:39.299> let's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
let's take a look at the latency let's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:49.179 
let's take a look at the latency let's
judge<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.899> for<00:01:40.259> ourselves<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:49.020> again

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
judge it for ourselves here now again

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.330 
judge it for ourselves here now again
I'm<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.549> computer<00:01:50.909> um<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.979> can't

I'm not a computer um I you know I can't

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
I'm not a computer um I you know I can't
see<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> five-under<00:01:53.820> frames<00:01:54.000> per<00:01:54.119> second<00:01:54.450> but

to my human eyes this doesn't look like

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.870 
to my human eyes this doesn't look like
this<00:01:59.940> looks<00:02:00.210> almost<00:02:00.450> one-to-one<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.590> can't<00:02:02.220> see

this looks almost one-to-one I can't see

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
this looks almost one-to-one I can't see
any<00:02:03.210> frame<00:02:03.659> difference<00:02:04.080> at<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.319> I<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.950> there

any frame difference at all I know there

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.550 
any frame difference at all I know there
is<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> frame<00:02:06.030> difference<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.409> an

is a frame difference because there's an

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.590 
is a frame difference because there's an

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.490 
using the Vita the controller is not
working<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.090> might<00:03:49.270> be<00:03:49.360> as<00:03:49.420> for<00:03:49.569> Couture<00:03:49.780> so

I am controlling on the Vita so I'm just
gonna<00:03:52.360> play<00:03:52.510> for<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.750> bit<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.080> show<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.440> guys

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
gonna play for a bit and show you guys

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.770 
gonna play for a bit and show you guys
exactly<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.030> possible<00:03:55.239> to<00:03:55.569> place

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
exactly that it is possible to place

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.090 
exactly that it is possible to place
within<00:03:55.959> roleplay<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.500> latency<00:03:56.860> really

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
within roleplay that the latency really

00:03:57.100 --> 00:05:00.100 
within roleplay that the latency really
isn't<00:03:57.310> an<00:03:57.400> issue<00:03:57.519> so

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.010 

so<00:05:01.520> that's<00:05:02.520> about<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:02.790> as<00:05:03.330> you<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.600> see<00:05:03.810> it's

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
so that's about it as you can see it's

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.760 
so that's about it as you can see it's
pretty<00:05:04.560> much<00:05:04.970> one<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.150> one<00:05:06.360> there<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:07.080> no<00:05:07.320> lag

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
pretty much one to one there is no lag

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.340 
pretty much one to one there is no lag
it<00:05:08.610> doesn't<00:05:09.090> affect<00:05:09.330> gameplay<00:05:09.480> at<00:05:09.810> all<00:05:09.960> it's

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
it doesn't affect gameplay at all it's

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.450 
it doesn't affect gameplay at all it's
super<00:05:10.860> fast<00:05:11.900> you<00:05:12.900> know<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.260> is<00:05:13.590> what<00:05:13.890> so<00:05:14.430> many

another<00:06:06.240> downside<00:06:06.480> would<00:06:06.900> be<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.290> guess<00:06:07.560> that

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
another downside would be I guess that

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.520 
another downside would be I guess that
you<00:06:08.910> don't<00:06:09.120> have<00:06:09.270> r2<00:06:09.480> and<00:06:09.750> l2<00:06:09.810> you're<00:06:10.230> forced

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
you don't have r2 and l2 you're forced

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.670 
you don't have r2 and l2 you're forced
to<00:06:10.650> use<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.890> bad<00:06:11.040> touch<00:06:11.310> of<00:06:11.490> course<00:06:12.530> which<00:06:13.530> is

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
to use the bad touch of course which is

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.590 
to use the bad touch of course which is
not<00:06:13.830> you<00:06:14.100> know<00:06:14.130> as<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:14.640> saw<00:06:14.790> there<00:06:14.820> it<00:06:15.150> wasn't

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
not you know as you saw there it wasn't

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.120 
not you know as you saw there it wasn't
really<00:06:15.810> a<00:06:15.900> big<00:06:16.050> deal<00:06:16.080> but<00:06:16.440> you<00:06:16.650> know<00:06:16.800> it<00:06:16.980> takes

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
really a big deal but you know it takes

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.590 
really a big deal but you know it takes
some<00:06:17.280> getting<00:06:17.520> used<00:06:17.550> to<00:06:17.790> and<00:06:17.820> it<00:06:18.000> is<00:06:18.090> easier<00:06:18.540> to

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
some getting used to and it is easier to

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.230 
some getting used to and it is easier to
use<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.900> wii<00:06:19.020> u<00:06:19.370> controller<00:06:20.370> for<00:06:20.760> to<00:06:21.120> have

obvious advantages are you know it has a
