00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
layer flavor not enough just to have

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.370 
layer flavor not enough just to have
gradients<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.599> have<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.870> tie<00:04:33.050> them<00:04:33.229> together

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
gradients you have to tie them together

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.370 
gradients you have to tie them together
and<00:04:34.190> it's<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.460> sauce<00:04:34.729> you<00:04:34.910> need<00:04:35.030> acid<00:04:35.539> you

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
and it's the sauce you need acid you

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.740 
and it's the sauce you need acid you
need<00:04:36.560> a<00:04:36.889> little<00:04:37.400> bit<00:04:37.580> of<00:04:37.639> fat<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.360> know<00:04:38.479> and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
need a little bit of fat you know and

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.240 
need a little bit of fat you know and
and<00:04:39.169> then<00:04:39.289> when<00:04:39.620> they<00:04:39.710> when<00:04:39.949> they<00:04:40.039> tie

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
and then when they when they tie

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.159 
and then when they when they tie
together<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.940> do<00:04:41.060> get<00:04:41.240> these<00:04:41.360> explosions<00:04:42.020> of

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
together you do get these explosions of

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.000 
together you do get these explosions of
flavor<00:04:42.440> that's<00:04:43.250> what<00:04:43.490> makes<00:04:43.639> it<00:04:43.789> memorable
