the<00:00:07.970> idea<00:00:08.970> behind<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.420> program<00:00:09.570> was<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.200> have

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the idea behind the program was to have

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.770 
the idea behind the program was to have
one<00:00:10.530> choreographer<00:00:11.309> study<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.210> same<00:00:12.420> score

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
and create two different interpretations

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.990 
and create two different interpretations

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
number two in C minor when I knew that I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.670 
number two in C minor when I knew that I
would<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.239> creating<00:00:57.480> two<00:00:57.899> works<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> same

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
would be creating two works to the same

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
would be creating two works to the same
score<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.609> wanted<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> find<00:01:00.210> something

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
score I really wanted to find something

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
score I really wanted to find something
that<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:01.289> only<00:01:01.320> loved<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> felt

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that I not only loved but that I felt

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
that I not only loved but that I felt
could<00:01:03.270> hold<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.780> against<00:01:04.229> two<00:01:04.559> different

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
could hold up against two different

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.760 
could hold up against two different
choreographies<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.630> particular<00:01:07.200> piece<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
choreographies this particular piece is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.000 
choreographies this particular piece is
very<00:01:08.760> intricate<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.229> six<00:01:10.530> movements

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
very intricate and it's in six movements

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
very intricate and it's in six movements
so<00:01:11.189> there's<00:01:11.369> lots<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> opportunity<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.659> shade

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so there's lots of opportunity to shade

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.399 
so there's lots of opportunity to shade
the<00:01:13.799> work<00:01:13.979> through<00:01:14.520> various<00:01:14.960> transitions<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the work through various transitions and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
the work through various transitions and
duets<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> solos<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:18.900> focused<00:01:19.320> on

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
duets and solos I really focused on

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.990 
duets and solos I really focused on
creating<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.450> completely<00:01:21.450> separate<00:01:21.780> structure

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
creating a completely separate structure

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
creating a completely separate structure
choreographically<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> classical<00:01:24.869> work

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
choreographically for the classical work

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
choreographically for the classical work
then<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.920> contemporary<00:01:26.340> work<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
then for the contemporary work the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.300 
then for the contemporary work the
classical<00:01:28.170> work<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.560> much<00:01:28.740> more<00:01:29.009> about

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
classical work is much more about

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270 
classical work is much more about
intimate<00:01:30.090> moments<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> duets<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.439> solos<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
intimate moments in duets and solos and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.609 
intimate moments in duets and solos and
the<00:01:32.939> contemporary<00:01:33.270> piece<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.990> about<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.259> group

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the contemporary piece is about a group

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
the contemporary piece is about a group
dynamic<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> group<00:01:35.850> flow<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.450> continues

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
dynamic and a group flow that continues

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.580 
dynamic and a group flow that continues
to<00:01:37.140> move<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.619> offstage

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.289 

in<00:01:41.590> creating<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.310> classical<00:01:42.880> anti

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
in creating a classical anti

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.910 
in creating a classical anti
contemporary<00:01:43.900> work<00:01:44.170> for<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.530> same<00:01:44.710> program

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
contemporary work for the same program

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.430 
contemporary work for the same program
it's<00:01:45.880> been<00:01:46.150> really<00:01:46.330> interesting<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.960> view

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
it's been really interesting to view

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.789 
it's been really interesting to view
them<00:01:47.650> side-by-side<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:49.690> realize<00:01:50.080> what

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
them side-by-side and to realize what

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.649 
them side-by-side and to realize what
within<00:01:51.159> each<00:01:51.310> piece<00:01:51.640> puts<00:01:52.240> it<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.509> that

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
within each piece puts it in that

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.320 
within each piece puts it in that
category<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.950> also<00:01:54.189> at<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.580> same<00:01:54.759> time<00:01:54.820> to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
category and also at the same time to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.789 
category and also at the same time to
realize<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.720> as<00:01:55.990> much<00:01:56.200> as<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.530> try<00:01:56.770> to

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
realize that as much as I try to

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.609 
realize that as much as I try to
separate<00:01:57.580> what<00:01:58.210> contemporary<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:59.289> and<00:01:59.500> what

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
separate what contemporary is and what

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.609 
separate what contemporary is and what
possible<00:02:00.100> is<00:02:00.250> for<00:02:00.280> me<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:02.080> pieces<00:02:02.470> are

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
possible is for me that the pieces are

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.980 
possible is for me that the pieces are
still<00:02:02.860> coming<00:02:03.100> from<00:02:03.490> from<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.240> same<00:02:04.479> place
