00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.390

 pressure shot it made him hot 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.330
 neither cold 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.680
 it's a tough guy the boy put a 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.690
 term to his career on an injury 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.430
 it's really not the kind of house 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.200
 especially if he honors his last 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.660
 year of contract there are 25 million 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.670
 dollars to fetch 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.780
