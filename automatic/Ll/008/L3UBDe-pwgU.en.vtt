 or movie people to reward my name 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.549
 is the table with zy as it approaches 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.740
 to the star wars convention and we're 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.510
 next to see a new trailer we are going to 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.420
 pay homage to this great movie 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.299
 with a list of curiosities and facts 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.900
 interesting about episode 4 a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.900
 new hope 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.220
 one of the most iconic characters in 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.570
 this movie is undoubtedly gioda and what 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.610
 we've seen it go through some 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.140
 physical changes since at the beginning it was 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.720
 as an animatronic then it was 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.280
 computerized but the interesting thing is that 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.760
 the original idea is that outside 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.000
 played by a monkey if a monkey with 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.890
 a mask and a cane that good not 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.960
 they went for that idea 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.970
 the intro of this movie is something that 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.860
 we all remember with the phrase of 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.410
 a lot of time in a galaxy very very 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.649
 distant but what originally was going to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.110
 say it was a long time ago in the future 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.260
 not far which is quite 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 contradictory 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.030
 clear that now we know this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.830
 episode as a new hope without 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.070
 However, I did not really wear it before 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.160
 this title but only star wars 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.770
 but before you even call yourself alone 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.770
 star wars was originally its title 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 the adventures of luke skywalker in the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.850
 Journal of wish and this is not why I 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.850
 generated an image of luke skywalker as 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.119
 but even with the correct title its 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 director george lucas thought that this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.740
 movie to make a tremendous failure and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.799
 that's why he did not even attend the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 premiere but decided to leave 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.899
 trip to hawaii with steven spielberg and it was 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.420
 right on that trip where they were 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.060
 happened to both the history of indiana 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.009
 jones 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.100
 during the production of this movie 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.060
 there was only one ship that was built 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.399
 that was really built and weighed 23 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.740
 tons and it is of course the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.050
 thousand-year-old hawk that I imagine now 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.820
 start something like 30 gigs 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.070
 even though the character of darth 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.920
 vader or darth vader you and of 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.260
 our parents have a huge weight 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.170
 inside this story in this movie 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.270
 it only has 12 minutes of appearance 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.590
 of which probably half of 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.590
 that time is used in it 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.770
 there is a scene in the desert of tunisia 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.500
 in which the character of site is 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.810
 find a great skeleton and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.970
 moment of finishing the filming they decided 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.830
 that the skeleton was like very bulky 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.880
 to be taken for which they left it 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.280
 there and then when filming episode two 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.370
 they returned to that location and there 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 the skeleton waiting to be saved 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.090
 for success that inconsiderate is the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.040
 true 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.510
 on the other hand the character of arthur and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.110
 you whom we know for having a 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.129
 vocabulary as extensive as 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.650
 originally it was planned that the 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.319
 character will speak in English which 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.000
 obviously it was removed but they were left 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.390
 some of the reactions that you 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.849
 he described when he heard his friend speak 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.010
 the subject in a scene 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.379
 develop in a trash compactor 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.260
 the actor mark hamill had to put up 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.230
 both the breathing that burst 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 a vein of the face reason that takes them 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 to that in the following scenes 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.560
 only one angle will be filmed 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.450
 face of the actor and the commented 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.250
 movies this also has errors 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.760
 fun as the moment when the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.299
 stop trooper is in the head I think 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.799
 that extra was quite distracted 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.780
 this fallacy that I wanted to share 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.430
 today in cinema premier in short you
