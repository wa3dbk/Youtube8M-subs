because<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.120> has<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.269> doe<00:00:38.570> foot<00:00:38.840> applicator

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
because it has a doe foot applicator

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.950 
because it has a doe foot applicator
which<00:00:39.680> makes<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.070> easy<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.399> blend<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.840> then

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
which makes it easy to blend and then

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.399 
which makes it easy to blend and then
just<00:00:42.199> use<00:00:42.320> your<00:00:42.440> finger<00:00:43.690> once<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:44.900> blend<00:00:45.199> that

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.100 
I like to sort of keep my eyes a little
bit<00:00:47.809> closed<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.890> few<00:00:49.659> seconds<00:00:50.659> let<00:00:50.930> that

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
bit closed for a few seconds let that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.920 
bit closed for a few seconds let that
set<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:51.890> doesn't<00:00:52.159> crease<00:00:52.399> once<00:00:53.210> that's<00:00:53.479> set

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
set so it doesn't crease once that's set

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.380
