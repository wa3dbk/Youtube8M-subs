00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.970
 Hey youtubers it's Charlie and since Arrow was completely renewed for season 3 start I thought 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.440
 It would be nice to talk about the top 5 stories that they need to adjust from the comic books 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.200
 as well as some of the new characters that they must introduce ... Hint Hint. Ravager 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.630
 and Jericho. 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.930
 Just to clarify though, if I say that was extended early. What that means is that most 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.220
 shows don't get extended until after their season is over. So the arrow fact was retrieved 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.000
 again halfway through the season means the CW has great faith in it. Six 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.560
 Trust seasons and a movie. ha ha. 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.130
 And I said it before, but here's some more proof, Caity Lotz is hanging around. They 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.470
 will be back next season as the canary. So don't be afraid of her death this year. 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.210
 I'll also have to do this same kind of top 5 story video for the flash next week, so 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.330
 if you find me for the first time you can register to get it. 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.580
 So first let's talk about just straight up comedian book titles and then in particular 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.220
 some nice ways they can change things to make them more suitable .. Number 5 - Road To Jericho. 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.580
 This featured The Red Hood, Jason Todd attacks Speedy and Oliver tries to deal with him and 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.930
 eventually it turns into a villain after another tag teaming him including Deathstroke, 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.689
 Merlyn, Brick and Constantijn. At the end of the story, he also ends with the question Black 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.010
 Canary to marry him. 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.160
 There are a few aspects of this they could change. Because many of the batman characters 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.300
 are tied up legally with Fox's Gotham TV show, they could use Slade's son Jericho 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.420
 or even Ravager after Roy come for revenge in the wake of the season 2 final. We don't 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.500
 know what's going to happen this year with character Slade, but it won't finish well 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.910
 for him. He will not die, but he will be beaten hard. 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.470
 I think to bring all the new characters on next year, his children have been the most 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.550
 referred people for the past two years that we have never seen. They would bring it up 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.620
 its a way to Young Justice and ultimately Teen Titans. 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.700
 Number 4 - Sagittarius Quest, who wants to go on a road trip with an oliver? 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.530
 This story is about Oliver reclaiming truly sentimental personal items from all 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.250
 all over the world. Including family items. They did a short team arrow road trip to Russia 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.740
 this season already in a diggle-centric episode, but it would be a good opportunity for a Roy-Oliver 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.460
 Ramblin's man story that let's them travel outside the city. Or they can trade the Roy 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.060
 part for Felicity. Raise your hand if you want to see an Oliver-Felicity road trip 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.979
 Sharing a motel room would cause tumblr to explode (make noise). 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.640
 Number 3 - Hard Traveling Heroes, Green Lantern Crossover anyone? 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.890
 This is also a road trip story, but it is also a green lantern crossover. It's Oliver, 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.530
 Hal Jordan and Black Canary solve problems as they travel through the midwestern Jack Kerouac 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.110
 style. The story was originally from the 70s and is super political, but they could use it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.569
 it as an opportunity to exchange Hal Jordan for Gustin's flash grant. Imagine oliver and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.510
 Barry on a road trip, with some of the comedy arising from the fact that Barry is stuck 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.420
 Traveling at human speeds in a jet when he just could walk much faster. 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.470
 It is unclear how substantial crossovers will be between flash and arrow signs, 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.190
 but it is likely that they will involve large villains. Arrow Road Trip was last year 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.260
 a pseudo suicide command story, so oliver could always participate in a flash villain story. 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.890
 This was also the comic that dealt with Roy's heroin addiction. They sort of done 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.490
 that with the mirakuru storyline, but they could still use the serum as a continuing allegory 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.580
 for addiction. 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.950
 Number 2 - Longbow Hunters. This is where it starts getting dark. 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.640
 Longbow actually features an aging Oliver, which they would have put a little nonsense on, though 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.819
 He tracks down a serial killer while the black canary tries to take a medicine circle. It is 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.739
 the story where Oliver first meets shado, which they should change based solely on 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.640
 her dead creature on the TV show. 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.680
 The reason it is super dark is because Oliver ends up killing one of the villains he finds 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.709
 torture Black Canary. Arrow sort of did this during season 2 when count was vertigo 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.599
 is going to inject Felicity with the mirakuru serum. So technically the TV version of oliver 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.380
 is already gone in this territory. 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.390
 Some changes that they could make would be again, swapping the shado character for ravager or 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.310
 even Sin that should have a slightly bigger role next year. They could even trade 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.819
 oliver and rolls of black canaries. 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.129
 Remember, she's just out of the killers' competition, so she hasn't pacified herself 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.239
 in the way oliver is trying this year. Remember he is all about not killing people 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.280
 more, but that is still something Sara has to do. 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.069
 Number 1 - Cry For Justice. This is a long shot, but it is such an epic story it must be 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.300
 called. 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.120
 Oliver actually goes nuts in this story after Prometheus chops roy's arm off and eventually 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.390
 results in the autumn of green arrow storyline. It is a story about how oliver is undone 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.599
 as a person after his family and his team have been decimated. 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.050
 Right now they are sort of teasing this with storyline Slade in the current. Slade 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.349
 is going to try and destroy oliver's life by destroying everything he loves. 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.739
 What they could do would be really epic with oliver sticking the line a bit 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.129
 go after villains and have Amanda Waller send the suicide command to stop him. It would 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.970
 its like the government going after team arrow with their own team of supers. 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.849
 I don't think they do a story that dark, but it would be great to see Amanda 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.879
 Waller and oliver go one after the other. 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.999
 That being said, here's a bonus choice because arrow is also borrowing stories 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.729
 from the Batman universe and already about the largest DC Universe. Kingdom Come. To think 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.029
 it like as a dc version of days of future past. 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:33.900
 You could even lead to a practical time travel aspect to the story via the flash and the STAR 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.330
 LABS technology. Maybe a little more technical than the cosmic treadmill, but it would just be 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.370
 is a story where your oliver tries to prevent a much darker timeline from actually happening. 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.979
 It would even be a way to kill an important character such as Felicity or Thea or even Oliver himself. 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.669
 And then everything can be resolved by the end as if nothing bad ended. 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.349
 Now it's your turn, which DC story you want to see arrow do next year. 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:02.349
 Next week I'm going to do my top 5 new characters arrow to enter. Make sure you subscribe 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.110
 to get it. 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.669
 Remember, Valentine's Day I place Hannibal season 2 and supernatural season 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.009
 10 videos. it's going to be a nice weekend.
