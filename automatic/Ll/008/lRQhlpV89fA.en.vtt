00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.880
 when we're fine, I'm in the creation of the institute's head 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.920
 and again a meeting here for another video lesson 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.350
 this work that is to see beyond the eyes here by the site www point each and 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.769
 have control of br 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.189
 in the last video lesson 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.259
 I had been talking about some important aspects to be noticed 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.599
 in relation to the leaves 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.250
 and the differences 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.319
 it is not in creating these characteristics that leaves 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.179
 of plants present 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 I finished that video-lesson talking about the lemon grass 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.850
 that I am now returning a little bit in her in that plant that is the grass 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 It looks like a cinder block. 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.970
 beyond the video 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.110
 and remember that I mentioned the characteristics of the fauna - photo to 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.460
 out of the lemongrass grass is longer pointed with those edges 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.319
 sharp 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.759
 the lemon grass to be born many or many small 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.040
 tomorrow manifesting 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.790
 was also in the characteristic of the perfumer of that perfume and citric 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.780
 near the zsee that reminds me a bit and a lot for that reason even association with a 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.360
 of popular names 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.310
 in this plant that is lemongrass I will speak a little about the potentials 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.210
 medicinal plants of this plant to know 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.550
 to the cidreira grass is a natural tranquilizer 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.009
 it has a vasodilatory action 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.420
 the serene muscle relaxation also bells we perform a juice for example with 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.310
 these leaves 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.950
 on managing showed refreshing juice 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
 also in this case it is not 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.290
 for zito legal actions and it is not he can also with this folia 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.150
 being carried out is a maceration 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.840
 the cataplasm for example clustered is applied 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190
 to act in situations of muscular pain she has this potential 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.130
 anesthetic 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.230
 wish is so be talking about this plant 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.290
 entering into an aspect the given popular knowledge about it 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.760
 was often confused with lemon balm herb 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.100
 however it is not the same plant it considers already has other 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.729
 features and left 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.079
 already shows characteristics well to alert grass civilians and to the question of 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.950
 same name is for the perfume and the aroma 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.890
 of the cidreira grass that is nearby 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.019
 the true dampener damp also emergency calls 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.580
 move you to a proximity in this photo 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.039
 of the lemon grass that I show in the background this photo has 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.719
 another plant 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.469
 that he is now appearing more visibly on the screen 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.209
 which is the 'leaf' of fortune exactly because I was talking about the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.569
 characteristics of the leaves and supported different fortune given lemon grass 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.819
 already has the most winding edges is not all her bells and we went to charge her 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.020
 let's realize 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.020
 enough this mold feature also performs 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.570
 those celebrated in the piglet gave me the cookie I said 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.819
 but videolan the pastes né 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.010
 the bag flap has that filling feature that the call 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.280
 succulent at the time as born in its interior 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.970
 this was the one of fortune also presents this same characteristic if we 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.049
 take her 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.819
 massera armos multiply this revelry let's observe there how it accumulates 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.450
 Water 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.489
 inside and this exit 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.870
 that leaves this folia of the fauna of the fortune is very beneficial for example to be 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.329
 applied in eye retractions in conjunctivitis 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.849
 in situations associated with vision that can be applied directly 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.730
 and on the eyes to treat 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.499
 these situations she has several other powers also anesthetic 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.219
 the bet that aims to leave the country too 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.159
 is the most used mainly this action that I quoted in relation to the 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.229
 eyes right 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.659
 I'll move on to 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.909
 such closeness now 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.509
 I spoke given it was that of fortune which is a known plant 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:58.539
 to act placed like a weed see how often 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:02.220
 it is erroneously stated that the plant 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.680
 in this way without perceiving it more deeply open showing another 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.819
 was here and the very popular well-known mint 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.429
 in the much cultivated in brazil 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:16.039
 and that citing in relation to the perception of the leaves something quite 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.449
 interesting 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.230
 to be observed the following there are leaves 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.250
 Are they bigger in this one? 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.639
 visible to be perceived high qi né beyond vision 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.200
 It is the case of ford fortune as I mentioned the case 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.040
 the one of the lemon grass already the mint already has sheets mothers ronnie wood signs 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.099
 minors 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.969
 and often with the toró that is not so bad visible so in observation 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.050
 the edges of the foliage 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.639
 but something that can be done that consumption to realize enough 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.669
 is to raise aside the sides and pass 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.310
 she delicately on the lips is not the full extent covers the banks of the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.029
 revelry 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:55.819
 and with that 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.360
 this perception 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.289
 is this understanding of how these edges gets a bit gets a lot more 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.099
 visible is much calmer 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.849
 Of course, in order to do this, you must first observe 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.999
 if the revelry does not have sharp edges it does not have that those grounds 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.659
 né the prickly so long the edges 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.169
 like the lemongrass grass like a wafer I said in the last 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.569
 video lessons né 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.729
 and after observing it, it can quietly lead to his mouth and he 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.020
 realized more deeply see how our whole body 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.220
 it's perception 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.610
 not only the hands 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.470
 so I'm dated every extension of our body 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.419
 expressed sensitivity 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.099
 the technical mint and went quite 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.050
 been monitored 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.520
 given or refreshing ti is a plant very used to treat 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.090
 the airways 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.129
 agripino 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.080
 the inspector before the natural tranquilizer also 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.710
 and is well-known for being a natural vermifuge 'mainly in 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.470
 relationship 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.439
 the action is empty state diary 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.929
 was talking about this issue of the medicinal principles of plants that 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:00.770
 Pretty much this class video site 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.060
 For you want to delve into this question you can accomplish our 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.850
 course 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.920

 it will have a fairly wide possibility 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.279
 and to deepen the use of medicinal plants 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.940
 for therapeutic purposes 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.719
 for treatment of animals 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.870
 the application of plants in the treatment of other plants 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.360
 this from the perspective of the indigenous herbal medicine of the popular medicine ' 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.030
 of oriental- 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.439
 we go in too 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:36.330
 important aspects 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.050
 given the study of general botany in the then very broad course is in which 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.960
 you go deeper into this universe so gigantic that it is the 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.300
 use of medicinal plants 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.860
 I find myself finishing another video lesson I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.419
