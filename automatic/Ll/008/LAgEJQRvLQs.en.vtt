00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.340
Hi guys! Whats up ? Well...

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.919
this tip today is about Google Chrome

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:12.089
...

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.960
and also works in Firefox browser, but only changed some parameters and

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.619
commands. Chrome plugins are given other names.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.409
the part where the change is made

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.050
With open Chrome, we access the "Settings" menu in the part where the change will be made

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.029
those

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.019
3 bars on the top right

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.680
settings

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.920
we will make sure

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.730
an option

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.310
"Show advanced settings"

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.620
...

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.810
Leave the option activated "use hardware acceleration when available"

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.520
but

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.609
come on

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.460
do the following

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.430
"about:

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.230
//gpu ... (enter) to confirm 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.300
we saw that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.330
in my case we have only two options that are not

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.450
It is used to make hardware acceleration. To enable this process

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.409
"hardware acceleration in Chrome"

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.590
let's do this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.750
We will open a new tab

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.630
"about:

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.430
//flags

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.440
ok

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.850
on the "replace the software rendering list"

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.039
let's enable this option

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.440
activated with it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.000
we close the Chrome browser

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.680
and open again

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.170
and we will see even if it will force hardware acceleration

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.600
which will improve browser performance

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.230
"about://gpu"

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.630
and certify that're all enabled functions

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.130
all video components, decoder, texture sharing

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
Flash 3D, WebGL

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.289
generally these here

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.949
They work very well in Google Maps

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.239
than the defaults.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.880
Some tests on Youtube and gave some improvement

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.189
both Nvidia driver

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.049
as in the Intel driver

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.419
OK guys, any question

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.319
I believe it will run smoothly. I tested on Ubuntu 13.10

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.279
and also in 12.04.. both worked =D
