close enough just make sure not to take
too<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:30.780> damage<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.470> result<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> some

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
too much damage or could result in some

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
too much damage or could result in some
kills<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.549> opponent<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.960> your

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
kills for your opponent and if your

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.420 
kills for your opponent and if your
opponents<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.650> respond<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.220> fight

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
opponents do not respond to your fight

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.550 
opponents do not respond to your fight
attempt<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.479> run<00:01:36.600> away<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.140> means

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
attempt and they just run away it means

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.050 
attempt and they just run away it means
the<00:01:37.680> gank<00:01:37.860> path<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.250> warded<00:01:38.610> or<00:01:38.729> you're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the gank path is warded or you're

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490 
the gank path is warded or you're
already<00:01:39.329> ahead<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.780> lane<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> should<00:01:40.409> be

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
already ahead in lane so you should be

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.960 
already ahead in lane so you should be
playing<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:40.920> aggressive<00:01:41.340> regardless<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
playing more aggressive regardless of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.899 
playing more aggressive regardless of
gang<00:01:42.119> presence<00:01:42.479> anyways<00:01:42.979> in<00:01:43.979> addition<00:01:44.310> you

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
gang presence anyways in addition you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.580 
gang presence anyways in addition you
should<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.360> wait<00:01:45.780> for<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.079> allies<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> are

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
should not wait for your allies that are

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
should not wait for your allies that are
ganking<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.130> initiate<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> fight<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.540> will

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
ganking to initiate the fight they will

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
ganking to initiate the fight they will
have<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.770> distance<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> cover<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
have way too much distance to cover and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.969 
have way too much distance to cover and
unless<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.689> player<00:01:51.899> ganking<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.740> sets

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
unless the player ganking for you sets

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
unless the player ganking for you sets
up<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> flank<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> opponents<00:01:54.570> were

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
up a flank because the opponents were

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
up a flank because the opponents were
heavily<00:01:54.869> extended<00:01:55.500> them<00:01:56.189> initiating<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.000> not

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
heavily extended them initiating is not

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.600 
heavily extended them initiating is not
going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> work<00:01:58.049> as<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.009> opponents<00:01:59.369> will<00:01:59.460> have

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
going to work as the opponents will have

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.999 
going to work as the opponents will have
too<00:01:59.880> much<00:02:00.060> space<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> disengage<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.680> need

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
too much space to disengage so you need

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.560 
too much space to disengage so you need
to<00:02:02.189> start<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> fight<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:03.000> your<00:02:03.119> opponents

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to start a fight with your opponents

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230 
to start a fight with your opponents
before<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.170> gank<00:02:04.409> starts<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.219> your<00:02:05.880> opponents

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
before the gank starts if your opponents

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
before the gank starts if your opponents
are<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.630> far<00:02:06.869> overextended<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.950> set

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
are so far overextended that you can set

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
are so far overextended that you can set
up<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> flank<00:02:08.580> then<00:02:08.819> yes<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.420> person<00:02:09.810> ganking

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
up a flank then yes the person ganking

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
up a flank then yes the person ganking
can<00:02:10.379> initiate<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.009> fight<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.790> usually<00:02:12.300> that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
can initiate the fight but usually that

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.280 
can initiate the fight but usually that
isn't<00:02:12.870> really

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
isn't really

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.009 
isn't really
going<00:02:13.469> to<00:02:13.560> happen<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:15.030> yeah<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:15.750> that
