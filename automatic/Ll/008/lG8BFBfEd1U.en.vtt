00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
lot of fun you know it's a shame I think

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.699

if<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.160> go<00:02:30.820> out<00:02:31.030> for<00:02:31.480> another<00:02:31.660> run<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.380> really

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
if I go out for another run if I really

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.990 
if I go out for another run if I really
push<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.730> could<00:02:33.910> squeeze

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
push it I think I think I could squeeze

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.970 
push it I think I think I could squeeze
a<00:02:34.180> little<00:02:34.600> more<00:02:34.780> but<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.410> was<00:02:35.530> good<00:02:35.680> very

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
a little more but that was good very

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.100
