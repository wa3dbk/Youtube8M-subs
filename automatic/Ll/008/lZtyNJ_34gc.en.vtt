yeah I mean but the way that just just
doing<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> terraforming<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> way<00:00:19.920> we've

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
doing the terraforming the way we've

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.700 
doing the terraforming the way we've
done<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.779> instead<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.960> having<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.380> sort<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.590> in

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
done it instead of having it sort of in

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.859 
done it instead of having it sort of in
a<00:00:23.160> grid-based<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.269> draw<00:00:24.510> into

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
a grid-based then you can just draw into

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.839 
a grid-based then you can just draw into
it<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.039> pretty<00:00:26.490> patterns

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it and you can make the pretty patterns

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.730 
it and you can make the pretty patterns
with<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> tools<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.720> things<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.560> it's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
with all the tools and things but it's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.640 
with all the tools and things but it's
it's<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.160> lot<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.550> then<00:00:29.699> save<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:31.050> hang<00:00:31.529> on

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it's a lot to then save out and hang on

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.040 
it's a lot to then save out and hang on
to<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lot<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> work<00:00:32.460> went<00:00:32.640> into<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.540> huge

128 megabytes cartridge it's it's the
biggest<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.630> said<00:01:09.900> there's<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> lot<00:01:10.350> of

biggest thing that said there's a lot of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
biggest thing that said there's a lot of
FMV<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.979> there<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.310> takes<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
FMV in there which takes up a lot of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.250 
FMV in there which takes up a lot of
space<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> lot<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> very

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
space on there we have a lot of very

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.679 
space on there we have a lot of very
high<00:01:13.409> quality<00:01:13.439> audio<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> only

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
high quality audio as well the only

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:16.789 
high quality audio as well the only
thing<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.020> didn't<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
thing that we didn't get in with the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.160 
thing that we didn't get in with the
paper<00:01:17.040> texture<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> face<00:01:18.090> x<00:01:18.299> safer<00:01:18.659> it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
paper texture on the face x safer it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
paper texture on the face x safer it's
just<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.710> feasible<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> ass<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
just not feasible in the ass but you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
just not feasible in the ass but you
know<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> would<00:01:21.360> be<00:01:21.420> does<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.380> thing<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.979> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
know it would be does the one thing if I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
know it would be does the one thing if I
could<00:01:23.250> change<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.700> word<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.330> people<00:01:24.810> although

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and we're doing that for a reason we

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.590 
and we're doing that for a reason we

we think it appeals to a very wide range
of<00:02:00.119> people<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:00.840> different<00:02:01.079> reasons

it's<00:02:03.750> very<00:02:04.469> kiddy<00:02:04.740> looking<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it's very kiddy looking but it's got a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510 
it's very kiddy looking but it's got a
huge<00:02:05.969> depth<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.479> gameplay<00:02:07.009> there's<00:02:08.009> an<00:02:08.129> awful

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.270 
for ages and we think it can actually
mix<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.540> lot<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.810> people<00:02:16.960> my<00:02:17.410> wife<00:02:17.620> plays<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.100> she

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030

for<00:04:16.530> us<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:16.769> making<00:04:17.160> sure<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.789> we<00:04:18.449> had

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
for us is making sure that the we had

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.180 
for us is making sure that the we had
the<00:04:18.690> controls<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.350> skating<00:04:19.769> feeling

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
the controls in the skating feeling

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.080 
the controls in the skating feeling
authentic<00:04:20.910> similar<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.049> original<00:04:22.139> skate

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
authentic similar to the original skate

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.180 
authentic similar to the original skate
and<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.660> know<00:04:24.780> after<00:04:24.900> several<00:04:25.620> iterations<00:04:25.740> we

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
and you know after several iterations we

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.250 
and you know after several iterations we
hit<00:04:27.180> on<00:04:27.270> something<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:27.870> think<00:04:28.020> works

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
hit on something that we think works

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.960 
hit on something that we think works
really<00:04:28.349> well<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.460> we've<00:04:29.610> decided<00:04:29.699> to

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
really well and so we've decided to

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.790 
really well and so we've decided to
bring<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.240> over<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.479> platforms<00:04:31.020> ok<00:04:31.260> so<00:04:31.590> I'm

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
bring it over to platforms ok so I'm

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.379 
bring it over to platforms ok so I'm
explain<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.340> us<00:04:32.400> how<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.760> how<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.060> does<00:04:33.180> work

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
explain to us how it is how it does work

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.740 
explain to us how it is how it does work
really<00:04:33.630> well<00:04:33.840> with<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.110> Wemo<00:04:34.380> on<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:35.070> we

really the main the main thing is this

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.890 
really the main the main thing is this
is<00:04:38.400> your<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.849> wiimote<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.330> your<00:04:39.479> skateboard

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
skateboard so to tilt the wiimote left

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.920 
skateboard so to tilt the wiimote left
and<00:04:46.620> right<00:04:47.060> allows<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.180> to<00:04:48.270> steer<00:04:48.840> your

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
skateboard just like in real life if you

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.300 
skateboard just like in real life if you
want<00:04:51.360> to<00:04:51.419> ollie<00:04:51.599> lift<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.320> wiimote<00:04:52.650> up<00:04:52.860> and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
want to ollie lift the wiimote up and

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.580 
want to ollie lift the wiimote up and
and<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.700> skater<00:04:54.970> will<00:04:55.180> do<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.420> same<00:04:55.590> manual

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
and the skater will do the same manual

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.530 
and the skater will do the same manual
tilt<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:57.100> back<00:04:57.280> nose<00:04:57.640> manual<00:04:57.940> tilt<00:04:58.330> it<00:04:58.510> forward

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
tilt it back nose manual tilt it forward

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.750 
tilt it back nose manual tilt it forward
etc<00:04:59.380> etc<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.830> it<00:05:00.010> all<00:05:00.160> falls<00:05:00.400> out<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.610> there

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
etc etc so it all falls out of there

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.390 
etc etc so it all falls out of there
with<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.600> d/s<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.890> little<00:05:03.070> different<00:05:03.190> we

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
with the d/s it's a little different we

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.290 
with the d/s it's a little different we
knew<00:05:03.490> we<00:05:03.580> wanted<00:05:03.700> to<00:05:03.850> use<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.090> stylus

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
knew we wanted to use the stylus

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.090 
knew we wanted to use the stylus
controls<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:08.680> know<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.890> touch

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
controls and so you know the touch

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.740 
controls and so you know the touch
screen<00:05:09.250> on<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.580> bottom<00:05:09.730> allowed<00:05:10.210> us<00:05:10.390> to<00:05:10.420> do

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
screen on the bottom allowed us to do

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.450 
screen on the bottom allowed us to do
mimic<00:05:11.320> some<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.740> gestures<00:05:12.130> from<00:05:12.280> the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
mimic some of the gestures from the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.040 
mimic some of the gestures from the
original<00:05:12.850> skates<00:05:13.120> Flicka<00:05:13.420> system<00:05:13.900> but<00:05:14.020> also

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
original skates Flicka system but also

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.960 
original skates Flicka system but also
refine<00:05:14.830> them<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.130> bit<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.430> make<00:05:15.580> them<00:05:15.760> feel<00:05:15.910> a

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
refine them a bit and make them feel a

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.820 
refine them a bit and make them feel a
bit<00:05:16.150> more<00:05:16.300> authentic<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.960> how<00:05:17.470> your<00:05:17.680> weight

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
bit more authentic to how your weight

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.870 
bit more authentic to how your weight
shifted<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.310> board<00:05:18.580> and<00:05:18.700> how<00:05:18.820> you

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
shifted on the board and how you

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.580 
shifted on the board and how you
actually<00:05:19.120> do<00:05:19.360> those<00:05:19.510> moves<00:05:19.690> in<00:05:19.870> real<00:05:20.020> life<00:05:20.140> ok

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
actually do those moves in real life ok

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.650 
actually do those moves in real life ok
I'm<00:05:21.070> assuming<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.670> you<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:22.210> use<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.630> a

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
I'm assuming that you you use the a

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.390 
I'm assuming that you you use the a
button<00:05:23.020> on<00:05:23.170> the<00:05:23.380> on<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.620> wiimotes<00:05:24.040> kind<00:05:24.340> of

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
button on the on the wiimotes kind of

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.650 
button on the on the wiimotes kind of
move<00:05:24.610> forward<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.240> sort<00:05:25.420> of<00:05:25.450> thing<00:05:25.510> I'll

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
move forward and that sort of thing I'll

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.180 
move forward and that sort of thing I'll
do<00:05:25.720> you<00:05:25.780> just<00:05:25.990> how<00:05:26.290> do<00:05:26.350> you<00:05:26.500> move<00:05:26.620> for<00:05:26.890> that's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
do you just how do you move for that's

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.260 
do you just how do you move for that's
all<00:05:27.280> right<00:05:27.370> your<00:05:27.520> push<00:05:27.730> button<00:05:28.030> is<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> a

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
all right your push button is the a

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.210 
all right your push button is the a
button<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.930> B<00:05:29.050> button<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.440> your<00:05:29.950> grab

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
button and the B button is your grab

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.610 
button and the B button is your grab
button<00:05:30.550> so<00:05:30.760> we<00:05:31.000> do<00:05:31.240> use<00:05:31.360> those<00:05:31.480> buttons<00:05:31.780> and

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
button so we do use those buttons and

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.200 
button so we do use those buttons and
this<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.070> believe<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.370> city<00:05:33.580> has<00:05:33.760> changed<00:05:34.120> a
