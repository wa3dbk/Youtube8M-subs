00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.930
 today the head of engineering module and has brought us to honduras but 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.510
 one is a communal gas here is where we do the picops tests with 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.480
 weight we'll try the trailer the airplane 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.180
 that's the best way to avoid the rolling of the trailer is to load it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.210
 correctly 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.530
 but we are doing it incorrectly to demonstrate the balance system of 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.219
 trailer 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.000
 that integrates ford wolf and show how that new terna helps 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.240
 saw a huge trailer a few minutes ago that are going to be 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.460
 the trailer we will use to be a situation in vila-real 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.180
 will go to the color vehicle 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.580
 passed and the driver of the pick-out with the trailer will stop accelerating to 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 induce the balance yao and enough let's look 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.980
 kill and explain me again but from a technical point of view we just 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.610
 to see 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.240
 because it has a trailer balance control system has said 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.030
 the best way to control the rolling of the trailer through braking 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.030
 asymmetric is to say 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.110
 mind somewhere else two recovered quickly because the four wheels 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.000
 braking at the same time 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.310
 correct the vehicle stops more quickly but there is no 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.439
 it's like that 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:11.389
 which says if we walk towards the clear horizon 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.790
 I just want to see if you can really walk on the water the engineers 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.909
 we can birds and as it explains is that I do it
