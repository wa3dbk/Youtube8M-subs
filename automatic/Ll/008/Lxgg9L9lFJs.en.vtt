00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.040
 by curd i'm on the photokina 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.360
 preview in hamburg and we'll take a look 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.340
 a few things to the now soon 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.620
 to be presented in Cologne a few 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.420
 we can already see that 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.130
 unfortunately relatively little than most 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.779
 Exhibitors still want their secrets 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.189
 keep it to yourself but scooter is here 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.330
 and they have some nice gadgets 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.650
 while I had some time ago the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 only 50 tested was not quite so 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.740
 satisfied with what was difficult and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.539
 this also failed 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.859
 Scooter has learned anyway, I believe 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 that you have a few things with you 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.640
 really worth a closer look 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.700
 but first of all catch fun with it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.390
 things and a safestick frequently 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.399
 are in the trend 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 and i can stick with a specific one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.090
 where I can enter every smartphone 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.800
 no matter which inch bigger has me 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.469
 I can not photograph myself 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.079
 press up on the display or on 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.309
 the trigger button that phones but me 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.510
 I connected here via bluetooth 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.510
 to serve one 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 that means I can even do that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.510
 still sharp after regulate and 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.530
 this is very handy for me 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.120
 to take pictures yourself 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 but also very handy around 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 possibly in concerts or when 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.030
 you can not get pictures anywhere 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 make us happy to talk to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
 different colors frosted to 54 euro 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.600
 nice accessory can be purchased must 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.850
 you do not buy what you have to buy 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.880
 are other things if you are when 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 man action athlete also has a role to play 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.520
 really learned and indeed there is 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.229
 for example, a new series of sex and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.590
 the s7 is an action camera 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.329
 is fully equipped with a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.700
 Display that I can take off with one 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.689
 The housing is waterproof with all 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.799
 funny a detachable microphone access 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.150
 so I somehow not 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 But the camera from Koppl has to be turned on 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.049
 Microphone on condition I have a camera 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.090
 win the only distinction 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.000
 between s6 and s7 is actually that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.829
 the s 7 4 k can open in 15 frames 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 is not fluid but for now 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.530
 timelapse recordings really 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.009
 excellent 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.270
 the big one costs 299 the smaller 249 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.740
 so if i have four cables now i have to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.460
 but hold in beuel grab but the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.020
 equipment is must truly phenomenal 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.040
 I do not have to say roller 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.330
 hide behind group on the contrary 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.610
 The price is much better 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.800
 but roll knows the wholesale of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.150
 market leader is and has a device 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.160
 I brought what I personally especially 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
 think great 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.520
 namely the hedgehog is has 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.570
 strange and looks now too 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.360
 looks a bit strange know 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.820
 like a fishing rod but the clou is the one 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.140
 clou is in this sky 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.730
 this is a doctor eddie campbell had 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.620
 the first time heard of it as star 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.210
 That's why this motorcycle race was made 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.950
 has been expensive equipment large 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.920
 chamber on it just do not make a move 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.660
 and this is quite funny lying 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.000
 with the camera tackles it 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.680
 would be on the table for calibration 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.630
 wait instantly and now no matter how I do 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.150
 the camera content and pivot 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.010
 she always stays in position just for 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.040
 fast movement is fantastic 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.360
 i can do an action sequences and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.459
 the chamber always stays in the right place 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.790
 position as well as you really too 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.410
 the recording expects this one 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.090
 handle is removable so i can open it up 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.040
 each tripod in length or on one 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.800
 mount for my bike or motorcycle 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.769
 on the helmet and that's it really 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.780
 a great recording 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:18.100
 exclusively for the moment the gopro hd 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.540
 series the series also costs so around the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.340
 300 euros but I think so just when 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.709
 An ambitious company is everyone 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.989
 worth the euro 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.269
 what is still there is the very fine 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.290
 is a small camera that is somehow 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.400
 something like a whirl 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.300
 I have to look lima that's the role 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.680
 camp very small is somehow whole 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.700
 Funny because I wear it in the neck 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.980
 Can I can with the clip 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.540
 can at some point at the reverse moor the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.360
 remote control with my smartphone and 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.100
 Also there are cases with which I 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.730
 then this camera as an action camera 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.269
 can use 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.430
 very interesting cost 149 euro is one 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.630
 great extension to funny shots 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.800
 I can do it as well then 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.550
 You can even use a mini 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.780
 display on it so a lcd display so 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.660
 to be able to read certain functions 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.739
 quite marty 149 euro and I have one 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.290
 small camera for all eventualities 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.820
 fits in the pants pocket bothers me 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.049
 price a little 140 euros for it 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.430
 Of course, I also get others 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.359
 action camps or 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.620
 I can with my smartphone 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.909
 certainly partly better pictures 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.959
 but if i use the smartphone 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.160
 would not want to get out, that would be 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.750
 maybe an alternative 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.180
 Overall, I can say that scooter 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.740
 Here is a very interesting gadget series 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.380
 It has certainly brought with it many 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.180
 Good for other purposes I am pleased otherwise 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.960
 me on it by the foto children 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.009
 maybe a few others 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.039
 to be able to see premieres 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.580
 that was just the preview for the 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.930
 photokina 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.020
