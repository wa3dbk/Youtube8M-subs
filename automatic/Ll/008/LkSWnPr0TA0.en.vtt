00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.620
 another video and that and I will 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 now all 69 ender games kit 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.759
 Imagine and started right away 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.759
 on with the first git 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.620
 The pillow called teleporter is going down 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.680
 So each port after sustaining 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.950
 teleported is completely cured and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.160
 He is also for ten seconds 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.960
 invulnerable 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.489
 so I have to stop an immense 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.590
 advantage if I say I posted times 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.870
 will and somehow in one 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.430
 tackle device and yes there you have 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.379
 the possibility also, so to speak 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 to defend directly because you just stop 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.850
 an immense advantage over one 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 opponent has yes and then we come 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.170
 already to the next kit and pay would be 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.840
 the next child with the name duck 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.030
 guess yes with the enterhaken can 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.579
 I quickly get to others 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.110
 Attract against and move quickly 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.010
 so to speak you can enterh this 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.809
 is just a angel 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.210
 You can throw them somewhere and then 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.950
 you get that kind of spawn I just say 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 So you can of course here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 again always in the background 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.410
 yes and that is definitely good if 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.090
 I'll say chases on chases 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.590
 is because you can for example on 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.350
 pull up trees and yes yes the lesegut 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.539
 would be the golem and then with the golem 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 Iron golem kit has the advantage 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.429
 that you have other players or animals with you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.860
 right-click with right-click can pack 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.050
 and then with left again 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.899
 then throw can also stand 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.429
 he stops with a white helmet and man 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.050
 you have to imagine the whole thing like that 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.000
 right-click on a player 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.100
 and then you have this one there 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.229
 So to speak, so his luggage on the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.959
 you can just head over it 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 see on the fly and yes what, of course 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.319
 was a bit strange for 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.170
 example my round was as me 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.270
 I could die Yes I say 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.509
 still players still on mine 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.009
 Let the corpse slide, so to speak, and yes 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.660
 that was definitely fun but will 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.280
 probably also soon gefixed 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.160
 his 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.979
 The fourth child is a police officer and the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.170
 Policeman started with a punch 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.080
 with the receipt throw the opponent back 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.300
 can and will also from his 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.190
 watchdog accompanied I could now 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.720
 somehow not determine if the awake 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.640
 and something does or does not help 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
 he somehow made nothing to me 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.790
 Anyway, you can stop with this 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.330
 stick that's just a normal 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.800
 stock he still has Beck 3 and this 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.640
 State can then just stop opponents 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.870
 cautious 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 That can be pretty much in any case 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.850
 be practical in the fight when you go to 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.380
 example just wants to run away and 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.170
 then just say this with berg 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.730
 beats down and yes that is up 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.489
 every case practical and a lot 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.590
 funny kit then we come already 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.290
 to the spider that would be as fifth 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.800
 kit and the spider starts namely with 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.690
 Weave 32 weave and she can tell 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.280
 I throw through the area and the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.560
 then be just as normal 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.970
 headless so spider web blocks 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.319
 placed in which one then stops 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.260
 can hang 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.140
 she also starts with speed 1 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.480
 So that has consistently this effect 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.760
 and she can climb walls so 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.290
 This walls can possibly climb up 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.450
 Become a problem if I'm honest 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.980
 because there are also hacks with which one 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.739
 that I can say manipulate that 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.510
 you can also climb walls but yes 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.549
 On the whole, this is definitely one 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.560
 pretty blatant skip as I think so 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.860
 You can just hold you in certain 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.750
 situation, yes, I'll say away 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.370
 For example, if you can in Bielefeld 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.989
 you just climb up again and that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.480
 is in any case because pretty blatant 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.920
 advantage and therefore in any case 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.660
 pretty strong kit 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.690
 so now we are already coming to 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.880
 last kit and loud the kit cactus 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.130
 and the cactus has just the possibility 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.620
 to act as a cactus when he shift 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.140
 So click shift and hold 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.030
 besides , he was standing with a green one 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.850
 a green leather helmet and with one 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.830
 green leather pants and yes with one 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.260
 certain probability gets the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.019
 attacker of the cactus I say 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.110
 also takes a fraction of his 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.819
 hurt back and that on everyone 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.100
 also fun and can be in 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.870
 certain situations I say if 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.410
 when in I'd say two hearts 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.600
 to have 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.240
 and the other player thinks guy with those 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.860
 Cactus kit attacks can of course 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.960
 also cause that he himself 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.260
 kills and yes that is in any case 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.050
 pretty funny so that was now too 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.820
 all new ender games kids in overview 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.530
 I hope the idea has you 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.120
 Of course I think so 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.630
 at this point in the comments 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.520
 what your favorite kit is so it would be 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.139
 I'm really interested and there I would 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.700
 if you like this idea 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.710
 I would have liked how I liked it 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.180
 always happy about a thumbs up 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.160
 and then I would say pure today 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.789
 people and today at 16 o'clock comes one 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.789
 battle sequence
