00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that's not been out it's because i've

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.020

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
opposed to a quick tip because there's a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
opposed to a quick tip because there's a
lot<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> could<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.729> into<00:01:32.880> detail<00:01:33.299> on

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
lot more that I could go into detail on

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.350 
lot more that I could go into detail on
it<00:01:33.689> could<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.740> better<00:01:34.950> video<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.970> yeah

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it could just be a better video so yeah

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.069 
it could just be a better video so yeah
expect<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:38.000> relatively<00:01:39.000> soon<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> want
