let's<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.080> back<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.380> vm<00:00:25.590> 63<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.699> fairly

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
let's get back to vm 63 it is fairly

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.750 
let's get back to vm 63 it is fairly
expensive<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.050> my<00:00:28.170> opinion<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.609> get

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
expensive in my opinion so you can get

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.560 
expensive in my opinion so you can get
it<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.410> 1,300<00:00:31.410> p<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.949> day<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.540> three

thousand rupee for one month which is a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
thousand rupee for one month which is a
the<00:00:38.790> cost<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.829> novels<00:00:40.829> fo<00:00:41.190> standard

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the way and your chat and so let's just

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.359 
the way and your chat and so let's just
go<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.939> spraying<00:01:14.450> well<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.229> from<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.860> gun<00:01:17.189> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
go in spraying well so from that gun I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
go in spraying well so from that gun I
would<00:01:17.640> personally<00:01:17.880> expect<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> huge<00:01:18.869> benefit

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
would personally expect a huge benefit

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.789 
would personally expect a huge benefit
obviously<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> mess<00:01:22.950> again<00:01:24.380> where<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
obviously so it is a mess again where it

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.420 
obviously so it is a mess again where it
goes<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.250> much<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.360> personally

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
goes really much and I would personally

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
goes really much and I would personally
want<00:01:29.430> something<00:01:30.030> good<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.200> at<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
want something good for that but at this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
want something good for that but at this
moment<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.610> can't<00:01:32.850> see<00:01:33.119> anything<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.900> I'm

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
moment I can't see anything it so I'm

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.080 
moment I can't see anything it so I'm
just<00:01:34.229> playing<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.680> usual<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:38.090> well

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
just playing as usual with this and well

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
just playing as usual with this and well
it<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> heavy<00:01:40.650> weight<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.189> has<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> long

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it has a heavy weight it has a long

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.310 
it has a heavy weight it has a long
reload<00:01:41.880> rate<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.710> fairly<00:01:43.710> average

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
reload rate it has a fairly average

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
reload rate it has a fairly average
amount<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.530> shots<00:01:46.890> per<00:01:47.070> clip<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.820> 100

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
amount of shots per clip so you have 100

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
amount of shots per clip so you have 100
shots<00:01:48.420> per<00:01:48.570> clip<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.020> overall<00:01:49.350> demolition<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
shots per clip and overall demolition of

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.639 
shots per clip and overall demolition of
200<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.939> that's<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.930> same<00:01:52.140> stats<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
200 so that's just the same stats as a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.420 
200 so that's just the same stats as a
regular<00:01:53.100> m60<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.799> meant<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.399> be

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
regular m60 and if this is meant to be

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
regular m60 and if this is meant to be
an<00:01:56.670> advanced<00:01:57.180> version<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> m60<00:01:58.290> like

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
an advanced version of the m60 like

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.359 
an advanced version of the m60 like
mashing<00:01:59.100> again<00:01:59.420> then<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.180> still<00:02:04.369> not

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
mashing again then this is still not

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.000 
mashing again then this is still not
anything<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.659> importance<00:02:07.170> because<00:02:08.069> well

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.770 

it<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.580> same<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:13.000> any<00:02:13.180> other<00:02:13.300> machine

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
it is just the same as any other machine

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.250 
it is just the same as any other machine
gun<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.890> far<00:02:15.220> as<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.490> see<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.870> sucks

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
gun as far as I can see so it sucks

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.370 
gun as far as I can see so it sucks
pretty<00:02:17.530> much<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:19.480> accuracy<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:20.080> first<00:02:20.320> shot

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
pretty much the accuracy of a first shot

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.060 
pretty much the accuracy of a first shot
is<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.830> good<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:23.290> has<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.710> be<00:02:23.830> said

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
is really good so that it has to be said

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.940 
is really good so that it has to be said
the<00:02:24.970> first<00:02:25.300> shot<00:02:25.840> actually<00:02:26.440> hits<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.770> target

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the first shot actually hits a target

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.220 
the first shot actually hits a target
perfectly<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:30.760> still<00:02:31.330> not<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.690> benefit

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
perfectly so that's still not a benefit

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.170 
perfectly so that's still not a benefit
because<00:02:32.260> well<00:02:33.160> within<00:02:33.430> Machine<00:02:33.700> Gun<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
because well within Machine Gun you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.560 
because well within Machine Gun you
won't<00:02:34.390> go<00:02:34.810> into<00:02:35.020> tap<00:02:35.320> firing<00:02:36.330> because<00:02:37.330> when

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
won't go into tap firing because when

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.740 
won't go into tap firing because when
you<00:02:37.720> would<00:02:37.900> need<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.170> machine<00:02:38.530> gun<00:02:38.770> after<00:02:38.890> all

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
you would need a machine gun after all

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.590 
you would need a machine gun after all
but<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:42.100> damage<00:02:42.430> isn't<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.940> great<00:02:43.180> after

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
but the damage isn't that great after

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.590 
but the damage isn't that great after
all<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.020> have<00:02:44.200> 31<00:02:44.710> damage<00:02:45.010> per<00:02:45.160> shot<00:02:45.330> which<00:02:46.330> is

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
all you have 31 damage per shot which is

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:57.200 
all you have 31 damage per shot which is
a<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:48.400> great<00:02:48.640> ever<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:51.420> rate<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.600> non<00:02:52.870> /<00:02:53.200> 15

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.530 

yeah<00:02:59.040> nothing<00:03:00.120> satisfying<00:03:01.120> about<00:03:01.270> this

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
yeah nothing satisfying about this

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.600 
yeah nothing satisfying about this
weapon<00:03:01.920> absolutely<00:03:02.920> nothing<00:03:03.310> or<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:06.370> have

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
weapon absolutely nothing or you have

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.980 
weapon absolutely nothing or you have
all<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.870> downsides<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.650> machine<00:03:08.950> gun<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
all the downsides of a machine gun and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.260 
all the downsides of a machine gun and
you<00:03:10.990> have<00:03:11.230> no<00:03:11.470> real<00:03:11.800> benefit<00:03:12.340> which<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:12.940> would

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
you have no real benefit which I would

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.940 
you have no real benefit which I would
personally<00:03:13.450> expect<00:03:14.170> regarding<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.830> high

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
personally expect regarding the high

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.100 
personally expect regarding the high
price<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:18.270> from<00:03:19.270> my<00:03:19.300> point<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.720> view<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.960> would

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
price so from my point of view I would

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.930 
price so from my point of view I would
definitely<00:03:20.440> not<00:03:20.890> recommend<00:03:21.370> buying<00:03:21.580> because

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
definitely not recommend buying because

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.810 
definitely not recommend buying because
it's<00:03:22.330> just<00:03:22.390> overpriced<00:03:23.190> maybe<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.370> good<00:03:24.550> for

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
it's just overpriced maybe it's good for

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.720 
it's just overpriced maybe it's good for
biohazard<00:03:25.480> mode<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.810> such<00:03:25.990> because<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:27.070> don't

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
biohazard mode and such because I don't

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.830 
biohazard mode and such because I don't
know<00:03:27.820> why<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.090> should<00:03:28.390> be<00:03:28.570> maybe<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.740> um<00:03:30.840> but

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
know why it should be maybe it is um but

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.090 
know why it should be maybe it is um but
I<00:03:32.670> can't<00:03:33.670> judge<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.850> at<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.240> moment<00:03:35.100> for

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
I can't judge that at the moment for

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.300 
I can't judge that at the moment for
regular<00:03:36.430> mode<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:36.820> definitely<00:03:37.240> no<00:03:37.420> go<00:03:38.310> just

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
regular mode so definitely no go just

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.110 
regular mode so definitely no go just
can't<00:03:39.880> be<00:03:40.060> used<00:03:40.330> properly<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.910> not<00:03:43.060> like

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
can't be used properly and it's not like

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.290 
can't be used properly and it's not like
I'm<00:03:43.450> doing<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.930> with<00:03:44.110> any<00:03:44.490> mesh<00:03:45.490> again<00:03:45.820> if

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
I'm doing that with any mesh again if

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.500 
I'm doing that with any mesh again if
you<00:03:46.720> give<00:03:47.500> me<00:03:47.680> an<00:03:47.860> R<00:03:48.040> PK<00:03:48.370> man<00:03:48.730> that's<00:03:49.060> much

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
you give me an R PK man that's much

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.480 
you give me an R PK man that's much
better<00:03:49.830> scoring<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:52.300> like<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:53.490> you

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
better scoring and not like this you

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.010 
better scoring and not like this you
know

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.700 

you<00:03:58.800> won't<00:03:59.040> even<00:03:59.220> hit<00:03:59.580> your<00:03:59.820> target<00:04:00.380> which<00:04:01.380> is

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
you won't even hit your target which is

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.760 
you won't even hit your target which is
just<00:04:02.100> another<00:04:02.490> regular<00:04:02.790> mg<00:04:03.480> problem<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.650> it's

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
just another regular mg problem so it's

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.770 
just another regular mg problem so it's
not<00:04:04.830> like<00:04:05.070> this<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.400> bad<00:04:05.670> mg<00:04:06.150> actually<00:04:06.780> and

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
not like this is a bad mg actually and

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.730 
not like this is a bad mg actually and
compared<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.870> other<00:04:10.050> machine<00:04:10.350> guns<00:04:10.530> it's

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
compared to other machine guns it's

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:18.550 
compared to other machine guns it's
fairly<00:04:10.950> average<00:04:11.160> but<00:04:14.330> it's<00:04:15.330> not<00:04:15.540> worth<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:16.850> so

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
fairly average but it's not worth it so

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.800 
fairly average but it's not worth it so
here<00:04:19.560> we've<00:04:19.709> got<00:04:19.739> one<00:04:20.160> good<00:04:20.310> kill<00:04:20.700> streak<00:04:21.030> but

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
here we've got one good kill streak but

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.490 
here we've got one good kill streak but
no<00:04:23.300> well<00:04:24.300> thanks<00:04:24.840> for<00:04:24.960> watching<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.470> I

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
no well thanks for watching that I

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.880 
no well thanks for watching that I
wouldn't<00:04:25.800> recommend<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:27.470> yeah<00:04:28.880> whatever
