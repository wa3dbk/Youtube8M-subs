okay so the first thing you want to do
is<00:00:02.970> for<00:00:03.210> adjusting<00:00:03.300> your<00:00:03.750> valves<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.460> get<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
is for adjusting your valves is get a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.650 
is for adjusting your valves is get a
eight<00:00:06.060> millimeter<00:00:06.569> socket<00:00:07.490> of<00:00:08.490> course<00:00:08.849> they

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
eight millimeter socket of course they

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.350 
eight millimeter socket of course they
got<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.900> spark<00:00:10.170> plug<00:00:10.349> first<00:00:11.000> and<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.179> move

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
got the spark plug first and just move

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.870 
got the spark plug first and just move
it<00:00:12.480> aside<00:00:12.889> and<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> take<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.670> all

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it aside and you want to take out all

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.150 
it aside and you want to take out all
these<00:00:15.260> bolts<00:00:16.260> holding<00:00:16.619> out<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> valve

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
these bolts holding out of the valve

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.429 
these bolts holding out of the valve
cover<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:21.720> socket<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.260> eight

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
cover and the socket is eight

00:00:22.439 --> 00:01:03.890 
cover and the socket is eight
millimeters

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:23.580 

oops

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.980 

okay<00:01:24.910> now<00:01:25.910> that<00:01:26.120> you've<00:01:26.300> removed<00:01:26.540> all<00:01:26.960> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
okay now that you've removed all the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.260 
okay now that you've removed all the
bolts<00:01:27.470> they<00:01:28.400> do<00:01:28.460> is<00:01:28.640> you're<00:01:28.820> going<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:28.970> plot

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
bolts they do is you're going to plot

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.820 
bolts they do is you're going to plot
this<00:01:29.450> breather<00:01:29.780> -<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:32.380> then<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.530> can<00:01:33.650> just

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
this breather - and then you can just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.180 
this breather - and then you can just
simply<00:01:33.980> pull<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.580> cover<00:01:34.790> right<00:01:35.120> off<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:36.190> be

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
simply pull the cover right off and be

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.220 
simply pull the cover right off and be
careful<00:01:37.520> with<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> gasket<00:01:40.840> I've<00:01:41.840> done<00:01:42.110> this

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
careful with the gasket I've done this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.470 
careful with the gasket I've done this
once<00:01:42.470> before<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.190> gaskets<00:01:43.670> probably

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
once before so this gaskets probably

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.080 
once before so this gaskets probably
have<00:01:44.570> to<00:01:44.630> replace<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.140> soon<00:01:45.640> all<00:01:46.640> right<00:01:46.730> so<00:01:47.030> you

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
have to replace it soon all right so you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.500 
have to replace it soon all right so you
set<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.450> aside<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.790> here<00:01:49.790> are<00:01:49.910> your<00:01:50.060> valves

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
set that aside and here are your valves

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.990 
set that aside and here are your valves
so<00:01:51.230> now<00:01:51.380> what<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:51.650> want<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.860> do<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.820> want

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
so now what you want to do is you want

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.540 
so now what you want to do is you want
to<00:01:53.090> rotate<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:54.229> top<00:01:54.680> dead<00:01:54.950> center<00:01:55.369> on

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
to rotate to top dead center on

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.600 
to rotate to top dead center on
compression<00:01:56.540> stroke<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.100> about<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> quarter

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
compression stroke and about a quarter

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.250 
compression stroke and about a quarter
turn<00:01:59.240> after<00:02:01.119> pull<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.240> over

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.040 

compression<00:02:06.260> there<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.369> go<00:02:07.520> now<00:02:08.479> your<00:02:08.690> valves

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
compression there you go now your valves

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.620 
compression there you go now your valves
are<00:02:09.170> loose<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:10.880> now<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.390> want<00:02:11.570> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
are loose so now that what you want to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.820 
are loose so now that what you want to
do<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.900> get<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.140> 10<00:02:13.070> millimeter<00:02:13.430> wrench<00:02:14.830> that

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
do is get a 10 millimeter wrench that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.780 
do is get a 10 millimeter wrench that
goes<00:02:16.070> on<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.400> bottom

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
goes on the bottom

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:27.160 
goes on the bottom
whoops<00:02:18.520> sorry<00:02:21.610> 14<00:02:22.610> millimeter<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:26.170> what's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
whoops sorry 14 millimeter and what's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.610 
whoops sorry 14 millimeter and what's
inside<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:32.180> want<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> put<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.870> 10

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
inside and you want to put a 10

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.460 
inside and you want to put a 10
millimeter<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.790> inside<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.230> what<00:02:36.350> you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
millimeter in the inside so what you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.190 
millimeter in the inside so what you
have<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.830> first<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.430> break<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.600> not<00:02:38.930> loose

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
have to do first is break this not loose

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.620 
have to do first is break this not loose
this<00:02:39.739> is<00:02:39.980> what<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.700> locking<00:02:40.910> nut<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
this is what is the locking nut for the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.920 
this is what is the locking nut for the
rockers<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.000> just<00:02:44.269> break<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.660> loose

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
rockers so if you just break that loose

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.030 
rockers so if you just break that loose
and<00:02:45.730> then<00:02:46.730> get<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.239> feeler<00:02:47.630> gauge<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
and then get your feeler gauge and the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.949 
and then get your feeler gauge and the
manual<00:02:49.459> calls<00:02:49.700> for<00:02:50.060> valve<00:02:50.300> clearance<00:02:50.690> for<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
manual calls for valve clearance for the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.520 
manual calls for valve clearance for the
intake<00:02:51.940> point<00:02:52.940> 10<00:02:53.299> millimeters<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.200> point

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
intake point 10 millimeters to a point

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.060 
intake point 10 millimeters to a point
15<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.299> your<00:02:56.450> feeler<00:02:56.690> gauge<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.830> have<00:02:57.950> to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
15 so on your feeler gauge you have to

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.860 
15 so on your feeler gauge you have to
find<00:03:00.370> point<00:03:01.370> 10<00:03:01.610> or<00:03:01.760> point<00:03:02.000> 15

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

so<00:03:06.870> what<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.020> used<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.500> just<00:03:07.620> do<00:03:07.770> it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
so what I used to do is just do it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.260 
so what I used to do is just do it
around<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.790> I'll<00:03:09.120> make<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.990> intake<00:03:11.540> rocker<00:03:12.540> be

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
around so I'll make the intake rocker be

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.810 
around so I'll make the intake rocker be
five<00:03:15.270> thousands<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:16.110> an<00:03:16.290> inch<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.820> stick

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
five thousands of an inch just stick

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.610 
five thousands of an inch just stick
that<00:03:17.850> underneath<00:03:18.360> there<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.410> do<00:03:19.560> is

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
that underneath there and what you do is

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500 
that underneath there and what you do is
you<00:03:19.740> loosen<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.160> knot<00:03:20.490> right<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:21.300> ten

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
you loosen this knot right here with ten

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.140 
you loosen this knot right here with ten
millimeter<00:03:21.960> and<00:03:22.340> then<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.700> gradually

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
millimeter and then you gradually

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.170 
millimeter and then you gradually
tighten<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> back<00:03:24.900> one<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.950> where<00:03:26.160> it's<00:03:26.370> just

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
tighten the back one so where it's just

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.790 
tighten the back one so where it's just
you<00:03:27.330> have<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.570> little<00:03:27.720> bit<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.930> play<00:03:28.170> up<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
you have a little bit of play up and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.910 
you have a little bit of play up and
down<00:03:28.860> play<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.370> sideways<00:03:29.820> play<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.920> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
down play in sideways play and the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.770 
down play in sideways play and the
feeler<00:03:32.190> gauge<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:33.000> nice<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.480> smooth

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
feeler gauge is in there nice and smooth

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.970 
feeler gauge is in there nice and smooth
and<00:03:34.200> not<00:03:34.950> snug<00:03:35.400> when<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.730> pull<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.060> out<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
and not snug when you pull it out and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.470 
and not snug when you pull it out and
then<00:03:37.980> after<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.970> take<00:03:39.150> your<00:03:39.330> ten

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
then after that you take your ten

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.890 
then after that you take your ten
millimeter<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.380> lock<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:41.070> down<00:03:41.900> really

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
millimeter and lock this down really

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.210 
millimeter and lock this down really
tight<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:46.350> that's<00:03:46.590> how<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:46.920> adjust<00:03:46.980> your

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
tight and that's how you adjust your

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.770 
tight and that's how you adjust your
bells

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
bells

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.760 
bells
so<00:03:48.780> once<00:03:48.960> you've<00:03:49.140> adjusted<00:03:49.440> all<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.100> them<00:03:51.770> you

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
so once you've adjusted all of them you

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.270 
so once you've adjusted all of them you
get<00:03:52.920> your<00:03:53.130> valve<00:03:53.430> cover<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:55.830> put<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.100> back

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
get your valve cover and you put it back

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.320 
get your valve cover and you put it back
you<00:03:56.460> put<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.730> breather<00:03:56.970> tube<00:03:57.240> back<00:03:57.420> in<00:03:59.330> get

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
you put the breather tube back in get

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.710 
you put the breather tube back in get
your<00:04:00.510> gasket<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.970> valve<00:04:03.240> cover<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.600> can

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
your gasket and this valve cover you can

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.450 
your gasket and this valve cover you can
just<00:04:03.900> set<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.230> gasket<00:04:04.650> right<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.040> it'll<00:04:05.310> fit

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
just set the gasket right in it'll fit

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.510 
just set the gasket right in it'll fit
perfectly<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:07.380> gently<00:04:07.770> sit<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.100> over<00:04:10.520> and

perfectly and you gently sit it over and

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.610 
perfectly and you gently sit it over and
tighten<00:04:11.850> up<00:04:11.910> all<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.209> bolts<00:04:12.510> pickup<00:04:13.290> them<00:04:13.530> in

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
tighten up all the bolts pickup them in

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:26.490 
tighten up all the bolts pickup them in

it<00:05:06.349> because<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.729> last<00:05:07.940> thing<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.210> want<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.389> do

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
it because the last thing you want to do

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.899 
it because the last thing you want to do
is<00:05:08.870> buy<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.139> new<00:05:09.379> head<00:05:09.560> and<00:05:09.830> they're<00:05:10.699> quite

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
is buy a new head and they're quite

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.990 
is buy a new head and they're quite
expensive<00:05:12.129> probably<00:05:13.129> more<00:05:13.400> than<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:13.639> engines

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
expensive probably more than the engines

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.040 
expensive probably more than the engines
you<00:05:14.330> bought<00:05:14.539> it<00:05:14.690> for<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:22.690> don't<00:05:23.690> know<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
you bought it for I don't know the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.559 
you bought it for I don't know the
torque<00:05:24.289> specifications<00:05:25.129> on<00:05:25.280> these<00:05:25.460> bolts<00:05:25.849> but

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
torque specifications on these bolts but

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.430 
torque specifications on these bolts but
a<00:05:26.599> good<00:05:26.840> rule<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.110> thumb<00:05:27.259> is<00:05:27.590> what<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:27.770> do<00:05:27.889> is<00:05:29.440> you

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
a good rule of thumb is what I do is you

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.219 
a good rule of thumb is what I do is you
put<00:05:30.650> your<00:05:30.680> nut<00:05:31.099> on<00:05:31.250> that<00:05:31.430> torch<00:05:31.780> you<00:05:32.780> put<00:05:32.990> your

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
put your nut on that torch you put your

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.890 
put your nut on that torch you put your
socket<00:05:33.979> wrench<00:05:34.130> at<00:05:34.370> 12<00:05:34.639> o'clock<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.240> you

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
socket wrench at 12 o'clock and you

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.570 
socket wrench at 12 o'clock and you
rotate<00:05:37.060> once<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.300> 6:00<00:05:38.599> and<00:05:39.560> then<00:05:39.680> again<00:05:40.039> to

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
rotate once to 6:00 and then again to

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:54.719 
rotate once to 6:00 and then again to
6:00<00:05:41.080> and<00:05:42.080> good<00:05:43.150> just<00:05:44.150> do<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.419> with<00:05:44.569> although

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.490 

this<00:05:55.729> one<00:05:56.000> needs<00:05:56.240> a<00:05:56.270> little<00:05:56.300> more<00:05:59.319> and<00:06:00.319> you'll

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
this one needs a little more and you'll

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.230 
this one needs a little more and you'll
get<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.710> feel<00:06:00.979> for<00:06:01.250> them<00:06:01.370> so<00:06:01.699> don't<00:06:01.969> worry<00:06:02.060> about

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
get a feel for them so don't worry about

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240 
get a feel for them so don't worry about
the<00:06:02.449> board<00:06:02.659> just<00:06:02.900> make<00:06:03.050> sure<00:06:03.199> they're<00:06:03.349> on<00:06:03.500> nice

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
the board just make sure they're on nice

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.999 
the board just make sure they're on nice
and<00:06:04.370> snug<00:06:05.110> but<00:06:06.110> not<00:06:06.139> too<00:06:06.530> snug<00:06:06.590> because<00:06:06.949> you

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
and snug but not too snug because you

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.610 
and snug but not too snug because you
don't<00:06:07.159> want<00:06:07.280> stripout
