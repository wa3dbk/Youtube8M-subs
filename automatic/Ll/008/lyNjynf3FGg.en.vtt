00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.650
 and they should have this space 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.410
 in technopolis 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.000
 in the first instance in contact with 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.880
 cepyme 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.869
 who was interested in our project 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.260
 then I have a pleasant surprise of 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.989
 have an amazing space to see 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.120
 to the other colleagues that we belong to 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.980
 here to be part of this exhibition 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.690
 and the space industry 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.650
 national really this joy is a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.080
 pride 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.600
 in several planes a good question of 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.670
 personal fulfillment of our group of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.129
 I work to reach people that from another 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.610
 way they would not know our 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.830
 instruments and after the side 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.110
 business to have a space and that the 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.989
 ministry is interested in our 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.260
 development is a fundamental leg for 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.600
 can have an extension in the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.050
 production scale and power really 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.610
 have a larger percentage of 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.970
 prefabricated components here 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.510
 and have a substitution model of 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.450
 imports 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.450
 with impacts in the product with 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.190
 The production process starts from 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.050
 the inputs of mining the factory 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.510
 mechanize a certain amount of 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.930
 processes and then come together in the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.350
 final assembly at the beginning we were 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.690
 two people and then thank you we would be the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.870
 growth of participation in the 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 market they were adding people and there 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.280
 we started distributing what is 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.680
 production area shopping area 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.770
 sales 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.830
 and although it is sectorized here all 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.150
 they do a little bit of everything by being an SME 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.620
 let's say that each one although it has a 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.360
 special role does different tasks all 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.820
 we make the cutting processes here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.920
 after outsourcing let's say the part of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.430
 painting in workshops that are dedicated only 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.620
 to painted the imported component on 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.150
 80 percent round manufactured 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.510
 nationally and 20 percent 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.910
 imported the idea is to replace the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.760
 one hundred percent and perform everything let's say 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170
 with national products for 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.690
 differentiate the acoustic battery from 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.600
 electronics basically electronics 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.060
 gives you greater versatility in terms of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.330
 the sounds benefits occupy less 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.280
 Space can be used with headphones and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.700
 also amplify it what it allows you 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.870
 an equal use of live sound 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.340
 exactly use of batteries 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.269
 acoustic as well as home use 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.950
 play amplified with other instruments 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.110
 and so also in recording studio 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.760
 that allows you to have a sound of a 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.760
 good quality at low cost 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.150
 de vedran was born in the year 98 I played 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.930
 the battery was studying electronics and a 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.450
 way to unite those two passions were 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.640
 arm myself an electronic battery and seeing 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.750
 a niche market that was not 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.340
 exploited I decided the marketing and 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.670
 then there we met in the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.520
 University of Buenos Aires with a canon 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.530
 we decided to grow let's say the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.319
 entrepreneurship at that time was 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.450
 coming back from an exchange state that 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.550
 I had done in Czech Republic 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.790
 I had my training content 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.180
 engineering this for a year now and the best 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.190
 not when you come back we associate for 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 give it forward entrepreneurship 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.650
 although the work of the entrepreneur is 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.190
 very sacrificed many times one gets 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.680
 can you ask me if I continue with this that I 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.480
 motivates to follow and the truth that if 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.490
 I would have to choose again what 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.350
 I wanted back because 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.100
 although it is the job that gives us 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.520
 Eating is a passion and I love the 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.520
 work
