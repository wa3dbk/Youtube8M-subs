went<00:01:52.740> with<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> fractal<00:01:53.700> design<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:54.150> for<00:01:54.390> case

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
went with a fractal design are for case

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.590 
went with a fractal design are for case
when<00:01:55.770> they're<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.340> latest<00:01:56.610> i7<00:01:57.120> not<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
when they're not the latest i7 not that

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
when they're not the latest i7 not that
was<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.080> before<00:01:58.110> Haswell<00:01:58.710> came<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
was right before Haswell came out and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.950 
was right before Haswell came out and
then<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.180> got<00:02:00.510> eight<00:02:01.110> gigs<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.410> ram<00:02:01.620> SSD<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
then I got eight gigs of ram SSD and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.980 
then I got eight gigs of ram SSD and
7950<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.440> decent<00:02:05.369> pfft<00:02:05.910> where<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> sounds<00:02:06.869> like

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
7950 so decent pfft where it sounds like

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
7950 so decent pfft where it sounds like
