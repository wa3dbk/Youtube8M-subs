00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
mad he got when EA sold the exclusivity

mad he got when EA sold the exclusivity
to<00:01:21.920> Microsoft<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.490> kind<00:01:23.819> of<00:01:23.939> tells<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:24.749 
to Microsoft it kind of tells you that

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:25.910 
to Microsoft it kind of tells you that
there's<00:01:25.049> no<00:01:25.200> way<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:25.770> happen

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
there's no way it's going to happen

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.029 
there's no way it's going to happen
again<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:27.149> amount<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.719> money<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.200> respawn

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
again the amount of money that respawn

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.149 
again the amount of money that respawn
and<00:01:29.369> EA<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:30.119> make<00:01:30.359> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> exact

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and EA could make I don't know the exact

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.599 
and EA could make I don't know the exact
number<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> ps3<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.869> ps4<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.740> together<00:01:35.130> sold

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
number of ps3 and ps4 is together sold

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.209 
number of ps3 and ps4 is together sold
but<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.450> well<00:01:36.659> over<00:01:37.079> 80<00:01:37.289> million<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.950> sure

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
but it's well over 80 million I'm sure

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.389 
but it's well over 80 million I'm sure
so<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.029> half<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:39.600> people<00:01:39.829> bought<00:01:40.829> titanfall

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
so if half those people bought titanfall

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.499 
so if half those people bought titanfall
that's<00:01:42.359> a<00:01:42.659> 40<00:01:43.139> million<00:01:43.380> copies<00:01:43.859> sold<00:01:44.209> so<00:01:45.209> it's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
that's a 40 million copies sold so it's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
that's a 40 million copies sold so it's
a<00:01:45.659> huge<00:01:45.689> moneymaker<00:01:46.349> it's<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.979> huge<00:01:47.249> moneymaker

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a huge moneymaker it's a huge moneymaker

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.120 
a huge moneymaker it's a huge moneymaker
and<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.599> don't<00:01:48.840> think<00:01:48.990> there's<00:01:49.229> any<00:01:49.499> amount<00:01:49.979> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and I don't think there's any amount of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940 
and I don't think there's any amount of
money<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.700> Microsoft<00:01:51.630> could<00:01:51.990> offer<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:52.679> don't

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
money that Microsoft could offer I don't

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.519

reality but like I said I really really

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.229 
reality but like I said I really really

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
to I also think that titanfall like I've

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.120 
to I also think that titanfall like I've
said<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.390> past<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.959> probably<00:03:13.470> held<00:03:13.830> back<00:03:14.100> a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
said in the past is probably held back a

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.759 
said in the past is probably held back a
bit<00:03:14.489> by<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.540> fact<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.110> releasing<00:03:16.500> on

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
bit by the fact that it's releasing on

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.039 
bit by the fact that it's releasing on
last<00:03:17.069> gen<00:03:17.400> 2<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.299> I<00:03:18.450> think<00:03:18.690> there's<00:03:18.870> some

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
last gen 2 and I think there's some

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.660 
last gen 2 and I think there's some
games<00:03:19.290> coming<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.980> aren't<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.579> be

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
games coming that aren't going to be

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.910 
games coming that aren't going to be
held<00:03:20.880> back<00:03:21.060> by<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.810> are<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.650> going<00:03:22.829> to

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
held back by that and are just going to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.190 
held back by that and are just going to
blow<00:03:23.160> our<00:03:23.430> minds<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.060> think<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> future<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
video to talk about it because i see a

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.160 
video to talk about it because i see a
lot<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> comments<00:04:05.730> saying<00:04:06.359> that<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.989> know

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
there's just no way that it would be

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
Microsoft could ever offer them going to
