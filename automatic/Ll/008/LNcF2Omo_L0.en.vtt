 acquired a reasonable position 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:12.060
 take in as knowledge of

 everything related to it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.110
 we have therefore deployed a meter deep 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.539
 which provides for an intensive outpatient 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
 ban that means staying home leave 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.140
 but you will receive treatment with 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.310
 same balloon intensity 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.630
 as a clinical treatment one 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.409
 treatment that does require a bed 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.960
 gets 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.640
 okay and that is very distinctive 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.069
 very important people like it

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.729
 relationship has a lot about it soon 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.929
 damage sustained your addiction 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.569
 you don't need it again 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.940

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.190
 does that yes not where you can sleep 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.690
 you can compile a high heath 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.789

 you can practice outside 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.690
 well that translates in my eyes 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.670
 success rates that makes it up to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.070

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.880
 to be 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.079
 I know what it's like to be extremely lonely 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.940
