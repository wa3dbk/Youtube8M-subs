00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.850
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.190
 alexander pro vector and 12 issue 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.710
 opens half-life 2 episode 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.809
 official forts so far and final 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.450
 part of a series about the adventures of gordon 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.790
 Freeman does not make sense to retell the plot 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.360
 for the game is not new for a long time and many have passed 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.850
 its nafig and say one halfa 2 is a shooter 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 first person old school with excellent 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.830
 storyline and advanced gameplay where 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.379
 will have to not only shoot but also think 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.500
 the game is exclusive for devices 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.050
 on tiger processors yes yes again n video 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.449
 I threw another mega game to my favorites 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.210
 But there is one thing but in the market the game 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.729
 only supported on tiger xuan a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.400
 This means that the game 4 and kay one 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.340
 thrown either the game is temporary 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 exclusive for the sheltie console but 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.369
 as a fact 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.920
 on your screens the gameplay from the tablet and 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.740
 nvidia shield tablet on kay one tiger and 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.080
 apparently the game works fine, but 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.400
 tegra 4 is already noticeable significant 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.189
 drawdown fps 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.789
 It should be said about the weight of the game more than four 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.490
 gigabyte 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.680
 are almost a record well and how 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.439
 always the game is devoid of touch control 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.140
 so the gamepad is strictly required 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.149
 finally added the Russian language however 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.579
 the voice of the original English 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.200
 Well, let's wait for the official 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.780
 google play support for 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.909
 tegra 4i kay one processors 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.929
 Do you understand it does not look beautiful and 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.929
 even suspicious 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.400
 and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.640
 the second game for the target of man from 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.690
 developers popular strategies 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.110
 anomaly 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.980
 and is survival in 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.750
 postapocalyptic world where you 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.420
 will have to explore the territory 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.520
 constantly be in search of food and others 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.190
 which will help to survive 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.870
 also the game is not devoid of crafting along 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.210
 passing you need to follow as for 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.340
 the state of their heroes so for their 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.340
 everyone's mood is unique 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.140
 skills and only together can survive but not 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.240
 there were no other survivors 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.820
 that they may encounter 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.500
 to be both friendly and hostile 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.780
 so you have to take 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.060
 sometimes even hard decisions that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.520
 can be both true and wrong 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.400
 which can greatly affect the passage 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.080
 how good and bad 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.150
 there is a change of day and night stylish 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.150
 graphics and of course pleases the presence 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.980
 Russian whole game can be called 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.310
 masterpiece and generally unique in its 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.310
 genre 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.950
 the next game Mishin impossible horns and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.950
 nations by glue 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.590
 as always the next kir moan of donat 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.959
 and the energy of the mission is short but on 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.240
 surprise varied also besides 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.640
 missions will have to defend their headquarters and 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.920
 other significant places from other players 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.650
 perhaps the only thing that even surprised 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.660
 This is a pvp mode with an attack on others 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.920
 players and accordingly theft 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.650
 any resources 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.050
 filed structure turned out almost 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.030
 not perfect milking machine which on 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.060
 every step will be required from the player 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.489
 spend gaming currency schedule base not 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.660
 stepped forward but generally looks and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.660
 played pretty well 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.800
 warner's fourth mesh in berlin game 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.289
 brothers 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.169
 the game is nothing but advertising 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.509
 upcoming movie agents an n k l 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:56.050
 choose one of the two main characters 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:58.840
 agent KGB or agent CIA and forward 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.180
 Berlin is a fairly extensive city in the game 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.340
 there is the possibility of car theft 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.590
 mission goals will be simple somewhere 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.930
 get to find something or someone 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.819
 kill as you progress accrued 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.050
 points for which you can pump skills 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.240
 to your hero 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.520
 as for the graphics, it is quite 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.800
 tolerable but the management is not very 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.750
 comfortable worth noting and online mode 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.180
 multiplayer from which even a little 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.129
 prolongs the game life as a whole 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.129
 story campaign short 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.060
 The last game of agario popular 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.460
 browser migrated to android 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.770
 is the official port target in the game 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.930
 just to manage ugly color 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.210
 ball constantly collect others 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.220
 and of course there are other players who 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.310
 have not had time to grow to your size 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.710
 from very fat players will need 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.750
 run away and hide also not deprived 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.669
 opportunities to multiply for more 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.320
 effective capture of players by less 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.080
 but one but 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.550
 location in this version is many times less and to 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.120
 management needs to get used 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.919
 Overall, the game is fun and addictive if 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.550
 you never heard or played 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.120
 agarium 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:28.400
 I advise you to read only play 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.400
 the best and with you was alexander projector
