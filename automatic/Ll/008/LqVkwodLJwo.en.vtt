other videos thing which I'm hoping that

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.650 
other videos thing which I'm hoping that
so<00:00:14.930> you<00:00:14.990> don't<00:00:15.230> mind<00:00:15.410> some<00:00:15.650> novelty<00:00:16.240> there<00:00:17.240> are

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.030 
but let's get back to the five minute so
I<00:00:20.090> was<00:00:20.240> doing<00:00:20.450> well<00:00:20.630> yesterday<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.740> now<00:00:21.980> I'm

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
I was doing well yesterday and now I'm

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.200 
I was doing well yesterday and now I'm
gonna<00:00:22.189> get<00:00:22.369> hammered<00:00:22.520> probably<00:00:23.119> because

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
gonna get hammered probably because

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.990 
gonna get hammered probably because
let's<00:00:26.210> play<00:00:26.779> gambit<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.439> get<00:00:28.220> this<00:00:28.340> w<00:00:28.489> am<00:00:28.820> out

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
let's play gambit to get this w am out

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.600 
let's play gambit to get this w am out
of<00:00:29.029> book<00:00:32.110> which<00:00:33.110> she<00:00:34.010> doesn't<00:00:34.310> seem<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:34.489> want

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
of book which she doesn't seem to want

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.349 
of book which she doesn't seem to want
to<00:00:34.880> go<00:00:34.940> out<00:00:35.090> book<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.200> think<00:00:37.329> already<00:00:38.329> a

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
to go out book so I think already a

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.110 
to go out book so I think already a
minor<00:00:38.870> success<00:00:39.609> because<00:00:40.609> I<00:00:40.670> think<00:00:40.879> whites

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
minor success because I think whites

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.639 
minor success because I think whites
position<00:00:41.570> is<00:00:41.690> ok<00:00:42.079> here<00:00:43.929> so<00:00:44.929> yeah<00:00:45.079> yesterday<00:00:45.440> I

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
position is ok here so yeah yesterday I

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.860 
position is ok here so yeah yesterday I
had<00:00:45.769> a<00:00:46.010> winning<00:00:46.280> streak<00:00:46.609> are<00:00:46.850> 16<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.420> lost<00:00:47.660> one

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
had a winning streak are 16 and lost one

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.740 
had a winning streak are 16 and lost one
so<00:00:48.140> that<00:00:48.949> means<00:00:49.250> that<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.760> auto<00:00:49.940> pairing<00:00:50.480> is

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
so that means that the auto pairing is

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.900 
so that means that the auto pairing is
going<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.260> be<00:00:51.350> much<00:00:51.530> tougher<00:00:52.539> today<00:00:54.910> special

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to be much tougher today special

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.759 
going to be much tougher today special
be<00:00:56.059> 50<00:00:56.690> Bishop<00:00:57.589> c4<00:00:59.199> and<00:01:02.140> I'm<00:01:03.140> hoping<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:03.620> I

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
be 50 Bishop c4 and I'm hoping that I

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.570 
be 50 Bishop c4 and I'm hoping that I
can<00:01:04.480> scrape<00:01:05.480> together<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:06.370> least<00:01:07.370> some<00:01:07.550> good

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
can scrape together I least some good

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.930 
can scrape together I least some good
pie<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.740> possible<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:12.530> let's<00:01:12.710> see<00:01:12.980> night<00:01:13.400> g5

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
pie a possible so let's see night g5

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.730 
pie a possible so let's see night g5
hair<00:01:15.160> cleansing<00:01:16.160> f4<00:01:17.140> maybe<00:01:18.140> I'm<00:01:18.260> potentially

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
hair cleansing f4 maybe I'm potentially

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.340

free taking d5 okay now my knight can
swim<00:01:25.970> back<00:01:26.180> makes<00:01:26.600> these<00:01:26.900> shakes<00:01:29.440> I'm<00:01:30.440> not

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
swim back makes these shakes I'm not

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.470 
swim back makes these shakes I'm not
sure<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:30.980> that<00:01:31.040> bad<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.730> moment<00:01:32.330> bar

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
sure it's that bad and moment bar

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.240 
sure it's that bad and moment bar
suppose<00:01:32.840> f<00:01:33.050> 6<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:34.490> going<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.670> be<00:01:34.760> dangerous

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
suppose f 6 it's going to be dangerous

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.280 
suppose f 6 it's going to be dangerous

squares just yet okay now I'll go in for

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.360 
squares just yet okay now I'll go in for
this<00:02:07.100> some<00:02:07.420> continuation<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:11.440> is<00:02:12.440> e<00:02:12.739> takes<00:02:13.010> f6

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
this some continuation to is e takes f6

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.610 
this some continuation to is e takes f6
possible<00:02:13.820> 95<00:02:14.360> things

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
possible 95 things

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.569 
possible 95 things
and<00:02:17.360> mine<00:02:18.360> takes<00:02:18.599> f6<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.129> win<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> dark

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
squared bishop may be Queen takes d5

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.479 
squared bishop may be Queen takes d5
after<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.989> will<00:02:25.049> seem<00:02:25.290> too<00:02:25.470> bad<00:02:26.689> okay

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
after that it will seem too bad okay

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.970 
after that it will seem too bad okay
might<00:02:29.489> be<00:02:29.670> five<00:02:29.909> now<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:31.590> trying<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.890> get

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
might be five now just trying to get

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.490 
might be five now just trying to get
this<00:02:32.629> what's<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.780> doing<00:02:33.989> there<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:34.319> these

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
sakes yeah I think I'm 26 might take see

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.429 
sakes yeah I think I'm 26 might take see
a<00:02:38.730> map<00:02:39.120> maybe<00:02:39.359> maybe<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.230> otherwise

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
a map maybe maybe because otherwise

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:48.229 
a map maybe maybe because otherwise
what's<00:02:40.709> like<00:02:40.980> doing<00:02:41.280> any<00:02:41.430> way<00:02:41.959> over<00:02:42.959> there<00:02:47.239> so
