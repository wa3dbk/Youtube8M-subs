believe<00:00:17.670> also<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.570> weather<00:00:18.990> resistant<00:00:19.529> version

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
believe also a weather resistant version

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
on my website where I compared this to a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
on my website where I compared this to a
31<00:01:17.400> military<00:01:17.939> F<00:01:18.150> 1.8<00:01:19.070> I'm<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.220> sure<00:01:20.580> post<00:01:21.210> a

link to that also have a review for this

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.520 
link to that also have a review for this
lens<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.280> by<00:01:26.640> itself<00:01:27.020> which<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
lens just by itself which is what this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.120 
lens just by itself which is what this
video<00:01:28.710> was<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:30.530> I'll<00:01:31.530> show<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.860> what<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
video was for I'll show you what it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.249 
video was for I'll show you what it
looks<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.869> Pentax<00:01:33.869> k7<00:01:34.770> camera<00:01:35.340> wedeck

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
looks like on a Pentax k7 camera wedeck

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:43.850 
looks like on a Pentax k7 camera wedeck
besides<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.409> reference<00:01:42.500> k7<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> little

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
besides your reference k7 is a little

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.920 
besides your reference k7 is a little
bigger<00:01:44.040> than<00:01:45.380> most<00:01:46.380> entry-level<00:01:47.570> DSLRs<00:01:48.570> but

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
bigger than most entry-level DSLRs but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.039 
bigger than most entry-level DSLRs but
so<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.890> small<00:01:50.240> fits<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> nicely<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.930> this

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
so pretty small fits a nicely with this

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:11.119 
so pretty small fits a nicely with this
cam<00:01:53.869> try<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> focus<00:01:55.470> sound

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.680 

and<00:02:12.129> it's<00:02:12.340> got<00:02:12.519> these<00:02:12.760> as<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.269> screw

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
and it's got these as the screw

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.350 
and it's got these as the screw
mechanism<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.980> autofocus<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:15.940> will<00:02:16.209> have

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
mechanism for autofocus so you will have

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.530 
mechanism for autofocus so you will have
some<00:02:16.629> sound<00:02:16.959> with<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:18.090> whether<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.299> very

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
some sound with that whether it's very

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.630 
some sound with that whether it's very
reliable<00:02:20.230> pretty<00:02:21.010> fast<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:24.340> was<00:02:24.489> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
reliable pretty fast so that was the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.020 
reliable pretty fast so that was the
Pentax<00:02:25.030> 18<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.750> 55<00:02:26.170> millimeter<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.940> 3.5<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.269> 5.6

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
Pentax 18 to 55 millimeter at 3.5 to 5.6

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.420 
Pentax 18 to 55 millimeter at 3.5 to 5.6
for<00:02:31.030> Pentax
