 video is turning for your audience and 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.149

 Youtube video a lot of fun 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.559
 for the dough d red devils we need 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.510
 more margarine than market a few 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.730
 Chopped almonds because we lack 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.050
 taste very Doll like for like, you can 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 Also, take the user's day or just 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.150
 leave out completely is just a matter of taste 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.520
 a pinch of salt also for the need 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.850
 we still have a bowl of strawberries for the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.380
 cvag we need quark 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 whipped cream yogurt and whipped cream and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.579
 cane sugar is ours, so to speak 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.890
 sweetener for all three layers 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.890
 and comes in every layer 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.130
 so these are our stripes that will be 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.290
 me together on a baking sheet 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.509
 distribute one recognized and one comes 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.190
 at 200 degrees in the oven and even if the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.820
 have such a few thicker pieces have 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.039
 no fear 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 after she got really pretty 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.280
 However, the oven could do a bit 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.590
 flying apart a bit finer 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.930
 poetry and so to speak so come now 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.090
 so streusel at 200 degrees 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.730
 for a few minutes until she is beautiful 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.770
 crispy baked in the oven I 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.770
 would say 10 to 15 minutes are enough 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.090
 the edmonton is freed from the green and 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.950
 washed and then we have one more 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.870
 a few split up later 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.250
 decoration to use now gives me 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.190
 a bit down it was about my aunt 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.320

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.610
 It's going to be like doing the videos 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.020
 We get the ground first and then 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.000
 is there, of course, we find the proud 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.530
 so that you have the solid ground and 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 I just fill it on the floor 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.690
 if the road would give the cream 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.890
 now we do and strawberry needs it 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.580
 long as the whole front sprinkles 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.470
 Cream must be so we are now in 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.090
 layers that's how it looks from above 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.550

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.260
