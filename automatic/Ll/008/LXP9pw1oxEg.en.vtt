00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.439 

in<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.079> video<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.469> want<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.890> talk<00:00:01.979> about

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:02.449 
in this video I want to talk about

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:04.670 
in this video I want to talk about
embedding<00:00:03.449> content<00:00:04.080> from<00:00:04.230> other<00:00:04.380> sources

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
embedding content from other sources

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.220 
embedding content from other sources
whether<00:00:05.190> it's<00:00:05.460> your<00:00:05.730> own<00:00:05.850> content<00:00:06.359> or<00:00:06.600> another

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
whether it's your own content or another

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.530 
whether it's your own content or another
person's<00:00:07.649> from<00:00:07.980> other<00:00:08.130> websites<00:00:08.540> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
person's from other websites and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.780 
person's from other websites and
embedding<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.200> into<00:00:10.590> Edmodo<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.490> why<00:00:11.730> you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
embedding that into Edmodo and why you

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.660 
embedding that into Edmodo and why you
do<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> how<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.799> what

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
do that and how you go about it and what

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.310 
do that and how you go about it and what
the<00:00:14.700> benefit<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.529> guess<00:00:16.949> when<00:00:17.190> you

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
the benefit is and I guess when you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
the benefit is and I guess when you
present<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.650> content<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.279> your<00:00:20.430> students

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
present in content for your students

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.599 
present in content for your students
online<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:22.050> an<00:00:22.410> environment<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.130> Edmodo

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
online in an environment like Edmodo

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.670 
online in an environment like Edmodo
there<00:00:24.449> are<00:00:24.570> two<00:00:24.720> main<00:00:24.869> ways<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
there are two main ways you can do it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.900 
there are two main ways you can do it
you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:27.019> link<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.260> link<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> website<00:00:29.580> or

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you can link or link to a website or

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.510 
you can link or link to a website or
upload<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.810> file<00:00:31.019> itself<00:00:31.199> which<00:00:31.980> enables<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
upload the file itself which enables the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.660 
upload the file itself which enables the
student<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> click<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.420> fire<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> link<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.670> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
student to click and fire the link or to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
student to click and fire the link or to
download<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.480> file<00:00:36.660> itself<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.100> can

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
download the file itself or you can

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.209 
download the file itself or you can
embed<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.480> basically<00:00:40.350> puts<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.860> exact

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
embed it which basically puts that exact

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.299 
embed it which basically puts that exact
same<00:00:41.399> content<00:00:41.910> directly<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.320> website

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
same content directly into your website

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.150 
same content directly into your website
so<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.170> students<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.469> able<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
so that students are actually able to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.270 
so that students are actually able to
interact<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.270> view<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:48.870> read<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
interact with in view or read the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.029 
interact with in view or read the
content<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.510> want<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.780> include<00:00:52.039> right

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
content that you want to include right

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
content that you want to include right
there<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.520> Edmodo<00:00:53.879> rather<00:00:54.570> than<00:00:54.780> having<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
there in Edmodo rather than having to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.939 
there in Edmodo rather than having to
you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:55.949> follow<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> link<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.510> to

all<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:02.550> place<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.379> learning

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
all there in one place as learning

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.740 
all there in one place as learning
activity<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.760> useful<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.210> embed<00:01:06.540> as

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
activity it's really useful to embed as

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.050 
activity it's really useful to embed as
well<00:01:06.990> because<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
well because I can actually have the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
well because I can actually have the
instructions<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.810> questions<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.590> focus<00:01:11.250> task

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
instructions or questions or focus task

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.810 
instructions or questions or focus task
in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.479> message<00:01:12.900> body<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
video or whatever the resource is

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
video or whatever the resource is
directly<00:01:17.700> below<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.439> everything's<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
directly below it and everything's in

directly below it and everything's in
one<00:01:19.770> place<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.330> easier<00:01:21.360> for

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
one place and it's a lot easier for

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.580 
one place and it's a lot easier for
students<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.560> follow<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> there's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
students to actually follow so there's

students to actually follow so there's
the<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:25.860> examples<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> same

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the two examples there that's the same

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.910 
the two examples there that's the same
video<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.549> follow<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> link

it
you<00:01:43.390> know<00:01:43.479> directly<00:01:43.869> within<00:01:44.109> edmodo<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.909> the

you know directly within edmodo it's the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.200 
you know directly within edmodo it's the
same<00:01:46.210> thing<00:01:46.240> with<00:01:46.569> documents<00:01:47.969> here<00:01:48.969> I've<00:01:49.179> got

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
same thing with documents here I've got

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.020 
same thing with documents here I've got
two<00:01:49.840> examples<00:01:50.319> of<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.530> same<00:01:50.710> document<00:01:51.219> here

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
two examples of the same document here

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.599 
two examples of the same document here
I've<00:01:52.380> simply<00:01:53.380> uploaded<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.069> document<00:01:54.490> to

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
I've simply uploaded the document to

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.630 
I've simply uploaded the document to
Edmodo<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:56.170> if<00:01:56.530> students<00:01:57.130> click<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.490> that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
Edmodo and if students click on that

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.279 
Edmodo and if students click on that
they<00:01:57.880> download<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.569> to<00:01:58.689> their<00:01:58.869> computer

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
they download it to their computer

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.639 
they download it to their computer
before<00:01:59.649> they<00:01:59.979> can<00:02:00.159> do<00:02:00.280> anything<00:02:00.310> with<00:02:00.789> it

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
before they can do anything with it

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.880 
before they can do anything with it
whereas<00:02:02.649> here<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:04.479> example<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:05.170> actually

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
whereas here in this example I actually

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.279 
whereas here in this example I actually
have<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.939> document<00:02:07.420> uploaded<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.019> another

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
have the document uploaded to another

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.080 
have the document uploaded to another
site<00:02:08.560> called<00:02:09.190> scribd<00:02:10.110> where<00:02:11.110> I<00:02:11.500> then<00:02:12.489> have

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
site called scribd where I then have

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.699 
site called scribd where I then have
embedded<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.170> students<00:02:14.530> can

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
embedded it so that students can

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.339 
embedded it so that students can
actually<00:02:14.890> read<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.519> view<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:17.079> that's<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
actually read and view it so that's the

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.710 
actually read and view it so that's the
principle<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.950> embedding<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.360> little<00:02:19.599> bit

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
principle of embedding it's a little bit

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.430 
principle of embedding it's a little bit
easier<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:20.230> Edmodo<00:02:21.129> because<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:22.239> lot<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:22.989> what

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
easier with Edmodo because a lot of what

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.770 
easier with Edmodo because a lot of what
you<00:02:23.590> actually<00:02:23.769> upload<00:02:24.489> gets<00:02:25.090> automatically

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you actually upload gets automatically

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.619 
you actually upload gets automatically
embedded<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.250> what<00:02:27.910> you'll<00:02:28.060> find<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.599> that

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
embedded so what you'll find is that

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.449 
embedded so what you'll find is that
this<00:02:28.900> file<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.560> any<00:02:29.799> file<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
this file that you any file that you

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.850 
this file that you any file that you
upload<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:31.090> Edmodo<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.319> Microsoft

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
upload to Edmodo if it's a Microsoft

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.990 
upload to Edmodo if it's a Microsoft
file<00:02:33.599> or<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.660> PDF<00:02:34.959> or<00:02:35.819> anything<00:02:36.819> like<00:02:36.849> that

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
file or a PDF or anything like that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.500 
file or a PDF or anything like that
powerpoints<00:02:38.730> Edmodo<00:02:39.730> will<00:02:39.970> automatically

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
powerpoints Edmodo will automatically

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.809 
powerpoints Edmodo will automatically
embed<00:02:40.660> them<00:02:41.049> even<00:02:41.680> though<00:02:41.859> you're<00:02:42.129> simply

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
embed them even though you're simply

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.539 
embed them even though you're simply
uploading<00:02:43.239> them<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.500> YouTube<00:02:44.829> videos<00:02:45.250> as

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
uploading them the YouTube videos as

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.080 
uploading them the YouTube videos as
well<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.109> quite<00:02:47.319> useful<00:02:47.470> because<00:02:48.000> even<00:02:49.000> if

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
well can be quite useful because even if

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.729 
well can be quite useful because even if
you<00:02:49.120> just<00:02:49.420> put<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> link<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.530> will

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
you just put in the link it will

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.390 
you just put in the link it will
actually<00:02:50.889> a<00:02:51.430> lot<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.150> cases<00:02:52.359> will<00:02:52.660> auto-embed

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
actually a lot of cases will auto-embed

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.680 
actually a lot of cases will auto-embed
but<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.549> are<00:02:54.579> some<00:02:54.849> things<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.329> might<00:02:55.450> come

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
but there are some things you might come

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.509 
but there are some things you might come
across<00:02:55.720> from<00:02:56.260> time<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.650> time<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.099> you<00:02:57.250> find

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
across from time to time that you find

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.400 
across from time to time that you find
on<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.730> web<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.599> you'd<00:02:58.989> rather<00:02:59.169> have

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
on the web that you'd rather have

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.180 
on the web that you'd rather have
embedded<00:03:00.209> directly<00:03:01.209> into<00:03:01.450> your<00:03:01.750> post<00:03:02.139> and<00:03:03.010> you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
embedded directly into your post and you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.670 
embedded directly into your post and you
need<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.459> do<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.730> manually<00:03:04.090> yourself<00:03:04.680> some

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
need to do that manually yourself some

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.729 
need to do that manually yourself some
of<00:03:05.769> those<00:03:05.859> things<00:03:06.099> actually<00:03:06.340> could<00:03:06.760> be<00:03:07.739> it

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
of those things actually could be it

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.370 
of those things actually could be it
might<00:03:08.950> have<00:03:09.280> actually<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:10.120> survey<00:03:10.569> or<00:03:10.599> some

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
might have actually a survey or some

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.559 
might have actually a survey or some
sort<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.650> online<00:03:12.519> forum<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:13.000> want<00:03:13.180> students

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
sort of online forum you want students

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.339 
sort of online forum you want students
to<00:03:13.840> complete<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:16.030> can<00:03:16.180> actually<00:03:16.359> you

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
to complete and you can actually you

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.940 
to complete and you can actually you
know<00:03:17.500> get<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.900> embed<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:19.959> into<00:03:20.380> your<00:03:20.680> Edmodo

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
know get the embed that into your Edmodo

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.479 
know get the embed that into your Edmodo
post<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:22.510> same<00:03:22.690> with<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.560> know<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.709> powerpoint

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
post the same with you know a powerpoint

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.900 
post the same with you know a powerpoint
or<00:03:25.180> all<00:03:25.599> that<00:03:25.810> sort<00:03:26.139> of<00:03:26.200> thing<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.549> it's

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
or all that sort of thing and it's

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.870 
or all that sort of thing and it's
really<00:03:28.090> very<00:03:28.450> very<00:03:28.750> simple<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.590> do<00:03:29.739> once<00:03:30.700> you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
really very very simple to do once you

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.520 
really very very simple to do once you
know<00:03:31.000> how<00:03:31.030> there's<00:03:31.569> only<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.840> couple<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.290> steps

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
know how there's only a couple of steps

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.830 
know how there's only a couple of steps
so<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.489> actually<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.299> content<00:03:34.690> that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
so you actually go to the content that

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.280 
so you actually go to the content that
you<00:03:35.169> want<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.950> embed<00:03:36.250> let's<00:03:37.120> say<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:38.079> is<00:03:38.260> a

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
you want to embed let's say it is a

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.710 
you want to embed let's say it is a
YouTube<00:03:38.709> video

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
YouTube video

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.920 
YouTube video
and<00:03:39.840> what<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.710> actually<00:03:40.890> do<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.550> if<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.780> were

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and what you actually do is if we were

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.110 
and what you actually do is if we were
to<00:03:43.170> refresh<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:46.770> you<00:03:46.910> can<00:03:47.910> see

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to refresh that this so that you can see

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.510 
to refresh that this so that you can see
more<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.630> steps<00:03:48.960> involved<00:03:49.410> I'll<00:03:50.280> just

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
more of the steps involved I'll just

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.050 
more of the steps involved I'll just
pause<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:53.280> what<00:03:53.460> you'd<00:03:53.580> normally<00:03:53.610> do

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
pause that that's what you'd normally do

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.880 
pause that that's what you'd normally do
to<00:03:54.210> watch<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.570> video<00:03:54.780> you've<00:03:55.320> watch<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> there

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
to watch the video you've watch it there

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.000 
to watch the video you've watch it there
in<00:03:56.010> YouTube<00:03:56.990> but<00:03:57.990> most<00:03:58.230> sites<00:03:58.530> with<00:03:58.860> that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
in YouTube but most sites with that

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.190 
in YouTube but most sites with that
allow<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.640> embed<00:03:59.760> their<00:04:00.210> content<00:04:00.660> they

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
allow you to embed their content they

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.860 
allow you to embed their content they
have<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> button<00:04:01.830> or<00:04:02.040> an<00:04:02.370> option<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:03.240> share<00:04:03.540> or

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
have a button or an option to share or

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.030 
have a button or an option to share or
embed<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.060> here<00:04:06.060> with<00:04:06.960> YouTube<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.710> to

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
embed it and here with YouTube it's a to

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.430 
embed it and here with YouTube it's a to
click<00:04:08.280> process<00:04:08.520> share<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.390> then<00:04:09.420> embed<00:04:10.200> and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
click process share and then embed and

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.320 
click process share and then embed and
then<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.160> gives<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.460> this<00:04:11.610> code<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.209> it's

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
then it gives you this code that it's

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.949 
then it gives you this code that it's
highlighted<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.020> if<00:04:13.680> we<00:04:13.830> simply<00:04:14.959> right-click

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
highlighted and if we simply right-click
