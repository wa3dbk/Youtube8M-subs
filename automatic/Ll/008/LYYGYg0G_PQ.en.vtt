00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.530
 welcome to this chapter where we 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:07.390
 are going to study how to analyze the 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.390
 no limit texas hold'em poker board 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.360
 analyze the floch chart is crucial to 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.250
 more than one title 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.480
 the first reason is that there is 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.970
 now three cards on the table 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.220
 that is 60% of the charts in the table 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.570
 and it only cost you one 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.340
 turn of a dear 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.720
 to finish this move you have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 three more rounds of bidding 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.360
 but to see only two cards 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.950
 that's not very profitable 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.700
 the moment is therefore ideal to take 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.710
 a decision 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.570
 I have six cards or stay in the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.079
 blow and to be able to take this 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.550
 decision 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.120
 so we have to ask ourselves a few 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.120
 Questions 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 the first question to ask is very 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.969
 simple what game do you have to illustrate 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.980
 our purpose we will classify games 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 in two categories those we 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.739
 will call games made and games 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.739
 potential 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.610
 we are talking about game made when you have 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.530
 already a combination of five cards 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.710
 of a value at least equal to the land 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.960
 and those between your hand and the flop 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.979
 ie if you have people hand 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 be berre 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.630
 of father 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.040
 a set 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.670
 a fifth 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.439
 a color 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.960
 a full house 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630
 a square 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.310
 or a straight flush 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.500
 but unless you have the river lined yes 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.570
 you will only very rarely have a 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.090
 combination requiring five cards to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.980
 this stage of the game so much that the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.140
 fifths colors and stronger 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.950
 reason flash cards are rarely 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.560
 games made on the flop 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.000
 the second category of play refers to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.289
 games that are missing only one 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.920
 card to make a big 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.250
 combination 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.869
 so we talk about potential games they have 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 the possibility of becoming fat 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.730
 hands but they are not worth even a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.290
 pair as long as they are not made 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.209
 for example when you are missing 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.550
 a card to make your straight 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.550
 or your color is said that you are going 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.280
 a potential game we also speak of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.750
 draw game since you need shooting 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 and another map to be able to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.510
 achieve 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.510
 in this example we miss him
