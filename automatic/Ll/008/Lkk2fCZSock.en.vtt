00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 then crunchy crust is soft they are 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.330
 these are the two main features 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.730
 of the dish I am going to offer you today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.530
 or the potato routes it is about 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.150
 a side dish that originally came from Switzerland 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 which has taken hold very well also in 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.030
 italy can be enriched with lard 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.340
 pancetta spec 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.470
 I, however, want to offer you the most version 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 simple the natural one with potatoes 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 rosemary and thyme 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.640
 let's see how to try ingredients together 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.090
 400 g of potatoes 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.940
 extra virgin salt pepper salt and rosemary 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.489
 and 3 4 tablespoons of water the roasts that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.129
 I propose that you plan to blanch 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.260
 potatoes in water after grating them 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.690
 then to pass them in the pan but let's go 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.350
 step by step or peel the potatoes 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.520
 now I put it inside one 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.520
 grater with wide holes 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.860
 if you don't have the electric grater it goes 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.860
 manual mode is also good 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.039
 I gathered the potato julienne 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.960
 the inside of a basket simply 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.590
 to prevent the potatoes from going a little 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.950
 everywhere 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.409
 here I brought water to a boil 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.170
 the oxalate slightly I insert the 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.299
 basket with potatoes inside ok 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 so then we will be able to remove the potatoes 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.939
 so we also calculate very easily 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.100
 Maximum 23 minutes from the shooting 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.170
 of boiling because I do this 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.240
 to speed up the time to avoid 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.429
 to add too much oil in the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.720
 subsequent baking or better browning 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:37.119
 I would say in this case in the pan after three 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.700
 minutes with a potholder we do 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.470
 be careful not to burn yourself, remove the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.920
 basket of potatoes you see that is a lot 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.830
 simple even take it off ok we put to 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.240
 to dry five minutes I transferred to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.759
 finian potatoes inside one 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.369
 bowl flavored with a mince of 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.750
 rosemary and sage and I chose these 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.280
 aromatic herbs but they are also fine 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.690
 others I have tasted the potatoes are fine 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.539
 to stay otherwise add a 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:10.720
 little because before or salted the water 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:15.180
 I add so much see then 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.740
 I put a spoonful of oil now 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.230
 also the problem with roasts as it is 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.210
 what you need a lot of oil then 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.190
 we try to use all the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.090
 tricks to use the wine 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.990
 possible then a spoon in here 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.720
 not well drained the potatoes well so 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.130
 that I had a little bit of water left and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.780
 now in the june also another 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.930
 spoon because they have to finish the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.680
 cooking inside we move 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:55.750
 inside a pot with a diameter 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:57.459
 of 28 cm a day we heat it and we are 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.860
 two tablespoons of oil then us 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.160
 we will use a maximum of three 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.940
 four ok then a spoon inside 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.770
 potatoes 2 tablespoons here we wait about 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.490
 30 seconds so that the oil is beautiful 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:16.739
 hot transfer now to gather of 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.739
 potatoes stop the pan with oil 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.569
 so with a paddle we see them and 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.310
 we speak a layer not too often yes 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.310
 note an inch an inch 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.200
 let's try to flatten our own 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.200
 past is so 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.090
 we must make sure to create one 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.219
 crunchy crust below and above 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.079
 so first we'll do this 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:55.079
 crust on the base and we will leave 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:59.159
 cook the potatoes without lid for 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:06.000
 about 10 minutes over medium heat and then 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:08.669
 we see the steps after ten minutes at 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.260
 we are slightly the flame for other 2 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.780
 3 minutes so that you do if the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.750
 crust because we say first 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.199
 cooking continued ok and now we are 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.380
 making the crusts then 23 minutes e 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:25.110
 we also begin to always approach of 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.280
 plus the potatoes so that the starch 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.949
 inside the face remain attached 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.070
 when the crust has formed see 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.590
 that the potato pie moves 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.120
 inside the pan then we cover 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.889
 with the blankets we have to turn it over like 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.250
 were an omelette so this is the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:48.599
 part a little more delicate we say blow 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.650
 dry ok and let's slide ours 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:54.330
 broken in the pan 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.199
 we remove the potato residues that we have 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.199
 attacked 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:06.949
 we still give the form de rossi 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.419
 another five minutes over medium heat e 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:13.970
 then it's ready we are the reds is ready 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.449
 then we always put because usually 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.699
 we consider it blah and we turn to red from 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.830
 potatoes this is the result I have to say 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.590
 which is very inviting then if we want 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.379
 make a more elegant presentation 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.330
 instead of cooking all the potatoes 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.159
 together we can take from the pastry chefs 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.870
 maybe you know those kind tones 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.300
 cookie cutters so to speak from a 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.699
 methods 8 10 centimeters and achieve so 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.620
 our individual portions in this 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.680
 instead how I presented you today 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.389
 we can cut costs to pieces that 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.159
 then serve it as a side dish 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.050
 alternative as I told you before 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.819
 There are several versions you can 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.159
 enrich it with all that is there 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.409
 like most dates for anti tension 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.770
 I have to thank a di this time 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.560
 you 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.500
 or marco the wannebou for giving me 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.800
 the idea of this brilliant to hospital 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.800
 pasta
