you using memory unit as the main hard
drive

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
drive

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.650 
drive
you<00:02:22.770> take<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.910> if<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.630> a

you take that out so if you have a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.400 
you take that out so if you have a
memory<00:02:25.080> unit<00:02:25.410> down<00:02:25.590> in<00:02:25.830> here<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.959> take<00:02:28.200> all

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
memory unit down in here you take all

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.960 
memory unit down in here you take all
that<00:02:28.440> out<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.980> main<00:02:29.160> hard<00:02:29.400> early<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> be

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that out you main hard early to be

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.300 
that out you main hard early to be
unplugged<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.750> have<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.020> hard<00:02:31.290> road<00:02:31.530> over<00:02:32.280> here

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
unplugged I have a hard road over here

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.760 
unplugged I have a hard road over here
so<00:02:32.970> I'll<00:02:33.120> put<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:34.110> something<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.709> a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
so I'll put that like something like a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.290 
so I'll put that like something like a
memory<00:02:34.980> stick<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.340> are<00:02:35.430> having<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.820> take

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
memory stick that are having that take

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.330 
memory stick that are having that take
that<00:02:36.450> out<00:02:36.800> only<00:02:37.800> thing<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.070> needs<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.310> be

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that out only thing that needs to be

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.160 
that out only thing that needs to be
plugged<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> wireless<00:02:39.630> adapter<00:02:39.780> if

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
