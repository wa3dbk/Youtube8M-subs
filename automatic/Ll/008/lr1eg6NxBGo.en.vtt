liner the reason why I love this stuff

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.060 
liner the reason why I love this stuff
so<00:01:47.090> much<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.320> actually<00:01:48.440> really

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
so much and is this is actually really

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.780 
so much and is this is actually really
thin<00:01:49.520> pen<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:51.080> it's<00:01:51.590> not<00:01:51.740> like<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.980> pencil

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
thin pen so it's not like a pencil

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.030 
thin pen so it's not like a pencil
graphite<00:01:53.450> or<00:01:53.930> whatever<00:01:54.230> they<00:01:54.410> put<00:01:54.680> in<00:01:54.740> there

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
graphite or whatever they put in there

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.100 
graphite or whatever they put in there
so<00:01:55.430> it's<00:01:55.550> not<00:01:55.700> very<00:01:55.880> harsh<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:56.600> what<00:01:56.750> it<00:01:56.870> does

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
so it's not very harsh so what it does

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.100 
so it's not very harsh so what it does
it<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:57.800> kind<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.280> melts<00:01:58.910> into<00:01:59.090> your<00:01:59.210> skin<00:01:59.330> it

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
it just kind of melts into your skin it

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.570 
it just kind of melts into your skin it
is<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.890> little<00:02:01.220> bit<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.580> lot<00:02:01.730> darker

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.180 
brows and lashes grow and it's not a
gimmick<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.390> actually<00:03:09.810> works<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:10.890> have

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
gimmick it actually works but you have

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.070 
gimmick it actually works but you have
to<00:03:11.489> be<00:03:11.610> consistent<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.570> it's<00:03:13.019> just

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
to be consistent you have to it's just

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.020 
to be consistent you have to it's just
like<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.890> little<00:03:14.010> wand<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.820> comes

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
like it's a little wand and it comes

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.380 
like it's a little wand and it comes
with<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.239> gel<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.320> think<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.370> believe<00:03:17.970> there's

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
with a gel and I think I believe there's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.270 
with a gel and I think I believe there's
some<00:03:18.540> kind<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.780> peptides<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:20.040> kind<00:03:20.160> of

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
some kind of peptides in it that kind of

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.970 
some kind of peptides in it that kind of
make<00:03:20.519> your<00:03:20.790> stuff<00:03:21.239> grow<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:22.170> did<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.769> lot<00:03:22.950> of

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
make your stuff grow I did a lot of

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.009 
make your stuff grow I did a lot of
research<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.820> don't<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.300> stuff<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.660> not<00:03:24.840> like

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
research I don't the stuff is not like

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.509 
research I don't the stuff is not like
bad<00:03:25.230> for<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.590> or<00:03:25.709> anything<00:03:25.920> there<00:03:26.190> are<00:03:26.310> some

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
bad for you or anything there are some

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:27.860 
bad for you or anything there are some
side<00:03:26.700> effects<00:03:27.000> where<00:03:27.239> like<00:03:27.330> my<00:03:27.450> eyes<00:03:27.630> get<00:03:27.840> a

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
side effects where like my eyes get a

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.900 
side effects where like my eyes get a
little<00:03:27.930> bit<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.320> red<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.280> first<00:03:29.760> couple

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
little bit of red for the first couple

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.580 
little bit of red for the first couple
of<00:03:30.090> weeks<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.480> use<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.050> after<00:03:31.170> six

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
of weeks that I use this but after six

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.100 
of weeks that I use this but after six
weeks<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.519> will<00:03:32.670> notice<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.209> huge<00:03:33.720> huge

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
weeks you will notice a huge huge

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.240 
weeks you will notice a huge huge
difference<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> bit<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.190> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
difference so it is a bit of a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130 
difference so it is a bit of a
commitment<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.940> have<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.420> apply<00:03:36.630> this<00:03:36.690> every

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
commitment you have to apply this every

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.930 
commitment you have to apply this every
day<00:03:37.170> twice<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> day<00:03:37.800> and<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.459> makes<00:03:38.580> your<00:03:38.790> lashes

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
day twice a day and it makes your lashes

day twice a day and it makes your lashes
and<00:03:39.450> your<00:03:39.930> brows<00:03:40.170> grow<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:41.400> can<00:03:41.550> definitely
