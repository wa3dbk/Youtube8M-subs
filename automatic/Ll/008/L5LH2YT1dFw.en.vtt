 deleted and doing everything again went after 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.820
 that it was there in one of the last 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.510
 missions of the last levels and there I 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.060
 I bought the ideli okay, got nothing. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 tactics with an hour and forty-four 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.159
 against the quixadá I did not play 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.200
 a lot with it ok let's go there max life 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.900
 700 good life level 12 novelty 43 up to 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.490
 that is reasonable so that gives pro spent 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.409
 the armor 18 until it is good so too 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.409
 good legal settlement and could limit 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.579
 use them 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 ok they are a good attack so someone 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:45.570
 there what interests to improvement up and there 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.090
 appears careful to attack enemies 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.790
 Close with gloomy claw you tighten 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 turned down with the pet bottles 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.899
 extreme to set a trap 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.149
 magically animated let loose will jump 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.430
 causing enemies to give them 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.850
 You play this bear trap there and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.320
 she goes in the enemy someone awake 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.939
 quickly to attack with claws 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.640
 powerful with greater damage 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.610
 then you attack faster takes 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.350
 more damage with the claws and hold having 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 to set an abrupt trap 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.980
 Come back and toss it here just to get 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.140
 understand that battisti is rapidion that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.020
 you play something you already have 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.100
 hold you can aim where you will play 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.930
 the ones now do not change at all they had 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.940
 and improvement from above which is figure in 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.460
 to make a combo that launched the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.560
 enemies in the air you hold and give a 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.990
 kick the flying enemy 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.960
 ok the traps that exploded after 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.760
 little time causing damage causing 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.300
 damage between enemies in a large 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.090
 area 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.520
 good guys here I recommend the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.130
 I was a good choice from below or 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.350
 I remember because I really prefer 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.880
 because I use the attack much more 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.250
 With my hands I prefer a lot more because 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.100
 It's much faster he escaped with his hand. 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.100
 rather than with the claw until right 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.960
 of the claw okay né type takes damage 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.020
 Overall but I much prefer it above 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.240
 ok then I recommend the top one is for you 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.940
 here bringing a direction now more 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.650
 powerful that the greatest damage and that 's it people 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.360
 the square part quickly to 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.280
 fast claw attacks 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.350
 while attack hold square to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.940
 unleash a wild start 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:31.020
 powerful good then here when attacked the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.950
 secure square or secure when it gives 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.670
 an onslaught 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.320
 the thrust is that the triangle that is 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.490
 talking to you touches my career 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.610
 in the affection here she bites the 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.780
 face 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.530
 so this is good now let's see the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.269
 first line down to the ball part 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.019
 to kick a wave of sums one of the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.569
 enemies 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.220
 you kick a wave of shadow hold 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.500
 ball to peek for a short time 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.299
 causing enemies to touch you 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.250
 darkens the bullshit he gets very 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.010
 dark and goes black as well as 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.560
 he had invisible can say yes 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.360
 but he on the prowl for a short 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.739
 time then the enemy does not come for a 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.810
 short time 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.799
 life is increased this group is never 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.500
 finished 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.449
 increases life holds the ball to 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.340
 peek out of the narrow causing 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.870
 a large explosion that causes damage in 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.760
 name of the next ones how much you 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.400
 lurk you stay holding the ball 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.870
 when he has just one narrow leaves 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.570
 blast him so if you are 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.440
 stalking near a guy there you 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.090
 drop 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.370
 So it's going to be a blast on this guy. 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.100
 will have majority from top to bottom 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.930
 part ball to give a kick that throws 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.020
 shadow gets to school giving enemies 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.449
 distant from low ball to 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.979
 peeping move while lurking and 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.139
 Let me get the males a truck. 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.120
 cause a good enemies damage that same 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.910
 history has hours beyond this type 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.860
 of attack in which you have to walk 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.289
 he leaves a trail behind this 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.770
 enemy goes through the trail he suffers 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.970
 damages 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.560
 This is the same thing you're going to do. 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.919
 narrowing when you respect yourself 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.210
 walk slowly, what the hell are you? 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.620
 leave face behind you ok then I 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.780
 I did not like this because you have it. 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.639
 What do you have to walk to play? 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.470
 leave him the track for him to pass him 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.210
 lose damage so I prefer much more 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.460
 told me you just squeeze the ball and it goes 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.349
 taking off the wave neither you nor I can reach him 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.270
 You're already tyrannical, and you're going to be walking. 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.210
 leaving trails to traps 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.580
 enemy knows I go through ridiculous 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.780
 so I much prefer the top who 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.900
 and that is 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.870
 improved the attack and if from here too 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.490
 and here we have the safe game ball for 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.410
 peer and invisible who needs 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.389
 from shade to hide only makes 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.979
 one here you stay invisible for real 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.150
 invisible even if you do much more 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.060
 fast 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.860
 just to show you you only you 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.810
 miss you, you throw waves here 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.920
 if you hold the ball 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.570
 invisible op - you get even faster 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.290
 when you are invisible when you are 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.750
 peeking is not you go have no 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.940
 no secret when you leave 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.060
 respect for a drink 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.520
 to take the wave is basically me 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.440
 Closed I recommend everyone else 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.370
 to be very cool 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:22.700
 hey hey I think it's much cooler 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.890
 more interesting than the label because 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.830
 the other of maggi for him is cooler 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.720
 but what I think is a custom 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.280
 better to play with the public title 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.710
 had closed because I played too much 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.800
 he can be said to be 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.020
 It's newer here in my collection and good. 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.180
 But the day closed is very beautiful so at 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.890
 My god is very handsome so you can see 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.110

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.550

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.260
 You liked civilians. 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.570
