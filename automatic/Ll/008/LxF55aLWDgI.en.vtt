00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
through now just like doing your

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
through now just like doing your
bodywork<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.420> you're<00:01:09.600> shaping

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
first this is no different but basically

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
first this is no different but basically
we're<00:01:12.810> shaping<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.500> planing<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
we're shaping it or planing it from the
