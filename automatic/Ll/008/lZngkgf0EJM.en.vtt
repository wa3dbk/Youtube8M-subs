00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.530 
pressing than if he's off the ball
sounds<00:04:50.270> very<00:04:50.990> simple<00:04:51.910> our<00:04:52.910> safety<00:04:53.240> is<00:04:53.330> playing

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
sounds very simple our safety is playing

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.350 
sounds very simple our safety is playing
quite<00:04:53.720> deep<00:04:54.850> about<00:04:55.850> 20<00:04:56.210> yards<00:04:56.330> off<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.630> ball

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
quite deep about 20 yards off the ball

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.170 
quite deep about 20 yards off the ball
so<00:05:00.070> pushing<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.280> inside<00:05:01.550> still<00:05:01.790> doesn't<00:05:02.060> do<00:05:02.150> a

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
so pushing it inside still doesn't do a

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.340 
so pushing it inside still doesn't do a
whole<00:05:02.270> lot<00:05:02.420> so<00:05:02.720> there's<00:05:02.900> still<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.080> lot<00:05:03.320> of

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
whole lot so there's still a lot of

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.190 
whole lot so there's still a lot of
space<00:05:03.710> here<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:05.060> still<00:05:05.360> would<00:05:05.540> like<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.990> see

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
space here you still would like to see

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.690 
space here you still would like to see
that<00:05:06.410> right<00:05:06.590> on<00:05:06.770> letting<00:05:07.160> him<00:05:07.310> down<00:05:07.520> the

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
that right on letting him down the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.660 
that right on letting him down the
sideline<00:05:08.230> Jeffrey<00:05:09.230> does<00:05:09.410> a<00:05:09.440> good<00:05:09.680> move<00:05:09.920> and

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
sideline Jeffrey does a good move and

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.230 
sideline Jeffrey does a good move and
roads<00:05:11.660> really<00:05:12.020> just<00:05:12.290> gets<00:05:12.470> beat<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.150> think

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
roads really just gets beat and I think

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.330 
roads really just gets beat and I think
part<00:05:14.600> of<00:05:14.690> it<00:05:14.810> is<00:05:14.960> uh<00:05:16.930> he's<00:05:17.930> not<00:05:18.170> able<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:19.100> press

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
part of it is uh he's not able to press

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.460 
part of it is uh he's not able to press
on<00:05:19.550> this<00:05:19.700> play<00:05:22.780> but<00:05:23.780> probably<00:05:24.230> should<00:05:24.410> have

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
on this play but probably should have

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.320 
on this play but probably should have
been<00:05:24.620> touchdown<00:05:25.070> does<00:05:25.280> he<00:05:25.430> tip<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:25.730> at<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.240> end

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
been touchdown does he tip it at the end

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:35.530 
been touchdown does he tip it at the end
there<00:05:27.220> might<00:05:28.220> be<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.370> tipped<00:05:28.640> ball

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.350 
he does tip it silly it's a good rally
from<00:05:38.780> him<00:05:38.990> it's<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.680> good<00:05:39.830> job<00:05:40.040> to<00:05:40.850> rally<00:05:41.120> at
