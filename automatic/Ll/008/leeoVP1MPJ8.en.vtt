00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.980
 speak and alert the hayashi that serves 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 you, but the midfield was commented on and the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.269
 Today's video is obviously about call of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 ghosts again let's talk about 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 goals will be the main subject of the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.130
 channel for a good long time 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 probably because as you know 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 yesterday 14 was a worldwide revelation of the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.519
 multiplayer game mode right yesterday 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 I already brought you a video 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.269
 speaking the main novelties that the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 presented in the question of how 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 multiplayer as well as the live I 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 I did with guests during the store 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.320
 official trailer right of the Regulation 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.790
 and I bring you another video today to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 talk about one of the news that I 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.559
 I commented in yesterday's video that the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.719
 oab is moab guy was initially 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 being told that he was back and that 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.140
 video I want to explain to you the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 true situation because in Mohave 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.550
 true truth is not even a moab 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 ok let's go for parts 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.539
 first because this rumor has 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.579
 idea that the bike was back 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.899
 because in the trailer itself multiplayer 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 which I will still do an analysis 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.409
 for you a break from the is not yet 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.119
 can post on youtube 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 right is the risk of stress is very 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.570
 big on assets did not release policy 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.119
 did not bring the analysis to you yet 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.680
 I'll bring it as soon as possible. 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.720
 what happens in training and multiplayer has 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.030
 a scene where the character is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.250
 activating is a kick for the cell phone 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.049
 and then what the place so that the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 new way of activating crystalline in the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 code or if down there on the screen you 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 can see that it has a symbol of the oab 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.509
 computer down what the great 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.299
 Most people thought it is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.720
 if he was activating the map and the map 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.180
 was exploding sure happens in the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.939
 In fact, even this was a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.619
 a thunderstorm from the right infinity ward 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 first, if you analyze it calmly 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.640
 You'll see that when it shows 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.040
 this scene if frank is squeezing the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 button is the counter is already zeroed 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.759
 understood then is it not that he 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 was another player of the team 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.880
 him or the opposing team and released this 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 right moab 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.479
 another thing we have to observe 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.490
 A lot of people were talking about the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.380
 possibility of mobil 1 car pack because 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.390
 that same guy who lets go of what 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.940
 everybody was guessing it was the guy 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.700
 that he just took ab né he had just 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.530
 get a technical guy right there in the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.670
 car he catches the ball he catches the foot 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.650
 in the third person after we 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.690
 first person activating a strike 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.700
 in case everyone is supposed to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.950
 would be moab like i said was not this 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.959
 character that released fashion but rather gives 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090
 for you to get the abc on the carpet 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.230
 Calm down, let's go for parents. 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 enough attention following moab is not 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.360
 a quiz trick the coin code is a 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.920
 dynamic map event because it's you 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.870
 knows that the dynamic map is one of the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.730
 great news of the heat of goals and the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.030
 Oh, it's not really called fashion. 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.760
 It's called hodgkin strike, she's not. 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.730
 A strike you do not catch her killing me I know 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.590
 there is 20 25 30 without dying no it is not 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.940
 so what happens in the works 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.830
 video of yesterday I explained to you 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.989
 about something called warner movie the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.780
 movie order is a kind of a suitcase 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.940
 which is doped randomly in any 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.830
 game mode in any match 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.470
 and when you the character that picks up 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.610
 this queue order in that active bag in the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.709
 time a screen where he plans to complete 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.900
 within that game 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.000
 the daily rates vary are usually they 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.280
 they make enemies full when I am 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.140
 lying down kill someone with head shot kill 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.239
 three in a row without dying like that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.190
 Do you know how easy Cearenses are for you? 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.329
 completing this screen where you get a 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.910
 ad hoc caps that happens is and even pec 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.959
 can give you moab né the so-called odin 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.360
 strike 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.450
 only what happens is only one exists in 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.280
 a map that the map strike sound and was a 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.720
 of the maps shown so far and up to 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.359
 where I know at the event they only had 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.010
 three maps released right and the max ex 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.019
 man that map of which players 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.880
 own made the gameplay live 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.880
 during the live set that map well 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.820
 tight little little is that map there 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.799
 It's only on that map that it comes from the 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.329
 tina palace is what is the game design 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.739
 director of multiplayer mode 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.570
 she herself confirmed through the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.000
 twitter that is only on that map that 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.920
 It works today street for you to pick it up 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.140
 You have to be the first person in the 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.720
 starting the company will complete before 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.829
 April to be married every witch who left the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.079
 order is that the briefcase and pick up the carpet 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.880
 then the first pec I came through 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.940
 fil organ through to complete that besides 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.640
 already beat today and that her 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.530
 destination is what it does it changes the right map 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.120
 in that country that has already gone 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.400
 youtube of people who were there 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.979
 they could play you see when you 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.190
 active today strike is it kills all 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.750
 dm Similarly opponents had sex that 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.240
 does not finish the match or is not a 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.520
 The match does not end and neither does 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.380
 that mpe business and also the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.630
 map is the whole arrangement that which she 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.850
 comes w3 is when you had a fashion w3 the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.229
 time to stay with him for a minute and a 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.270
 the map is all orange until the end of 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.030
 My orange match starts this time. 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.860
 nothing happens and steep does not exist 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.500
 one map does not stay in another color 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.510
 but the map changes completely the map stays 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.520
 completely destroyed looks like another 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.650
 map is as if within that map 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.080
 within him maxflex ong existed two 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.360
 maps the map from which you start and map 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.010
 after the right jeans trick 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.630
 initially when I saw this I thought 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.370
 because I figured they would have 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.500
 made for all maps ie 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.630
 they had created a second version 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.760
 of all maps but not actually 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.490
 so the Chinese words spoken is just 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.539
 this map only in the abstract zone that is 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.880
 today strike 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.760
 apparently only gives to be the love 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.070
 absolute to be caught on the map strix ong 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.110
 and no longer works per system than 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.729
 usa is no more what secret strike 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.349
 equal was novelty 3 equal to woman 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.750
 increased 2 certain 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.490
 however it is not yet ruled out that 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.530
 possibility of being yes what the 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.510
 Secret strike sure you suddenly 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.460
 picks up the sound of the harp 25 that the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.900
 cinema is not known for what the 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.830
 people know that everyone thinks that 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.080
 oab is not the right ab then that a 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 call if the day strike comes do not want to 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.440
 but did not want to miss common and on the carpet 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.289
 that you take by the fil of the organ that 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.570
 that right bag and only works on the 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.940
 map strikes onu so they are not for 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.560
 all the maps of the game ok some 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.960
 details are yet to be given to 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.639
 It's all very early in the day and I let it go. 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.940
 This information I could not 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.169
 you until then ok smmp from another code 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.539
 because as I said it is not possible 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.560
 post gameplay of the safe goals for who 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.599
 was not at the event that does not have 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.430
 say official permission Actvision 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.960
 service you post you're running 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.000
 a great risk of strike 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.310
 but finally the information given is 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.380
 So the tip for you is not Moabita. 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.539
 it is called the district simply a 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.700
 dynamic map event is not a strike 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.440
 he kills the two opponents more 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.430
 It's not because I conquered it here in Portuguese. 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.860
 You do not have to can spread 0 bar 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.540
 10 0 neighborhood I do not know anything about you 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.180
 was the first face to complete 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.400
 challenge of one of a win in the 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.950
 whole match and play near your pec 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.660
 will give the pass an old street right all 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.890
 but that's a lot of information for 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.090
 I will still make an appointment for you. 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.710
 video only to talk about the gun just to 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.510
 Talk about it here just to talk 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.880
 about Henry has changed a lot 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.680
 To talk a lot, just waiting. 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.900
 really hit liberals this 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.550
 use of game place training and 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.600
 the more is it so stay tuned in 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.490
 channel because it can come to any 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.900
 moment and I'm going to stay here if 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.210
 liked and want to leave the cell phone chips 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:19.900
 favorite and only then a hug to everyone 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.900
 stay with god and even is one more
