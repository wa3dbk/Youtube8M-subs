 some interesting questions and interesting 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:44.539
 about the famous assaults that is the subject 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.039

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.210
 comments from the answer is like 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.559
 always if you enjoy the video do not forget 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.149

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.829
 subscribe for more daily videos of 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.949
 great cars cincoshop 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.430
 question number 1 the money you own 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.080
 is for only one character or for all 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.000
 good the money that wins during the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.159
 game is for each character ie 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.009
 once of a certain amount for maikel 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 for franklin for 3 each one each 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.280
 will have different amounts of money 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 for example what you win with franklin is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 what franklin is going to spend and nothing more to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.890
 he is going to spend is individual 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.120
 question number 2 what activities 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.660
 can do with the protagonists 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.550
 main good that has come out in the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.080
 trailer of the gameplay are many of the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.060
 things you can do outside of a mission 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.770
 how to play golf do acrobatics with 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.290
 aircraft random encounters with others 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.530
 characters throw themselves from parachute do 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.350
 business customize cars dive do 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.729
 yoga hunt I say there are lots of 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.420
 activities to do so 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.110
 getting bored is totally forbidden 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.939
 the third question is going to have clues in 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.630
 large both 5 as in the previous 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.100
 great cars the answer is positive 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.380
 confirmed 100 thousand percent of that 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.650
 there will be tricks chats keys so I do not know 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.170
 worry 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.960
 either individually or personally 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.490
 I will not use keys unless I 'm finished 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.200
 the game and I start another game and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.000
 start using keys to have fun 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.660
 simply and make the game easier 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.970
 but I would not use it because it reduces me 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.950
 reduce the fun question number 4 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.410
 big this car 5 will go out for the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.230
 computer 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.700
 look for now what is confirmed 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.730
 is that big up car 5 is going to come out 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.580
 for xbox 360 and playstation 3 but for 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.680
 computer 1 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.390
 but it is very probable although if it comes out 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.810
 it's not going to be the same day of release 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.570
 what big cars 5 for the consoles 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.780
 playstation3 and xbox question number 5 it 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.550
 you can dive obviously this already came out 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.230
 gameplay trailer is great this car 5 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.570
 you can dive for treasures and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.980
 use the kind of submarine that we have 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.230
 recently seen in trailers and 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.730
 images one of the weapons confirmed 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.420
 that we can use underwater is a 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.710
 knife and they will also see sharks 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.200
 but let's go to what is the missions of 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.850
 assault on big cars 5 assaults 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.460
 take place as the main activity 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.400
 and most important of the game will exist 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.990
 minor assaults that require preparation and 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.440
 Become an expert in the field of 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.780
 robots to then go to the robberies 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.540
 older, whatever the big assault or 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.030
 small you will need a preparation 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.560
 extensive to ensure a good plan for 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.570
 start you'll have to do many 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.950
 Tasks like validating security prove 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.870
 the response time of the police 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.240
 photograph the inside of certain 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.560
 buildings dry the village where are you going to 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.220
 do the theft and acquire vehicles 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.920
 insurance 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.380
 it's more expensive weapons and escape vehicles 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.060
 the list of things to do in each theft 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.560
 will vary and change according to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.110
 location and events that are 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.520
 taking place in certain areas 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.830
 you will also have to choose the way 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.290
 which you will carry out the assault or attacking 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.600
 whites using brute force or stealth 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.160
 with silencers to take advantage of the 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.170
 way in which they execute the assault 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.580
 will affect the amount of money you make 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.980
 and people who get hurt or killed 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.810
 during the assault you will also have to 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.940
 hire the right staff for the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.220
 work in your choice to whoever you want 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.110
 hire the cheap ones who are members 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.940
 inexperienced and po with little wisdom in the 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.799
 work or experts in the field that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.250
 they will take a bigger part of the money 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.720
 what is red 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.820
 you will be able to know the name 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.480
 specialty and skills offered 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.250
 each quantity and as not the percentage of 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.260
 money they will charge when completing each 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.180
 I jump these different characters 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.160
 additional fees you contract for 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.710
 Assaults may be expected to be made 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.050
 weapons or in different areas like 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.120
 hacker technical driver or muscles 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.520
 muscles are the ones to say 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.680
 shoot 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.020
 if you keep hiring them 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.800
 clear characters and survive the assault 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.810
 previous 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.610
 his skill will increase 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.129
 places that are going to wait to jump in 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.729
 Big 5 cars are banks jewelries 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:00.750
 shops and museums this obviously every 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.370
 place will have a different difficulty 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.979
 to steal for example a bank where 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.259
 you can get a lot of money goes to 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.970
 being very protected is going to be a robbery 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.240
 difficult like the museums where 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.409
 you can steal valuable objects 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.740
 then they will be waiting for it to be 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:20.229
 very protected very well this has been all 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.750
 this one wanted to leave the question of which 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.669
 it will be his way of committing an assault on 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.560
 stealth without anyone discovering you and not 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.360
 have conflict with the police or all 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.669
 noises or kill everything that is 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.560
 go through and take what you can that 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.150
