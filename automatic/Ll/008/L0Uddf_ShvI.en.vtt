center forward towards the end where yet

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.510 
center forward towards the end where yet
she<00:02:09.929> probably<00:02:10.440> made<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> big<00:02:10.890> impact<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
she probably made a big impact the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520 
she probably made a big impact the
money's<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> wing

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
money's on the wing

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.550 
money's on the wing
and<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:13.310> sent<00:02:13.550> for<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.880> left<00:02:14.060> wing<00:02:14.240> where<00:02:14.560> they

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and it sent for the left wing where they

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.590 
and it sent for the left wing where they
were<00:02:15.770> quite<00:02:16.250> an<00:02:16.550> important<00:02:17.120> position<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:17.540> him

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
were quite an important position for him

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600 
were quite an important position for him
but<00:02:17.780> he<00:02:17.840> will<00:02:18.380> stairs<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.190> wing<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.490> my

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
but he will stairs a right wing in my

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.570 
but he will stairs a right wing in my
opinion<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.060> fifa<00:02:20.720> 14<00:02:20.900> he<00:02:21.770> also<00:02:21.920> had<00:02:22.160> four<00:02:22.370> star

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
opinion on fifa 14 he also had four star

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.070 
opinion on fifa 14 he also had four star
skills<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.510> he'll<00:02:23.630> carry<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> mower

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
skills and I think he'll carry the mower

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.230 
skills and I think he'll carry the mower
definitely<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.770> bunch<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.280> c14<00:02:25.670> cut<00:02:26.000> then<00:02:26.120> I've

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
definitely a bunch of c14 cut then I've

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.210 
definitely a bunch of c14 cut then I've
made<00:02:26.360> an<00:02:26.510> 83<00:02:27.080> rated<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.680> I've<00:02:27.920> had<00:02:28.100> you

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
made an 83 rated so I've had you

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.309 
made an 83 rated so I've had you
downgraded<00:02:28.640> him<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.000> if<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.959> watch<00:02:30.140> the

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
downgraded him and if you watch the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.350 
downgraded him and if you watch the
Confederations<00:02:30.890> Cup<00:02:30.950> he<00:02:31.280> was<00:02:31.400> pretty<00:02:31.790> poor<00:02:32.120> am

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
Confederations Cup he was pretty poor am

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.970 
Confederations Cup he was pretty poor am
I<00:02:32.600> know<00:02:32.660> he's<00:02:32.900> having<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.200> cover<00:02:33.319> for<00:02:33.560> Danielle

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
I know he's having to cover for Danielle

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.190 
I know he's having to cover for Danielle
birds<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.340> overlap<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.730> lot<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.540> when<00:02:36.080> he

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
birds on the overlap a lot but when he

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.449 
birds on the overlap a lot but when he
had<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> chances<00:02:36.980> he<00:02:37.010> wasn't<00:02:37.340> really

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
had like the chances he wasn't really

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.640 
had like the chances he wasn't really
taking<00:02:37.640> them<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.239> he<00:02:38.630> in<00:02:38.870> my<00:02:38.900> opinion<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.560> lot

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
taking them and he in my opinion a lot

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.920 
taking them and he in my opinion a lot
of<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.830> agree<00:02:40.160> me<00:02:40.340> as<00:02:40.430> well<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.850> don't<00:02:41.569> think<00:02:41.810> he

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
of you agree me as well I don't think he

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.960 
of you agree me as well I don't think he
impressed<00:02:42.260> too<00:02:42.440> much<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.800> an<00:02:42.920> 83<00:02:43.400> rating<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
impressed too much so an 83 rating and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.440 
impressed too much so an 83 rating and
that's<00:02:44.750> why<00:02:44.900> I've<00:02:45.260> downgraded<00:02:45.860> space<00:02:46.040> by<00:02:46.280> two

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
that's why I've downgraded space by two

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.640 
that's why I've downgraded space by two
ice<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.750> think<00:02:48.019> that's<00:02:48.080> about<00:02:48.260> right<00:02:48.500> he

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
ice but I think that's about right he

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.500 
ice but I think that's about right he
didn't<00:02:48.860> doesn't<00:02:49.130> seem<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.430> quick<00:02:49.640> as<00:02:49.760> 90<00:02:50.150> he<00:02:50.450> is

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.580 
get himself 21 goals and 18 assists this
is<00:04:43.030> actually<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.450> most<00:04:43.780> prolific<00:04:44.050> season

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
is actually the most prolific season

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.320 
is actually the most prolific season
goal<00:04:44.800> scorer<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:45.160> wise<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.520> think<00:04:46.030> he's<00:04:46.180> ever

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
goal scorer and wise I think he's ever

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.050 
goal scorer and wise I think he's ever
had<00:04:46.630> them<00:04:46.900> definitely<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.730> think<00:04:48.730> he's<00:04:48.910> at

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
had them definitely I think he's at

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.910 
had them definitely I think he's at
least<00:04:49.180> 21<00:04:49.840> goals<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.230> good<00:04:50.440> amount<00:04:50.650> for<00:04:50.890> a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
least 21 goals a good amount for a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.310 
least 21 goals a good amount for a
winger<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:52.120> also<00:04:52.240> got<00:04:52.450> him<00:04:52.510> 18<00:04:52.870> assists<00:04:53.170> so

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
winger and it also got him 18 assists so

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.230 
winger and it also got him 18 assists so
he<00:04:53.440> wasn't<00:04:53.620> just<00:04:53.950> their<00:04:54.130> goal<00:04:54.340> scorer<00:04:54.640> he<00:04:55.090> was

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
he wasn't just their goal scorer he was

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.970 
he wasn't just their goal scorer he was
a<00:04:55.390> good<00:04:55.570> playmaker<00:04:56.110> as<00:04:56.320> well<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:56.890> I'm

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
a good playmaker as well so I'm

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.220 
a good playmaker as well so I'm
upgrading<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.430> an<00:04:57.670> 83<00:04:58.240> rated<00:04:58.690> right<00:04:58.930> winger

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
upgrading to an 83 rated right winger

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.930

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
changes I work other than that not too

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.480 
changes I work other than that not too
much<00:05:13.840> they<00:05:14.050> changed<00:05:14.470> for<00:05:14.620> theo<00:05:14.770> walcott<00:05:15.190> apart

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
much they changed for theo walcott apart

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.860 
much they changed for theo walcott apart
from<00:05:15.669> probably<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.210> lot<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.390> in<00:05:16.510> gamestats

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
from probably a lot of in gamestats

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.290 
from probably a lot of in gamestats
could<00:05:17.140> be<00:05:17.230> up<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.380> bit<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:18.430> three<00:05:18.700> rating<00:05:18.850> I

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
could be up to bit and a three rating I

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.790 
could be up to bit and a three rating I
think<00:05:19.540> that's<00:05:19.660> about<00:05:19.780> right<00:05:20.080> for<00:05:20.350> Theo<00:05:20.620> woke
