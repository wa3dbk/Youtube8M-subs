00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 and the multiplayer people back here 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.810
 after a long time less beard less hair 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.760
 so it seems they have aged 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.260
 all together however it was so much that not 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.379
 I showed myself I missed a little 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.300
 tell the truth, no, it's ok anyway 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.560
 it took me so long to do these things 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.090
 review why I did a little one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.859
 general upgrade which are words he has 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.539
 redone the computer so you can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.949
 propose the brigade you very long 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.269
 higher than in the past 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.099
 it took me so long to come out 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.779
 this review because i wanted it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.059
 practically starting over again on a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.739
 totally different game however onwards 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.329
 it really has it much higher so 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.620
 make them better appreciate my videos 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.030
 that said let's not waste any more time 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 we immediately work on the game of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 arcs from my last review are 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.170
 at the time of statues of the museum of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.539
 horrors 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 in fact for a couple of months it has not been released 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.039
 then nothing really horror 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.199
 but then all of a sudden it came 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.480
 out a game that has depopulated and that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.699
 it is still very popular on youtube law 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.699
 in question is fight night 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.060
 initially when it came out I must be 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.540
 honest I didn't even understand it was 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.960
 a horror 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.960
 then he played fucking if it's horror 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.290
 the game opens with a nice people on 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.210
 newspaper in which it is written that 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.860
 pizzeria is looking for a guardian 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.000
 night 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.270
 you will understand this crisis is a boon from 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.409
 heaven and in fact time five seconds 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 we are already manufacturer has made the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.640
 our first night of work 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.170
 the night is private speaks of the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.170
 old guardian who begins by saying 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.040
 if the two factions that is that there is not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.950
 tell you all the fucking time and how 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.780
 a fairy tale 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.580
 then besides this it tells us a lot about 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 but other things I honestly don't have 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.789
 got an ass 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.890
 while I'm type, his continues 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.330
 kilometric monologue we will start a 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.800
 take the hand with the various controls and 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.490
 with the structure of the game is not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.229
 complicated 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.940
 we will simply switch was the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.470
 camera to the other to check 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.190
 what happens in the structure and act of 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.380
 result 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.820
 it is certain that we will be able to do a lot in the end 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.030
 everything is reduced in more than two doors 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.950
 turn on two lights enough and would have 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.620
 consideration to be made at this point the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.319
 first but how big the fuck is st 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.829
 pizzeria rooms and even corridors 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.430
 a sort of small theater was Madonna 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.260
 and the second but a clean one and not me 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.690
 I think I've never seen a place 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.280
 crumbling and badly put like this the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.989
 quite slow game indeed there 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.630
 will be full minutes where it was 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.510
 practically nothing however to a certain one 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.160
 point the drama in fact will not be 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.489
 hard to notice holds deposits 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.890
 pupazzoni someone will miss the call 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.320
 it is in fact one and in some cases even more 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.880
 one of those hellish ones was 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.519
 heading towards you to make the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.989
 you are definitely going to party 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.870
 asking but something to do 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.670
 inside an acute observation pizzeria 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.950
 well you should know that this pizzeria is 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.840
 specialized in children's parties but 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.820
 I don't want to be picky 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.010
 however, I would like to return to all 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.010
 children who follow us now children you 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.049
 in front of a puppet like that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.370
 you would think it joyful or you would feel 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.350
 the instinct to pull your eyes out a 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.709
 forkful while not seeing so much o 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.730
 I don't know for the second one 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.019
 you 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.060
 the goal of the game is to survive from 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.840
 midnight until 6 am and one 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.849
 once done the game goes on with the 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.659
 second night 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.579
 slowly my dear friend my guardian 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.650
 I understand the crisis I understand that one must 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.319
 arrive later this month and understand all the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.709
 difficulties of the world but if you survive 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.480
 a night of killer puppets like 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.090
 fuck you see yourself coming back to 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.700
 I work the night after 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.409
 spot I would escape on the first shuttle 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.409
 available on marquez other than 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.900
 The time has come to pay ours 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.579
 dear factors be what we are 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.870
 will let you understand how much consumer and 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.730
 wants our vocal cords 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.049
 by dint of voting for the first scares 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.939
 said of the game turns out to be 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.469
 quite slow as it can 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:16.690
 seem strange this feature 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.310
 increases greatly with the s factor 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.419
 indeed as it is true that they will be there 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.430
 of the minutes does not happen practically 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.020
 nothing and even less that there will be minors 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.460
 where we should be quick to move 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.500
 to prevent your liking 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.599
 pupazzoni this contrast will put you a 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.949
 nice little anxiety 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.599
 in this game it's nice that you see 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.160
 we will check the cameras via the 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.440
 pizzeria but it is also true that in summer 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.570
 we 'll be in our little room 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.070
 hard then ghani and probably 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.050
 containing some deadly disease 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.180
 giving against and hygiene and easily 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.190
 reachable pose the problem what it is 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.900
 well the problem is that 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.550
 if we will be Swiss companies among the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.620
 various cameras we will not be able to see what 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.360
 it happens in our room and if not 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.960
 be careful they may occur 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.400
 bacon drawbacks a certain i the 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:05.410
 regatta stock that has acquitted in one 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:08.220
 way where engines are cazzola is a 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.220
 us too 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.880
 the first thing he would mind to do 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.370
 barricade yourself inside and close the doors but 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.410
 for God's sake do not do the doors 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.699
 they consume a lot of energy and if 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.650
 this will arrive at 0 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.650
 you will be absolutely screwed 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.579
 and who moves 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.540
 You are welcome 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.319
 this game is really tough from 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:15.650
 classify fps no management 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:19.280
 well no graphic adventure I wouldn't say 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.139
 ok ago united pretis makes category if the 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.280
 game is very light it makes sense to talk 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.449
 minimum requirements since 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.090
 probably the banks start on a 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.220
 computer was clementoni the game 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.060
 probably one of the most minimal but 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.800
 the facts 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.569
 no particular animations nothing 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.610
 creepy sound and no super graphics 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:35.599
 yet despite this flatness 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.970
 general 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.440
 the game is really valuable a 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.020
 dimension of the fact that in a game 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.250
 the technical aspect although important is not 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.250
 it is certainly the fundamental one 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.790
 phinet freddy's all came together 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.160
 and everything together has turned the world upside down 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.690
 of the indie a game came out 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.730
 practically nothing concentrates 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.000
 attention to oneself is still talked about 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.170
 of himself and even the 2 already came out 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.120
 a very pleasant surprise that is 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.560
 managed to break the flatness that makes the 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.400
 characterize the last months of the world 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.400
 england 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.490
 and here we come to our summary 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.220
 snow where we put black on white that 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.380
 it means the game for mainardis we have 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.280
 a 7 for the seven and a half gameplay for 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.900
 the s factor 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.400
 and serves the technique in one way 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.930
 total of 7 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.910
 having said that it concludes in this 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.770
 our new review or still sorry 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.300
 for the huge amount of time 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.680
 that if placed in the old review 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.420
 this new review 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.300
 I hope you enjoyed the new model 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.950
 for the general upgrade of mine 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.270
 video and I recommend if you have any 

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.830
 we will let you know in the review 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.710
 in the comments because I am very happy 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.940
 of meeting said this precisely because 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.940
 to write it everyone eats
