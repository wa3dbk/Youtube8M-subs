00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to work with a smaller window it makes

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.760 
to work with a smaller window it makes
it<00:01:36.569> a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.719> easier<00:01:37.109> moving<00:01:37.439> stuff<00:01:37.619> around

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it a little easier moving stuff around

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
it a little easier moving stuff around
now<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.609> start<00:01:38.969> there<00:01:39.149> now<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.600> add<00:01:39.810> an

out to white fade out to black let's try

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.279 
out to white fade out to black let's try
that<00:01:57.840> we'll<00:01:58.709> just<00:01:58.740> drag<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.280> onto<00:01:59.429> there<00:02:00.289> now

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
that we'll just drag it onto there now

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.800 
that we'll just drag it onto there now
let's<00:02:01.770> go<00:02:01.890> back<00:02:02.009> timeline<00:02:02.700> view<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.630> gonna

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
let's go back timeline view I'm gonna

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.569 
let's go back timeline view I'm gonna
move<00:02:03.959> this<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.319> pointer<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.489> we
