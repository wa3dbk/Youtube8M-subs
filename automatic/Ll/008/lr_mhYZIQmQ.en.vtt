 filled with the luxury of presenting 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.199

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.960

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:33.229
 there is no quality that we miss quality 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.870

 If Greece is not good, we're fine 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.930
 the truth that is very good do not tell me 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.369
 that comes to the white the tigers because 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.520
 we are in need of violent means 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.979
 we are in need of a flying medium 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.910
 as it says as ferretti tuca says one 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.910
 half flyer with arrival 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.570

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.609
 we come with the flash people so 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.649
 good that on Sunday we have a 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.030
 shared and good we are by 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.329
 That path is very happy to be here 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.429
 and to greet him suddenly 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.700
 suddenly we tell those people a 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:55.149
 old match of tigers against you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.479
 I say puebla tigers necaxa tigers against 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.270
 and we see every goal and sale every wall and 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.259
 we see every play we see those centers 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.280
 with the whistle silvera and it seems to me 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.170
 I wanted to ask you this question and not what 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.900
 we value 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.900
 voltaire we really gave the value to 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.930
 walter gaitán this you feel that you 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.739
 We are due to owe that for 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.690
 Any reason this does not steal from us and I 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.220
 I think it should not all that is what 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.710
 I lived here 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.530
 many times in life that it takes 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.110
 decisions rather regular one can be 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.810
 wrong but but the treatment I had 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.520
 here for so long the truth that 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.420
 then one with time when it is 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:48.290
 out of what professional football is 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.349
 high performance 1b baby appreciation 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.270

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:59.110
 very good always always praise 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.420
 and good at the time I always tried 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.090
 to give the best but one can 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.090
 wrong many times like that but but 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.190
 not the truth, I do not have anything to 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.490
 reproach or if they did not value me 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.800
 they gave me my place they wanted me as 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.390
 footballer as a person many people like that 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.330
 that the truth that I am very grateful and 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.140
 very happy to come back after so much 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.960
 time and good a new adventure with the 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.880

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.260
 when the classic tigers against 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.690
 monterrey and always to the cord today 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.310
 we say we want players from 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.500
 classic I do not know if in the time that is 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.020
 we said the same thing because sometimes 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.670
 we are insatiable we do not fill 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.350
 with the quality of the genes of the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.080
 players that bring us pass because 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.150
 I was kléber I was in cuc and I was in 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.850
 another this boy as he is called the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.240
 purpose exists but the Sixt Peralta 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.660
 were you Spanish was in campaign 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.120
 with the three big clubs 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.820
 not the truth that they were split 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.510
 and moments that every time they come what 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.740
 I try to follow and they talk to me suddenly 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.870
 for to 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.670
 to talk about about classic about what 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.920

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.300

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.930
 that they can follow things well 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.860

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.090

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:38.310
 I totally do not know otherwise otherwise 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.370
 similar case could be that case of 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.379
 this boy who was in kansas city 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:50.949

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:57.460
 that being American player 720 kilos 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.949
 he told him I'm not going to run here 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.219
 with this girl and asked for permission eight 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:05.650
 days and the team coach of the kansas 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:09.060
 and told him to come and play and he came in 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.240
 play 85 for pleasure and could not stand a 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.180
 training a workout for 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.759
 section different things and there's what 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.270
 I have the possibility to be well and 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:24.940
 try to fit into what is this 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.380
 new adventure for me then but with 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.110
 some confidence that he could do it 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:34.720
 so I wanted to see it anyway we're going to 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.449
