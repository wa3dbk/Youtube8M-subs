00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you can see there's mesh pretty much all

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.020 
you can see there's mesh pretty much all
around<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.240> boot<00:02:06.740> which<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.489> really

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
around the boot which is actually really

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.020 
around the boot which is actually really
good<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.679> when<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> play<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.459> pretty<00:02:11.730> hot

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
good because when I play it's pretty hot

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.059 
good because when I play it's pretty hot
outside<00:02:12.209> so

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
outside so

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.750 
outside so
I<00:02:13.099> don't<00:02:13.879> want<00:02:14.000> my<00:02:14.090> feet<00:02:14.329> to<00:02:14.890> be<00:02:15.890> all<00:02:16.099> hot<00:02:16.489> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
I don't want my feet to be all hot and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.789 
I don't want my feet to be all hot and
sweaty<00:02:16.969> I<00:02:17.209> want<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.659> breathe<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.620> that's

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
sweaty I want it to breathe so that's

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.000 
sweaty I want it to breathe so that's
why<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> got<00:02:19.189> these<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.480> they<00:02:20.930> allow<00:02:21.290> air<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.859> go

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
why I got these so they allow air to go

mesh<00:04:44.389> material<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:46.310> allows<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.729> to

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
mesh material and it allows you to

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.420 
mesh material and it allows you to
breathe<00:04:47.030> obviously<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:48.190> cool<00:04:49.190> thing<00:04:49.370> about

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
breathe obviously a cool thing about

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.400 
breathe obviously a cool thing about
this<00:04:49.789> tongue<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.360> that<00:04:50.479> it<00:04:50.600> actually<00:04:50.750> has<00:04:51.110> uh

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
this tongue is that it actually has uh

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.570 
this tongue is that it actually has uh
know<00:04:52.280> if<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.430> can<00:04:52.580> see<00:04:53.949> but<00:04:54.949> it<00:04:55.130> has<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> little

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
know if you can see but it has a little

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.300 
know if you can see but it has a little
curve<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.270> so<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.139> will<00:04:57.289> catch<00:04:57.620> debris<00:04:57.889> if

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
curve to it so it will catch debris if

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:06.969 
curve to it so it will catch debris if
it<00:04:58.520> falls<00:04:58.820> in<00:04:58.970> there<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:05.440> overall<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.949> very

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
it falls in there and overall a very

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:15.159 
it falls in there and overall a very
great<00:05:07.550> boot

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169
