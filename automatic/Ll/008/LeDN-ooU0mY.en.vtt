00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
corner and just flip it over now it's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
corner and just flip it over now it's
important<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:07.409> when<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.680> flip<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.950> over<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
important that when you flip it over you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
important that when you flip it over you
don't<00:01:09.149> flip<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.899> right<00:01:10.140> back<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.649> top<00:01:10.880> leave<00:01:11.880> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
don't flip it right back on top leave it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
don't flip it right back on top leave it
up<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.509> top<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.710> bottom<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
up at the top or up at the bottom a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
up at the top or up at the bottom a
little<00:01:14.310> bit<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> does<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.080> allows

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
little bit what that does that allows

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.230 
little bit what that does that allows
you<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.860> come<00:01:17.070> back<00:01:17.220> later<00:01:17.280> flip<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> back

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you to just come back later flip it back

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.690 
you to just come back later flip it back
over<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.289> you<00:01:19.380> leave<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.590> exactly<00:01:19.950> on

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
over because if you leave it exactly on

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.380 
over because if you leave it exactly on
there<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.869> got<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.229> back<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.649> recount<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
there you got to go back and recount it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.480 
there you got to go back and recount it
to<00:01:24.390> flip<00:01:24.950> whereas<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.039> you<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.310> leave<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to flip whereas if you just leave it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.059 
to flip whereas if you just leave it
forward<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.149> bit<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.340> clip<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
forward a little bit you can clip it

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.669 
forward a little bit you can clip it
okay<00:01:32.069> so<00:01:32.759> those<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.209> beginner<00:01:33.600> ways<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
okay so those are just beginner ways and

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.029 
okay so those are just beginner ways and
an<00:01:35.069> intermediate<00:01:35.819> way<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.799> a

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
an intermediate way would be to get a

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.240 
an intermediate way would be to get a
pinky<00:01:38.399> break<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.319> the<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.649> thing<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
pinky break so you do the same thing you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.510 
pinky break so you do the same thing you
count<00:01:41.549> two<00:01:41.970> cards<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.600> card<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.380> card<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
count two cards what card to card and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.560 
count two cards what card to card and
just<00:01:44.700> stick<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.030> pinky<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.479> there

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
just stick your pinky in there

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.390 
just stick your pinky in there
now<00:01:47.110> if<00:01:47.260> you<00:01:47.350> cover<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.740> with<00:01:47.830> your<00:01:48.010> hand<00:01:48.250> or

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
now if you cover it with your hand or

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.820 
now if you cover it with your hand or
something<00:01:48.820> you<00:01:49.330> can't<00:01:49.630> tell<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.290> can<00:01:50.409> even<00:01:50.680> do

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
something you can't tell you can even do

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.550 
something you can't tell you can even do
this<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.190> most<00:01:51.280> people<00:01:51.640> won't<00:01:51.760> notice<00:01:52.560> what

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
this and most people won't notice what

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.219 
this and most people won't notice what
you<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.010> do<00:01:54.159> that<00:01:54.400> is<00:01:54.610> slide<00:01:55.450> your<00:01:55.690> finger<00:01:55.990> in

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
you can do that is slide your finger in

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.820 
you can do that is slide your finger in
come<00:01:56.620> up<00:01:57.150> clip

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.420 

so<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.550> looks<00:02:01.580> really<00:02:02.570> nice<00:02:02.960> really<00:02:03.770> smooth

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.779 

and<00:02:07.550> how<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.030> go<00:02:08.570> from<00:02:08.750> here<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.380> if<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.490> hold

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
and how I go from here is a if you hold

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.690 
and how I go from here is a if you hold
all<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.780> corners<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:13.010> pulled<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.400> bottom

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
all of the corners you pulled the bottom

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.480 
all of the corners you pulled the bottom
right<00:02:13.880> with<00:02:14.030> your<00:02:14.330> pinky<00:02:14.840> your<00:02:15.680> flush<00:02:16.280> your

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
thumb comes here actually don't hold the

thumb comes here actually don't hold the
bottom<00:02:19.040> right<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:20.030> your<00:02:20.270> thumb<00:02:20.510> comes<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
bottom right but your thumb comes to the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.640 
bottom right but your thumb comes to the
top<00:02:21.400> what<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:22.730> do<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.140> your<00:02:24.140> index<00:02:24.410> finger

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
top what you can do is your index finger

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.820 
top what you can do is your index finger
like<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:25.540> allows<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.720> can<00:02:26.840> clip<00:02:26.990> it<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
like this allows you can clip it and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.180 
like this allows you can clip it and
throw<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.160> down<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:30.110> cards<00:02:30.560> will<00:02:30.890> stay

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
throw it down and the cards will stay

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.949 
throw it down and the cards will stay
together<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.240> know<00:02:32.360> when<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.540> lift<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.810> up

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
together so you know when you lift it up

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.160 
together so you know when you lift it up
cards<00:02:33.770> will<00:02:33.920> stay<00:02:34.070> together<00:02:34.220> okay<00:02:34.990> you<00:02:35.990> can

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
cards will stay together okay you can

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.770 
cards will stay together okay you can
just<00:02:36.410> throw<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:37.190> down<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> cards<00:02:37.940> well<00:02:38.120> you

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
just throw it down in the cards well you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.510 
just throw it down in the cards well you
know<00:02:38.900> fall<00:02:39.140> apart<00:02:39.470> both<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.190> looks<00:02:40.340> more

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
know fall apart both it looks more

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.850 
know fall apart both it looks more
realistic<00:02:40.820> instead<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.570> going<00:02:42.320> like<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.560> if

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
realistic instead of going like that if

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.120 
realistic instead of going like that if
you<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.900> here's<00:02:44.900> what<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.290> do<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.680> which<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
you just here's what I do it which is a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.430 
you just here's what I do it which is a
pretty<00:02:46.370> expert<00:02:46.880> method<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.870> might<00:02:48.020> see<00:02:48.260> other

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
pretty expert method you might see other

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.949 
pretty expert method you might see other
people<00:02:48.890> do<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.280> way<00:02:49.550> is<00:02:49.790> make<00:02:50.660> sure<00:02:50.690> you

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
people do it this way is make sure you

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.540 
people do it this way is make sure you
bevel<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.590> cards<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.010> little<00:02:52.040> bit<00:02:52.370> and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
bevel the cards a little bit and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.380 
bevel the cards a little bit and
basically<00:02:52.940> what<00:02:53.120> Bev<00:02:53.360> way<00:02:53.570> means<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:55.390> so

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
basically what Bev way means is so

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.140 
basically what Bev way means is so
there's<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.630> nice<00:02:56.780> little<00:02:56.989> downward<00:02:57.320> slope<00:02:58.150> all

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
there's a nice little downward slope all

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.080 
there's a nice little downward slope all
I<00:02:59.209> do<00:02:59.300> is<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.810> take<00:03:00.020> my<00:03:00.230> index<00:03:00.440> finger<00:03:00.910> all<00:03:01.910> right

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
I do is I take my index finger all right

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.229 
I do is I take my index finger all right
hand<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:03.200> run<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.770> side<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:04.970> can

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
hand and I run up the side and I can

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.830 
hand and I run up the side and I can
talk<00:03:05.390> two<00:03:05.660> cars<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.440> then<00:03:06.770> I

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
talk two cars and then I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.280 

so<00:03:09.379> that's<00:03:09.530> speed<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.010> looks<00:03:10.190> about<00:03:10.550> right<00:03:11.290> so

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
so that's speed it looks about right so

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.320 
so that's speed it looks about right so
we're<00:03:12.470> saying<00:03:12.650> for<00:03:13.069> your<00:03:13.910> card<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:17.060> what<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.239> do

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
we're saying for your card so what I do

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.470 
we're saying for your card so what I do
is<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.810> take<00:03:17.959> my<00:03:18.110> index<00:03:18.319> finger<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.150> run<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
is I take my index finger and run up the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.339 
is I take my index finger and run up the
side<00:03:20.690> counterpart<00:03:21.819> two<00:03:22.819> coats<00:03:23.739> three<00:03:24.739> cards

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
side counterpart two coats three cards

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.940 
side counterpart two coats three cards
to<00:03:27.349> card<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.040> once<00:03:28.819> i<00:03:28.879> get<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.090> my<00:03:29.120> knuckle<00:03:29.629> i

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
to card and once i get to my knuckle i

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.330 
to card and once i get to my knuckle i
square<00:03:30.950> everything<00:03:31.219> out<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:33.170> down

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
square everything out of it down

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.640 
square everything out of it down
that<00:03:34.970> looks<00:03:35.239> really<00:03:35.330> realistic<00:03:36.019> plus<00:03:36.530> you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
that looks really realistic plus you

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350 
that looks really realistic plus you
don't<00:03:36.769> have<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.069> hold<00:03:37.280> any<00:03:37.459> breaks<00:03:37.819> because<00:03:38.269> if

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
don't have to hold any breaks because if

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.449 
don't have to hold any breaks because if
you<00:03:38.450> hold<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.870> break<00:03:39.080> there<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.890> chance

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
you hold a break there is the chance

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.820 
you hold a break there is the chance
that<00:03:40.640> someone<00:03:40.970> can<00:03:41.120> see<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.450> really<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.470> double

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
that someone can see you really a double

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.240 
that someone can see you really a double
lift<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.190> any<00:03:43.430> way<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.819> want<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.180> do<00:03:44.360> it

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
lift is any way that you want to do it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.000 
lift is any way that you want to do it
there's<00:03:46.840> no<00:03:47.840> double<00:03:48.140> F<00:03:48.290> like<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.709> if<00:03:48.890> you

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
there's no double F like that if you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.949 
there's no double F like that if you
want<00:03:49.220> where<00:03:49.849> how<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> did<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.420> once<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.870> took

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
want where how I did that once I took

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.380 
want where how I did that once I took
the<00:03:51.200> pinky<00:03:51.530> break<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.640> instead<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.120> lifting

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
the pinky break and instead of lifting

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
the pinky break and instead of lifting
it<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.930> took<00:03:54.170> my<00:03:54.620> thumb<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.150> rotated<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.290> on

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
it I took my thumb and I rotated it on

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.559 
it I took my thumb and I rotated it on
the<00:03:57.560> common<00:03:58.040> question<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.489> you'll<00:03:59.390> see

one<00:04:08.000> where<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.450> can<00:04:08.510> just<00:04:08.709> rotate<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:10.599> right

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
one where you can just rotate it right

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
small packing ones too so bear with me

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.219 
small packing ones too so bear with me
if<00:04:17.389> you<00:04:17.570> will<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.680> there<00:04:18.859> are<00:04:18.889> three<00:04:19.250> cards<00:04:19.669> and

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
if you will so there are three cards and

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.360 
if you will so there are three cards and
instead<00:04:21.229> of<00:04:21.380> having<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.739> do<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.130> same<00:04:22.370> thing

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
instead of having to do the same thing

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.310 
instead of having to do the same thing
what<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.090> velocity<00:04:24.330> things<00:04:24.780> are<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:24.960> wants

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
what this velocity things are just wants

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.600 
what this velocity things are just wants
to<00:04:25.440> double<00:04:25.949> left<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.449> a<00:04:27.479> double<00:04:27.930> lift

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
to double left so that is a double lift

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.950 
to double left so that is a double lift
when<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.639> have<00:04:29.820> three<00:04:30.120> cards<00:04:30.479> and<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:30.780> works

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
when I have three cards and it works

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.500 
when I have three cards and it works
really<00:04:31.169> well<00:04:31.639> where<00:04:32.639> if<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:32.910> hold<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> card

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
really well where if you hold the card

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.719 
really well where if you hold the card
like<00:04:33.690> you're<00:04:33.870> going<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.110> deal<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:35.310> your<00:04:35.520> left

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
like you're going to deal with your left

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.270 
like you're going to deal with your left
thumb<00:04:36.270> put<00:04:36.810> some<00:04:37.020> pressure<00:04:37.260> on<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:38.010> bottle

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
thumb put some pressure on the bottle

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.210

cart<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.639> push<00:04:39.000> over<00:04:39.800> what<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.949> will<00:04:41.070> do<00:04:41.190> is

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
cart and push over what that will do is

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.530 
cart and push over what that will do is
when<00:04:41.490> your<00:04:41.610> co<00:04:41.729> pressure<00:04:42.000> it<00:04:42.180> leaves<00:04:42.330> the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
when your co pressure it leaves the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.850 
when your co pressure it leaves the
bottom<00:04:42.840> part<00:04:42.990> intact<00:04:43.380> but<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.740> pushes

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
bottom part intact but it pushes

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.030 
bottom part intact but it pushes
everything<00:04:44.340> else<00:04:44.930> right<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.680> actually
