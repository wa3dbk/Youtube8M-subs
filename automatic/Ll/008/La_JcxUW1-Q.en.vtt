 welcome well found in ours 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.179
 corner dedicated to creativity here has 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.490
 told between us with a special guest the 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.140
 dear friend martina I live by hello martina 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.810
 what you show us in this beautiful 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.490
 episode dedicated to country painting 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.189
 in this episode I brought you this 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.880
 kitten that a placeholder 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.830
 napkin ring can also be a 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.510
 placeholder to tie a glass that 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.400
 may be useful for our tables 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.370
 of the holidays is yes we are under christmas 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.450
 so let's start thinking about decorating 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.610
 our table 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.030
 this is the design we will use that 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.520
 this kitten needs to copy the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.470
 paper pattern this is your design 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.670
 true martina exactly they are all mine 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.280
 inclinations this will have reported please 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.170
 then we lose this design there 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.760
 we lay on or a tracing paper or 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.350
 a tissue paper that can be 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 a great alternative and with a 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.340
 felt tip pen 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.870
 we transfer all the drawing so it goes 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.269
 traced a belice 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.820
 but recalculated perfect refill work 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.670
 that she actually did perfect 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.730
 we will have club design and now with this 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.190
 design we will draw our silhouette are 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.830
 a piece of plywood I thought 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.260
 perfect goes well not offset by 4 mm 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.360
 because so light and manageable 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.040
 we will use graphite paper or in 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.440
 alternative we can achieve one 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.530
 graphite paper using a pencil 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.500
 soft a 5b a seat on a simple 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.159
 sheet of paper which we will then place 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.200
 behind our our design it 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.800
 we will stop a little piece of Scotch and then 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.450
 we will transfer it with the graver I help you to 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.220
 keep it a little firm now do n't 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.320
 I'll move because I've already perfect it 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 you've already done it, I'm saying, see i 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.740
 various steps c then we will cut this 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.810
 our design we will have this ours 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.330
 drawing with with the jigsaw 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 table that would be the best thing 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.590
 or even with a hacksaw 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.570
 by hand or perfect, but perfect 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 a very feasible thing ok it is not 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.869
 complicated 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.509
 once we've cropped it up 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.849
 will present so perfect with a card 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.650
 stained glass window we will give a tnas un 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.780
 ebook on the edges to make it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.019
 we say we will take away all the harshness of the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.450
 wood is once this shape is finished 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.630
 we will also do the buu two little holes certainly there 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.380
 will be used to put from the bow 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.850
 with the primer here it is the first ritu 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:35.080
 lara and with a brush we will spread one 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.370
 or more hands of product product 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.530
 if the preparation of the fund is always 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.260
 very important from these small 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.130
 decorations exactly also because in 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.989
 this way once dried we could 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.750
 le di carlo and make it like this 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.730
 smooth surface very suitable for 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.530
 create those typical nuances of 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.330
 country painting very well then 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.049
 we will let it dry we give one or two 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.980
 murderous hands to logically fans 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.959
 to worry about the times there are no e 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.480
 we will find this little creature like this 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.940
 all white perfect where I saw 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.310
 that you have already reviewed how the mass 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.049
 first with the graphite paper the details 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.549
 from mind we will report the reason for echo 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.650
 whose paper must be transparent 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.320
 why concert and repositioning e 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.660
 much more facilitated we will put back 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.810
 above we will return the letter below 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.549
 graphite jacket that this thinks again and 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.049
 we will give all the design avoiding in 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.660
 particular that will come later 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.310
 recognized on the second floor and now Fetto 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.190
 we start to color now knows start 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.260
 to color that the most beautiful part 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.910
 then I usually use a brush 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.310
 dish however could use make up 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.700
 the cat's tongue than the fountain 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.120
 perfect 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.620
 now we will apply the acrylic colors 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.250
 very well spreading the backgrounds of 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.980
 flat color let's say and info basic wallpapers 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.590
 so-called bard wallpapers and then it's from 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.210
 usually one or more is applied 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.910
 hands this also depends on the color from 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.290
 how much the pigment is certain and consistent 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.910
 how strong the cover is 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.490
 the important thing is that it is covered 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.770
 perfectly we apply first 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.380
 all the basic shade then first 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.450
 we will put the brown now let's leave 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.940
 dry and you must sand that has 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.859
 a color the alt I have a correspondence though 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.600
 if anyone has a hand that much 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.790
 heavy that creates all those 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.680
 small strips say it would be out 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.300
 better give us a Senate card 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.910
 I know you've already prepared certain 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.270
 various steps then I come to you and ages 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.040
 also to let it dry properly 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.650
 here you have already put the dark brown then 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.910
 light brown and white on the wings 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.530
 on the light of our garden 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.240
 exactly zampatti nor a little bit more 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.560
 had already opened different i 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.330
 details of the hat and the 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.040
 white star perfectly 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.500
 exactly the ship then painted it 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.540
 in this case of affection silver 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.250
 I know that the peculiarity of painting 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.740
 country is that after doing one 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.630
 painting a color so flat yes 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.030
 they must do the most important thing they are 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.570
 the nuances I called you for this 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.430
 Neighborhood 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.680
 teach us how to do the nuances I have 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.470
 prepared by a kitten that as you see has 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.600
 already the shades almost all made and 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.880
 exceptions of the smooth that thinks the 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.660
 engine or how you do it then you take a 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.390
 small glass of water 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.400
 and fits into some go 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.380
 china of this retarding medium that 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.360
 it humiliates us to make the color 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.180
 don't dry immediately ok e 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.480
 then a brush is used 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.510
 corner that must be dipped unloaded a 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.010
 perfect bit is used so that 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.470
 don't get dirty ie I usually do 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.270
 I rotate perfect, I download some more 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.870
 to be sure that all is well that 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:49.160
 let's make the nuance very well e 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.650
 so proceed so let me see again 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.740
 this particular then washes the 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.930
 brush the brush must always be 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.990
 he pretends to be the rage brush and ours 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.670
 it is a podium water plus medium late 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.260
 turn the brush I usually turn it 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.760
 to be sure that you don't dirty it 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.130
 everything for you has color must remain 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:12.530
 only on the tip of the sisca brush 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:16.010
 recharge a little ok and then starting by hand 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.710
 firm hand still use the brush 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.540
 usually going back and forth 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.630
 yes therefore even if it holds a line 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.250
 quite wide with the second pass 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.050
 the more you move the color because there is the 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.820
 better a just retiring martina who 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.680
 it always costs more towards the tip to 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.320
 more steps with the brush more color yes 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.290
 perfect shift this is the result 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.840
 that you will get when our work is 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.360
 logically finished then i 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.150
 mustache with permanent marker 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.190
 are reported again and circulars and 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.570
 resumed the small line panels also a 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.880
 thin brush that stood for i 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.220
 common details with the marker 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.260
 perfect martina i look thank you 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.750
 so much of this teaching that there 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.990
 he made ours 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.780
 of your technique of this technique 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:04.900
 logically biomedical however we can 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.990
 find all the explanations and the card 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.810
 of your presentation on the website www 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.210
 the awning point com where people are 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.150
 will be able to contact and recover the 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.980
 peeled see his beautiful works 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:22.510
 I thank you so much this is it 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.490
 a nice and nice idea for the table 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:28.510
 for the festivities for the decorations there upstream 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:31.180
 of the variants certainly here they are with various 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.320
 kittens and then with a nice writing with 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.140
 the name of the people 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.300
 martina I thank you so much vi

 I'm always waiting for an upcoming episode 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.040
 full of novelty and curiosity is great 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.490
 lots of creativity thanks goodbye to 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.490
 all bye
