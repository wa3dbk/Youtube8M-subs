00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.180
 Hello everyone, Goodman 64 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.220
 and today I want to talk to you about 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.110
 what makes our wonderful 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.570
 victories epic Nagu in battles here in advance 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.050
 I would like to apologize for the dead graphics 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.720
 With the arrival of a new patch, I sank 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.090
 fps and had to sacrifice something to 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.570
 Sorry here I will soon decide this 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.980
 problem in the meantime here so unfortunately 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.910
 Again, I repeat again and so 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.980
 from what actually 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 all our great achievements 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.570
 which you all so admire in 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.940
 Internet and so on, of course, this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.399
 There must be a certain skill of the player 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.180
 who in general plays the tank otherwise 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.149
 simply 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.309
 Well, nothing will happen even if the stars 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.739
 will converge in the right direction anyway 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.070
 you will not succeed here that is 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.899
 skill is the main course and here and in 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.149
 In general , in general, there is nothing to discuss 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.080
 if hands grow out of ass so 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.500
 sorry 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.100
 you are unlikely to be lucky and you are hardly something 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.040
 be able to do you need to learn to play 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.440
 here is but practice has shown even the most 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.110
 skill players very often but 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.150
 unlucky them something well, just either 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.250
 team or stars so do not converge 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.980
 or shells are flying here from black and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.130
 Here, for example, I want to show this fight 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.480
 how lucky sometimes is how are you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 I could just notice right away 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.030
 the beginning of the battle made out of a 8 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.880
 vanshotom knocking him ammunition and towers 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.640
 abs body to heaven and now it has become 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 another satellite of our planet 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.120
 that's what I would like to note in this 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.910
 there will still be some moments in battle 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.640
 but just other than luck called 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.030
 probably it will not work and this is the second 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.250
 factor which is definitely very important 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920
 but the same wbi can call it as 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.520
 anything but luck 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.640
 but so lucky you are not allowed 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.620
 hit you you are styling or you hit you 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.049
 styling or you at the right moment 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.269
 hit someone in the caterpillar set 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.010
 tank exactly the shell came from 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.260
 artillery and everything in that spirit 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.409
 that is, from such trifles here very often 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.480
 success in battle 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:42.310
 well and of course far from unimportant 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.159
 is the work team 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.159
 as yours and the opposing team if 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.069
 in your team everything is going well 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.709
 if your teammates acts 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.829
 right that is don't climb there dying there 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.230
 somewhere in general it is not clear why 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.930
 all you will have a great victory for you 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.359
 provided if your teammates 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.400
 climb on the rampage tom me of course you can 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.680
 try to stop them but usually such 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.299
 people cannot be stopped by anything 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.010
 firmly confident in their cause and 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.890
 go to the hangar earlier than you 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.549
 have time to write your message here 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.319
 so of course the secret of victory is still 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.190
 is to play in platoon 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.180
 if you have but if it is good I 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.840
 I emphasize this is very important because 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 play three people who can't 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.000
 play and if you find yourself in the top 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.799
 team then you are more likely a burden for the team 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.220
 you will most likely become the cause 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.050
 hitting the gate if you are all together 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.680
 so difficult 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.840
 Well done guys, of course 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.820
 everything will be fine and you will bend 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.040
 convince here again the lucky moment 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.110
 110 e3 just missed me though he 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.020
 could plant me very well and very 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.480
 it hurts, I would be very upset but 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.830
 it did not happen it is very nice 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.400
 again the element of luck is that who 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.600
 never spoke only at the expense of his 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.060
 hands you can't pull a fight whatever 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.750
 you were not always skill always 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.910
 is always 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.740
 this element of luck should 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.300
 he must always be present 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.840
 I really don't really like it 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.160
 I couldn't bear my time 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:39.850
 to digest the 110th 310 and 4 in general 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.120
 after the patch after the nerf for a long 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.850
 I decided all the time 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 buy yourself this thing and but surprise for 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.980
 discovered herself that she has now become quite 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.850
 not bad and very interesting though of course 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.850
 scatter did not eat just terrible on my 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.160
 a glance could be smaller here but 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.940
 this fight to my surprise I have never 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:08.980
 missed and this is also the same element 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:13.150
 luck that I talked so much to 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.940
 This I have been talking about this for a long time 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.850
 Well that is said here is the type of Th dude 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.160
 don't drag in a fight there how can you 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.669
 Here I was in battle as an extra but in general 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.460
 stat purple Pauline measure and then a bang 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.160
 he merged started the fight well guys influence and in 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.530
 than where 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.520
 it happens that someone is lucky and someone 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.010
 no you drank and suddenly covered you 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.140
 Art and not even covered struck and all 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.780
 full houses cavalli lurks in the hangar and you do not 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.240
 from the fact that you are a bad player without that 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.480
 well the stars so agreed though of course 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.100
 in such situations it is very often 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.220
 players are guilty because they are 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:55.370
 Substitute for example now I am very 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.670
 Risk of course around feshshki spinning 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.800
 our tanks but about slightly sprained 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.600
 your ass and was not punished 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.850
 although the towers could take me here 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.820
 such a fight turned out so chaotic 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.550
 I have a story but I hope at least something was 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.310
 In this story interesting to do 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.510
 here and probably go to the results 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.970
 I got this fight wizard I got 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.740
 medals and support and main gauge 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.590
 played by the way speak without premium 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.660
 account forgot to pay it here 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.730
 that's why I didn't get as much as 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:37.760
 I would like to but as you can see 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.760
 10 out of 10 hits and 10 and medium 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.230
 penetration of 8 thousand damage is very good 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.510
 the result I would not say something 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.030
 some fantastic numbers 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.800
 fiercely proud and says no one else 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.560
 can not there of course it is not the most 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:57.320
 great performance on this tank but in 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:59.510
 In general, they are very good, I hope 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.120
 you liked the video I hope you have something 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:06.540
 for themselves may be learned 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.449
 But in general, that's all thanks to all 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.840
