big of a hassle for me I still do play

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.680 
big of a hassle for me I still do play
solo<00:04:18.390> occasionally<00:04:19.390> such<00:04:20.380> as<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.739> game<00:04:21.690> but

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
solo occasionally such as this game but

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.740 
solo occasionally such as this game but
that's<00:04:23.500> when<00:04:23.890> I

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
that's when I

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.750 
that's when I
find<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.290> kind<00:04:25.920> of<00:04:26.040> don't<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.580> game

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
find that I kind of don't like the game

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.240 
find that I kind of don't like the game
of<00:04:26.790> most<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.720> that's<00:04:28.470> my<00:04:28.650> one<00:04:28.830> recommendation

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
of most so that's my one recommendation

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.170 
of most so that's my one recommendation
that<00:04:30.150> could<00:04:30.330> say<00:04:30.570> is<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.370> get<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.000> little

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
that could say is if you do get a little

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.620 
that could say is if you do get a little
frustrated<00:04:33.740> get<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:34.980> party<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:36.330> mess
