00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
this whip wet mixture here so let's

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.980 
this whip wet mixture here so let's
start<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:32.790> 1/2<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.370> gonna<00:02:35.459> pull

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.560 

as<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:39.430> fold<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.880> you'll<00:02:40.000> seem<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.270> get<00:02:40.360> more

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
as you fold in you'll seem to get more

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.940 
as you fold in you'll seem to get more
and<00:02:40.630> more<00:02:40.750> coarse<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.380> that's<00:02:41.500> exactly<00:02:41.680> what

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and more coarse and that's exactly what

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.110 
and more coarse and that's exactly what
you<00:02:42.040> want<00:02:42.190> because<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.370> know<00:02:42.550> we're<00:02:43.000> trying

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you want because you know we're trying

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.640 
you want because you know we're trying
to<00:02:43.270> do<00:02:43.360> cookie<00:02:43.630> dough<00:02:43.780> yet<00:02:43.990> not<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> cake<00:02:44.470> batter

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
to do cookie dough yet not a cake batter

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.650 
to do cookie dough yet not a cake batter
once<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.580> well<00:02:45.760> incorporated<00:02:45.880> we're<00:02:46.600> now

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
once it's well incorporated we're now

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.220 
once it's well incorporated we're now
adding<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.230> second<00:02:47.770> batch<00:02:48.810> straight<00:02:49.810> in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.270 

there<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:53.770> just<00:02:53.830> like<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.040> nice

there we have it it's just like a nice
cookie<00:02:54.670> better<00:02:55.650> it'll<00:02:56.650> get<00:02:56.800> harder<00:02:57.130> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
cookie better it'll get harder and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.650 
cookie better it'll get harder and
harder<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.550> fold<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.030> means<00:02:58.330> it's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
harder to fold and that means it's

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.270 
harder to fold and that means it's
basically<00:02:59.080> ready<00:02:59.350> now<00:02:59.830> if<00:02:59.920> you're<00:03:00.040> not<00:03:00.130> gonna
