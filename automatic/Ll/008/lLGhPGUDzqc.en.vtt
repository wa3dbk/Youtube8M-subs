takes two or three but as you see here

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.590 
takes two or three but as you see here
you<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:06.030> through<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.360> again

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you go through it again

people<00:03:26.069> are<00:03:26.190> trying<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.459> find<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:28.220> it's

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
people are trying to find it it's

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.070 
people are trying to find it it's
amazing

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
amazing

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.820 
amazing
you<00:03:31.440> can't<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:31.769> into<00:03:31.920> buildings<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:34.470> controls

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
you can't go into buildings the controls

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.060 
you can't go into buildings the controls
are<00:03:35.100> pretty<00:03:35.540> basic<00:03:36.540> you'll<00:03:37.140> get<00:03:37.410> them<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:37.890> you

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
are pretty basic you'll get them if you

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.650 
are pretty basic you'll get them if you
just<00:03:38.250> don't<00:03:38.519> touch<00:03:38.700> anything<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.300> float

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
just don't touch anything you just float

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.229 
just don't touch anything you just float
in<00:03:39.750> space<00:03:40.310> left<00:03:41.310> bumper<00:03:41.489> steel<00:03:41.850> down<00:03:42.030> right

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
in space left bumper steel down right

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.759 
in space left bumper steel down right
bumpers<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:42.989> that's<00:03:43.140> pretty<00:03:43.290> much<00:03:43.530> it

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
bumpers to go up that's pretty much it

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.720 
bumpers to go up that's pretty much it
and<00:03:44.150> left<00:03:45.150> trigger<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.750> boost<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:49.250> as<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
and left trigger is to boost so as a

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.100 
and left trigger is to boost so as a
long<00:03:51.530> all<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.480> yeah<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:54.660> I'm<00:03:54.750> trying<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:54.989> say

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
long all so yeah what I'm trying to say

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
long all so yeah what I'm trying to say
here<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:56.340> also<00:03:56.519> get<00:03:56.880> into<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> phantom

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
here you can also get into a phantom

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
here you can also get into a phantom
using<00:03:59.130> pretty<00:03:59.340> much<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.610> same<00:03:59.760> technique

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
using pretty much the same technique

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.509 
using pretty much the same technique
which<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.510> want<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.720> do<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:01.920> usually<00:04:02.190> do

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
which you want to do what I usually do

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.870 
which you want to do what I usually do
is<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:03.680> little<00:04:04.680> like<00:04:04.920> subway<00:04:05.370> thing<00:04:05.610> that's

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
is a little like subway thing that's

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.479 
is a little like subway thing that's
running<00:04:06.060> through<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.049> center<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:08.100> new

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
running through the center of new

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.770 
running through the center of new
Alexandria<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.450> usually<00:04:10.380> follow<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:11.630> until<00:04:12.630> you

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
Alexandria I usually follow it until you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.819 
Alexandria I usually follow it until you
get<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.320> one<00:04:13.590> building<00:04:14.100> east<00:04:14.579> of<00:04:15.560> east<00:04:16.560> of

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
get to this one building east of east of

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.500 
get to this one building east of east of
that<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.160> big<00:04:17.370> building<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.150> building

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
that one big building see this building

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.469 
that one big building see this building
attached<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.530> subway<00:04:20.310> thing<00:04:20.519> just<00:04:21.299> head

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
attached to the subway thing just head

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.090 
attached to the subway thing just head
over<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:24.320> this<00:04:25.320> next<00:04:25.590> part<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:26.070> be

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
over to that this next part can be

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.550 
over to that this next part can be
tricky<00:04:26.550> if<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:26.910> want<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.180> get<00:04:27.330> phantom<00:04:28.169> then

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
tricky if you want to get phantom then

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.279 
tricky if you want to get phantom then
what<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.860> want<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.100> do<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:30.600> want<00:04:30.960> to

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
what you want to do is you want to

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.400 
what you want to do is you want to
hijack<00:04:32.039> a<00:04:32.580> Banshee<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:33.660> go<00:04:33.960> through<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.260> hoop

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
hijack a Banshee and go through the hoop

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.850 
hijack a Banshee and go through the hoop
again<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:36.180> can<00:04:36.479> be<00:04:36.600> tricky<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.990> get<00:04:37.830> a

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
to get a Banshee that's why I like to

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.980 
to get a Banshee that's why I like to
land<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.710> big<00:04:44.190> buildings<00:04:44.630> make<00:04:45.630> sure<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.200> uh

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
land on big buildings make sure that uh

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.450 
land on big buildings make sure that uh
some<00:04:48.990> banshees<00:04:49.440> can<00:04:49.590> see<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.919> don't<00:04:50.160> just<00:04:50.310> go

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
some banshees can see you don't just go

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.820 
some banshees can see you don't just go
here<00:04:50.780> because<00:04:51.780> as<00:04:52.050> soon<00:04:52.260> as<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.470> jump<00:04:52.650> out<00:04:52.800> of

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
here because as soon as you jump out of

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.830 
here because as soon as you jump out of
the<00:04:53.039> soon<00:04:53.850> as<00:04:53.910> you<00:04:54.000> jump<00:04:54.120> out<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.450> Pelican

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
the soon as you jump out of the Pelican

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.590 
the soon as you jump out of the Pelican
then<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.080> automatically<00:04:55.500> disappears<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:57.450> you

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
then it automatically disappears so you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.840 
then it automatically disappears so you
see<00:04:57.750> here<00:04:57.930> there's<00:04:58.169> three<00:04:58.770> or<00:04:58.950> four<00:04:58.979> banshees

a<00:06:15.920> bit<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.370> phantom<00:06:16.850> could<00:06:17.090> go<00:06:17.240> through

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
a bit a phantom could go through

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.700 
a bit a phantom could go through
