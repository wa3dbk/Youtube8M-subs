00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
part on top of the x 20 it's a very

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.760 
part on top of the x 20 it's a very
light<00:01:44.700> microphone<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.350> fuji

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
light microphone and because fuji

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.740 
light microphone and because fuji
include<00:01:47.159> extra<00:01:47.549> adapters<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> box<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
include extra adapters in the box you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.920 
include extra adapters in the box you
can<00:01:48.990> change<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> two<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> half<00:01:50.100> millimeter

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
can change the two and a half millimeter

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.380 
can change the two and a half millimeter
connector<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> st1<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> three<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
connector on the st1 to a three and a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
connector on the st1 to a three and a
half<00:01:54.540> millimeter<00:01:55.020> connector<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.490> gives

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
half millimeter connector and that gives

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.760 
half millimeter connector and that gives
you<00:01:56.850> some<00:01:57.030> extra<00:01:57.119> flexibility<00:01:57.930> maybe<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.619> can

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you some extra flexibility maybe you can

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
you some extra flexibility maybe you can
try<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.189> other<00:01:59.430> cameras<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.509> fuji<00:02:00.930> range
