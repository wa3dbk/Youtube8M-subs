00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 orange due to high 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.950
 temperatures 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.889
 There is you way to process glass 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.610
 modeling hood to watch in this 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.770
 moment and the second way uttered 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.320
 the difficulty of this method lies in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.080
 that master is utar and only two or three 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.150
 minutes to make a sculpture 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.550
 as due to a sharp drop 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.539
 temperatures and glass are very fast 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 cools down and loses elasticity want 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.660
 notice that until then there is no 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 school by taught during words brought 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.980
 Whether it is strictly inherited 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.050
 what man's line 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.539
 gradually the glass cools verde 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.539
 acquire macerate link 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.920
 notice the sculpture is practically 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.940
 ready glass literature at the moment 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.180
 about 700 degrees glass is considered 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.270
 cold for work but does not remain 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.940
 safe material for complete 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.159
 cooling glass sculptures remain on 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.159
 surface for another two and a half hours 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.670
 please horse rainbow so what 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.580
 put up the nuances whether there is a wife example 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.220
 leave on the surface like sculptures 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.950
 a glass or base for two to three minutes 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.100
 from the sharp temperature changes for 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 year no tolerate rhyme for glass 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 so for quenching if you went there 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.920
 by broadcasts 2 began to bake called 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920
