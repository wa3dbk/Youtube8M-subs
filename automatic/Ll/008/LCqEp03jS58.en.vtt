hundred times my one little criticism of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.150 
hundred times my one little criticism of
it<00:00:34.520> was<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:35.380> didn't<00:00:36.380> have<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.800> Marvel

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
it was it didn't have the Marvel

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.850 
it was it didn't have the Marvel
identity<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:37.970> like<00:00:38.120> it<00:00:38.240> was<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:38.450> so

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
identity to it like it was just so

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.470 
identity to it like it was just so
depressing<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.160> dark<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:40.640> grim<00:00:40.940> from<00:00:41.240> start

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
depressing and dark and grim from start

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.270 
depressing and dark and grim from start
to<00:00:41.540> finish<00:00:41.720> i<00:00:41.780> felt<00:00:41.960> like<00:00:42.020> if<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:43.010> go<00:00:43.130> back<00:00:43.220> and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
to finish i felt like if you go back and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.470 
to finish i felt like if you go back and
watch<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.640> original<00:00:43.730> when<00:00:44.000> i<00:00:44.030> was<00:00:44.180> like<00:00:44.270> i

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
watch the original when i was like i

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.240 
watch the original when i was like i
could<00:00:45.020> have<00:00:45.110> done<00:00:45.140> with<00:00:45.380> a<00:00:45.410> little<00:00:45.950> bit<00:00:46.100> of

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
could have done with a little bit of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.300 
could have done with a little bit of
that<00:00:46.420> Marvel<00:00:47.420> personality<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.530> but<00:00:49.010> okay

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
that at least the trailer suggests that

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:05.800 
that at least the trailer suggests that
Tony<00:01:04.970> Stark<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.360> actually<00:01:05.660> in<00:01:05.780> that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
to that the Hulkbuster armor was

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.590 
to that the Hulkbuster armor was
actually<00:01:10.550> being<00:01:10.670> taken<00:01:10.940> over<00:01:10.970> by<00:01:11.120> Ultron<00:01:11.480> or

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
actually being taken over by Ultron or

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.180 
actually being taken over by Ultron or

completely<00:01:14.540> different<00:01:14.660> that<00:01:15.350> was

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
completely different that was

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.650 
completely different that was
interesting<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:16.460> once<00:01:16.670> again<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.330> second

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
interesting but once again it's a second

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.290 
interesting but once again it's a second
trailer<00:01:17.870> with<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.140> exact<00:01:18.680> same<00:01:19.300> completely

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
trailer with the exact same completely

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.940 
trailer with the exact same completely
bleak<00:01:20.990> that's<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.530> term<00:01:21.680> i'll<00:01:21.800> use

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
bleak that's the term i'll use

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.550 
bleak that's the term i'll use
completely<00:01:22.610> bleak<00:01:23.000> tone<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.660> sec<00:01:24.200> okay<00:01:24.440> was

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
completely bleak tone a sec okay was

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.960 
completely bleak tone a sec okay was
okay<00:01:25.130> without<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.490> first<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:25.910> the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
okay without the first one but the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.120 
okay without the first one but the
second<00:01:26.870> one<00:01:26.960> again<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.620> just<00:01:27.680> felt<00:01:27.980> like<00:01:28.010> a

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
second one again it just felt like a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.190 
second one again it just felt like a
carbon<00:01:28.400> copy<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.820> little<00:01:29.030> bit<00:01:29.120> but<00:01:29.870> it's<00:01:30.050> an

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
carbon copy a little bit but it's an

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.020 
carbon copy a little bit but it's an

I just hope they don't do with the first
Avengers<00:02:15.920> trailer<00:02:16.040> did<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.550> give<00:02:16.640> us<00:02:16.760> too

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
Avengers trailer did and give us too

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.550 
Avengers trailer did and give us too
many<00:02:17.270> start<00:02:17.660> spoiling<00:02:17.900> too<00:02:18.230> many<00:02:18.380> shots

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
many start spoiling too many shots

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.990 
many start spoiling too many shots
that's<00:02:18.770> what<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.920> guess<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.280> did<00:02:19.550> like<00:02:19.790> about

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
that's what I guess I did like about

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.450 
that's what I guess I did like about
this<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.960> there<00:02:21.380> wasn't<00:02:21.590> too<00:02:21.920> much<00:02:22.100> new

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
this is that there wasn't too much new

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.610 
this is that there wasn't too much new
stuff<00:02:22.490> maybe<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.450> more<00:02:23.660> trailer<00:02:24.140> give<00:02:24.530> me<00:02:24.590> a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
stuff maybe one more trailer give me a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.990 
stuff maybe one more trailer give me a
little<00:02:24.710> bit<00:02:24.830> more<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.100> story<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.760> think

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
little bit more the story that I think

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.610 
little bit more the story that I think
we're<00:02:26.120> getting<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.450> bleak<00:02:26.690> movie<00:02:27.110> anyway<00:02:27.470> we're

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
we're getting a bleak movie anyway we're

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.720 
we're getting a bleak movie anyway we're
going<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.800> have<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.100> humor<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.550> pops

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
going to have that humor that pops

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.890 
going to have that humor that pops
inches<00:02:29.180> from<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.420> nature<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.780> these

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
inches from the nature of these

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.390 
inches from the nature of these
characters<00:02:30.140> anyway<00:02:30.620> but<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.100> movie<00:02:31.370> is

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
characters anyway but this movie is

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.310 
characters anyway but this movie is
going<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.700> be<00:02:31.790> bleak<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.450> from<00:02:32.780> what<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.110> set
