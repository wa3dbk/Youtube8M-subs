00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:42.630 

well<00:05:34.770> that<00:05:35.770> was<00:05:35.920> kind<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.160> weird

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.150 

maybe<00:05:43.640> it's<00:05:43.820> not<00:05:44.000> up<00:05:44.180> yet<00:05:44.770> alright<00:05:45.770> well<00:05:45.980> we'll

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
maybe it's not up yet alright well we'll

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.740 
maybe it's not up yet alright well we'll
worry<00:05:46.400> about<00:05:46.460> it<00:05:46.640> later<00:05:46.760> because<00:05:47.420> i<00:05:47.450> went

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
worry about it later because i went

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.390 
worry about it later because i went
there<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:47.990> it<00:05:48.170> just<00:05:48.320> took<00:05:48.440> me<00:05:48.620> two<00:05:48.710> tops<00:05:48.950> calm

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
there and it just took me two tops calm

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.740 
there and it just took me two tops calm
so<00:05:49.820> i<00:05:51.370> guess<00:05:52.370> that's<00:05:52.640> a<00:05:52.760> nix<00:05:53.060> on<00:05:53.240> that<00:05:53.480> for<00:05:53.720> now

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
so i guess that's a nix on that for now

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.440 
so i guess that's a nix on that for now
i<00:05:54.110> remember<00:05:54.620> when<00:05:55.070> the<00:05:55.580> other<00:05:55.760> side<00:05:56.030> opened<00:05:56.360> up

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
i remember when the other side opened up

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.450 
i remember when the other side opened up
it<00:05:56.600> wasn't<00:05:56.750> live<00:05:57.050> for<00:05:57.350> a<00:05:57.380> while<00:05:57.620> so<00:05:58.010> that's

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
it wasn't live for a while so that's

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.430 
it wasn't live for a while so that's
probably<00:05:58.730> what's<00:05:59.030> going<00:05:59.210> on<00:05:59.420> here<00:05:59.690> so<00:06:00.170> i<00:06:00.200> am
