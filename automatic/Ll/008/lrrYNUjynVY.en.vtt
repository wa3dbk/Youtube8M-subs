00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
setup is meant to squeeze the most XP

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.970 
setup is meant to squeeze the most XP
possible<00:00:41.750> out<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.989> your<00:00:42.079> playtime<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:42.710> the

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
best way to do that is to rush around

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.569 
best way to do that is to rush around
and<00:00:44.510> get<00:00:44.600> as<00:00:44.719> many<00:00:45.019> kills<00:00:45.350> as<00:00:45.589> possible<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:46.489> the

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
best way to do that it's actually to

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.060 
best way to do that it's actually to
throw<00:00:47.899> on<00:00:48.019> an<00:00:48.140> SMG<00:00:48.469> so<00:00:48.649> that's<00:00:48.859> what<00:00:48.980> we're

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
throw on an SMG so that's what we're

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.919 
throw on an SMG so that's what we're
gonna<00:00:49.160> do<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.940> SMG<00:00:50.359> that<00:00:50.510> we<00:00:50.600> are<00:00:50.719> going

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
gonna do and the SMG that we are going

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.989 
gonna do and the SMG that we are going
to<00:00:50.989> use<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.530> asm1<00:00:52.039> Strider<00:00:52.519> now<00:00:52.910> the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
to use is the asm1 Strider now the

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:54.430 
to use is the asm1 Strider now the
reason<00:00:53.300> why<00:00:53.359> we<00:00:53.510> are<00:00:53.539> using<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.989> strata<00:00:54.230> is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
reason why we are using the strata is

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.319 
reason why we are using the strata is
because<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:54.920> one<00:00:55.159> it<00:00:55.429> is<00:00:55.579> really<00:00:55.850> easy<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.120> get

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
because of one it is really easy to get

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.970 
because of one it is really easy to get
compared<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.749> the<00:00:56.839> speakeasy<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.499> some<00:00:57.890> of

compared to the speakeasy and some of
the<00:00:58.070> other<00:00:58.249> elite<00:00:58.519> variants<00:00:58.999> and<00:00:59.089> -<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.629> has<00:00:59.780> +1

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
the other elite variants and - it has +1

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.200 
the other elite variants and - it has +1
damage<00:01:00.769> which<00:01:00.949> really<00:01:01.399> really<00:01:01.789> helps<00:01:02.059> out

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
damage which really really helps out

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.669 
damage which really really helps out
when<00:01:02.659> you're<00:01:02.749> getting<00:01:02.839> in<00:01:03.019> lots<00:01:03.199> of<00:01:03.289> gunfights

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
when you're getting in lots of gunfights

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.200 
when you're getting in lots of gunfights
