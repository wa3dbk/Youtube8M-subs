welcome<00:00:02.310> back<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.210> update<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:03.959> the

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
welcome back to the update on the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.770 
welcome back to the update on the
electrical<00:00:06.770> resistance<00:00:07.770> furnace<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:09.150> here

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
electrical resistance furnace so here

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.890 
electrical resistance furnace so here
we're<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.440> our<00:00:10.769> testbed<00:00:11.490> environment<00:00:12.030> where<00:00:12.870> I

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
we're in our testbed environment where I

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.839 
we're in our testbed environment where I
have<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> concrete<00:00:13.620> slab<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.370> this

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
have the concrete slab on which this

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.929 
have the concrete slab on which this
rests<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:16.220> see<00:00:17.220> here<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:18.300> are<00:00:18.510> consuming<00:00:19.939> 926

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
rests and see here we are consuming 926

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.730 
rests and see here we are consuming 926
watts<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:22.550> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:23.910> right<00:00:24.060> there

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
watts as you can see right there

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.179 
watts as you can see right there
so<00:00:25.740> actually<00:00:26.730> for<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.710> platform<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.010> melt

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so actually for a platform that can melt

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.870 
so actually for a platform that can melt
aluminum<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:30.269> exceedingly<00:00:30.960> efficient

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
aluminum that's exceedingly efficient

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
aluminum that's exceedingly efficient
well<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.300> efficient<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:34.020> inductance

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
well not as efficient as an inductance

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.459 
well not as efficient as an inductance
furnace<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:37.250> resistance<00:00:38.250> furnaces<00:00:38.760> go

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
furnace but as resistance furnaces go

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.240 
furnace but as resistance furnaces go
very<00:00:40.469> efficient<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
very efficient so this is just a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.540 
very efficient so this is just a
aluminum<00:00:44.250> sheet<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> top<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.570> the

kind of heat can be contained within
such<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:10.020> thin

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
such a thin

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.240 
such a thin
thermal<00:02:11.400> barrier<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.360> amazing<00:02:13.250> so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
thermal barrier it's just amazing so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.800 
thermal barrier it's just amazing so
let's<00:02:14.490> place<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.330> back<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.850> always<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
let's place this back I always like to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.559 
let's place this back I always like to
keep<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.890> tops<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.370> furnaces<00:02:20.819> covered<00:02:21.270> just

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
keep the tops of furnaces covered just

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.460 
keep the tops of furnaces covered just
in<00:02:21.870> case<00:02:22.760> okay<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.810> I'm<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.319> shut

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
in case okay so I'm just going to shut

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.030 
in case okay so I'm just going to shut
this<00:02:25.650> off<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:28.370> there<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.520> go<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.770> show

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
this off and there we go just to show

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.290 
this off and there we go just to show
that<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.640> indeed<00:02:35.690> consuming<00:02:36.690> no<00:02:37.050> power<00:02:38.300> and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
that it is indeed consuming no power and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.900 
that it is indeed consuming no power and
yet<00:02:39.630> still<00:02:40.290> storing<00:02:43.489> massive<00:02:44.489> amounts<00:02:44.850> of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
yet still storing massive amounts of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.850 
yet still storing massive amounts of
infrared<00:02:45.270> that's<00:02:46.110> what<00:02:46.260> no<00:02:46.410> electricity

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
infrared that's what no electricity

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.600 
infrared that's what no electricity
applied<00:02:47.870> completely<00:02:48.870> completely

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
applied completely completely

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.770 
applied completely completely
electrically<00:02:50.610> cold<00:02:51.769> thermally<00:02:52.769> ablaze<00:02:53.780> so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
electrically cold thermally ablaze so

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.610 
electrically cold thermally ablaze so
you<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.560> starting<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.970> dull<00:02:57.620> really

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
you can see it's starting to dull really

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.990 
you can see it's starting to dull really
really<00:02:59.040> really<00:02:59.459> cool<00:03:00.140> very<00:03:01.140> very<00:03:01.440> nice<00:03:02.000> just

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
really really cool very very nice just

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.199 
really really cool very very nice just
going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> let<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.450> slowly<00:03:03.959> cool<00:03:04.380> down<00:03:05.209> there

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
going to let it slowly cool down there

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.460 
going to let it slowly cool down there
we<00:03:06.420> go<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:08.269> yeah<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.600> there's<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.260> an

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
we go so yeah if there's going to be an

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.770 
we go so yeah if there's going to be an
update<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.070> probably<00:03:11.970> it'll<00:03:12.300> be<00:03:12.480> an

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
update to this probably it'll be an

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.870 
update to this probably it'll be an
update<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.709> regards<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.280> electrical

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
update in regards to electrical

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.990 
update in regards to electrical
connections<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.900> overall<00:03:16.799> polish<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.549> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
connections and a overall polish of the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.690 
connections and a overall polish of the
project<00:03:18.690> but<00:03:19.310> compared<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.489> roll

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
project but compared to this roll

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.319 
project but compared to this roll
furnace<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.780> is<00:03:21.959> completed<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.590> about<00:03:23.329> four

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
furnace this is completed in about four

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.930 
furnace this is completed in about four
hundred<00:03:24.480> percent<00:03:24.959> less<00:03:25.230> time<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> quarter

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
hundred percent less time so a quarter

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.819 
hundred percent less time so a quarter
of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.180> time<00:03:27.420> required<00:03:28.350> for<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.650> other

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
of the time required for the other

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.569 
of the time required for the other
furnace<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:30.390> am<00:03:30.570> just<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:32.010> blown<00:03:32.549> away

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
furnace and I am just I'm blown away

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.509 
furnace and I am just I'm blown away
from<00:03:33.360> now<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.930> going<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.110> be<00:03:34.519> electrical

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
from now on it's going to be electrical

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.910 
from now on it's going to be electrical
