00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.670 

the<00:00:04.310> main<00:00:04.580> problem<00:00:05.180> in<00:00:05.569> cultivation<00:00:06.170> of<00:00:06.410> fruit

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
the main problem in cultivation of fruit

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.410 
the main problem in cultivation of fruit
trees<00:00:06.800> are<00:00:07.570> long<00:00:08.570> juvenile<00:00:09.139> period<00:00:10.420> alternate

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
trees are long juvenile period alternate

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.130 
trees are long juvenile period alternate
or<00:00:11.830> poor<00:00:12.830> bearings<00:00:13.750> and<00:00:14.750> also<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.380> for<00:00:15.650> yield

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
or poor bearings and also the for yield

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.370 
or poor bearings and also the for yield
so<00:00:18.140> this<00:00:18.439> can<00:00:18.650> be<00:00:18.830> overcome<00:00:19.160> by<00:00:20.380> grafting

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
so this can be overcome by grafting

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.980 
so this can be overcome by grafting
techniques<00:00:21.800> grafting<00:00:22.760> is<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.359> process<00:00:23.840> of

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
techniques grafting is the process of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.790 
techniques grafting is the process of
inserting<00:00:24.970> one<00:00:25.970> portion<00:00:26.510> of<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.840> plant<00:00:27.170> upon

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
inserting one portion of the plant upon

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.000 
inserting one portion of the plant upon
another<00:00:28.359> in<00:00:29.359> such<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:29.660> way<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.650> union

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
another in such a way that the union

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.100 
another in such a way that the union
will<00:00:31.220> be<00:00:31.250> formed<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.330> combination<00:00:32.930> will

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
will be formed and the combination will

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.160 
will be formed and the combination will
continue<00:00:33.590> to<00:00:33.739> grow<00:00:33.980> as<00:00:34.220> your<00:00:34.430> plant

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
continue to grow as your plant

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.280 
continue to grow as your plant
so<00:00:36.170> there<00:00:36.350> are<00:00:36.380> different<00:00:36.829> types<00:00:37.010> of<00:00:37.160> grafting

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
so there are different types of grafting

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.200 
so there are different types of grafting

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
from selection of sign materials so you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.140 
from selection of sign materials so you
have<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> remove<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.020> side<00:01:07.020> branches<00:01:08.150> hande

for a year it's protein of the birds so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.740 
for a year it's protein of the birds so
you<00:03:11.310> have<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.579> cover<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:12.060> iron<00:03:12.299> material

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
you have to cover this iron material

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.809 
you have to cover this iron material
with<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.049> polythene<00:03:13.500> sleeve<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.159> you<00:03:14.220> have

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
to put them in the Miss chamber for 15

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.850 
to put them in the Miss chamber for 15
to<00:03:17.340> 20<00:03:17.370> days<00:03:17.790> till<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.620> skirt

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.430 

so<00:03:27.980> this<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:28.550> for<00:03:28.730> Miss<00:03:28.880> Champa<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:30.080> where<00:03:30.260> we

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
so this is for Miss Champa so where we

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.530 
so this is for Miss Champa so where we
have<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.710> keep<00:03:30.890> referred<00:03:31.310> material<00:03:31.790> till<00:03:32.360> this

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
have to keep referred material till this

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.860 
have to keep referred material till this
iron<00:03:32.780> metal<00:03:33.190> gets<00:03:34.190> loaded<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.480> we<00:03:41.630> have<00:03:41.750> to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
iron metal gets loaded so we have to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.010 
iron metal gets loaded so we have to
keep<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.230> graft<00:03:42.560> material<00:03:43.240> and<00:03:44.240> also<00:03:44.540> can

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
keep the graft material and also can

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.660 
keep the graft material and also can
observe<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:47.350> sprouted<00:03:48.350> cyan<00:03:48.770> materials<00:03:49.280> so

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
observe the sprouted cyan materials so

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.390 
observe the sprouted cyan materials so
this<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.120> ideal<00:03:50.390> stage<00:03:51.220> we<00:03:52.220> have<00:03:52.370> to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
this is the ideal stage we have to

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.360 
this is the ideal stage we have to
transfer<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.120> rough<00:03:53.540> material<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
transfer the rough material to the

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:17.260 
transfer the rough material to the
hardening<00:03:55.820> Champa

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.580 

normally<00:04:18.270> share<00:04:18.600> nets<00:04:18.930> are<00:04:19.110> used<00:04:19.320> for

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
normally share nets are used for

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:28.010 
normally share nets are used for
gardening<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.420> rough<00:04:21.420> material<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.870> these

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
gardening of the rough material so these

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.590 
gardening of the rough material so these
are<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.550> hardened<00:04:29.550> grafts<00:04:29.940> metal<00:04:30.270> which<00:04:30.480> are
