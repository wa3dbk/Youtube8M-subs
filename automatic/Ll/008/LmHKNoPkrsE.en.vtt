00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:11.120
 The test area is a terrain where you 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.610
 only a few on it can be where you all 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.580
 can test vehicles 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.350
 yes and can still use various weapons 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.360
 or try it out 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.690
 find it if he is in the battlelog 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.220
 then be on multiplayer at 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.890
 multiplayer up here the rider now 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.869
 click on play and then on the whole 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.090
 you will find different modes here 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.910
 also test site then play on now 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.110
 clicked then he starts that and her 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.150
 can still play a little tip 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.620
 Do you want to play commander and 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.090
 Can not find any local servers you can 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.920
 here also commander select then searches 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.199
 he'll get you a matching server and 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.360
 if that is not exactly a teacher's server 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.489
 whatever happens, it always comes 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.440
 well on without looking any further 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.680
 so i have to have it all already 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.680
 loaded 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:04.379
 As you can see all the flight 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.290
 vehicles and sporting copter 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 combat helicopter scout helicopter and the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.000
 whole planes at me have the whole 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.190
 Bode which is there at adi whole dwelling 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.670
 vehicles 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:20.630
 The terrain is of course very good 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.630
 to learn to fly or 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.860
 it needs to be so that they, however, 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.800
 Only use the things with the vehicles 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.360
 could you 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.830
 have unlocked 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.130
 Unfortunately this can not be checked anymore 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.159
 I unlocked everything yes 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.750
 but in any case supported thing 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.060
 if you change a vehicle volt up 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.680
 not somehow eggs and eggs 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.740
 change or something is very easy 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.960
 Made easy is indeed an embarrassment 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.909
 so funny word kill suicide 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.280
 in English and already could us 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.140
 next born and that god used 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.100
 has it in a few seconds again 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.100
 been added to it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.760
 will the flight 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.540
 Of course the whole ends with the whole 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.349
 Water here in Paris store 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.349
 about the trip 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.720
 You can also eschborn here at the clock 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:37.629
 I'll spawn now, too 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.579
 Do you have the complete weapons here? 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.959
 you can pick up in game so this 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.970
 pick up weapons that are mostly 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.170
 between overboard or somehow 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.239
 stronger than normal weapons can be 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.909
 but not be selected and that 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.099
 you then somehow find on the map 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.480
 and pick up and have none 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.560
 ammunition can not go to vienna 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.000
 be found back such example 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.220
 The grenade launcher have this sometimes 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.319
 Here we have this monster 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.410
 rocket launcher that's so many 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.690
 champion who can lure everything 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:17.510
 missiles simultaneously shoot again 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:24.960
 short women shoot then we have here 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:26.570
 the grenade launcher environment goes too 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.010
 with very good 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.060
 the usa then also show that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.810
 the other sentences we have to 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.810
 for example the children 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.200
 then we have the whole snipers 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:49.970
 you do not know or you have to exist 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:52.490
 two four six different types so 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:04:12.530
 what you here, of course , on 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:13.840
 the most beautiful is what la la zb still 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.860
 interesting is 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.500
 I think they will come later 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.130
 again what she recently changed 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.810
 to have 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.690
 There was really only ammo box 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.250
 here as well as where to find the ammunition 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.700
 could charge and then you had 100 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.060
 shot this is somehow not 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.930
 more 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.110
 here you can definitely the class 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.670
 change but then I ask myself now 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.720
 how you can still load it 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.900
 you do not seem that way anymore 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.900
 right 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.760
 it is a feature or a bug that you can 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.730
 to load 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.480
 well refills have no ammunition which 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.400
 interesting is 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.230
 we can then also different weapons 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.360
 you can also stop that we could 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.830
 already so playful if the above 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.780
 go on it then you can press the button 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.780
 then comes two tons forward 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.490
 otherwise everything is possible here 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.990
 what I unfortunately what I good 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.990
 would have found is when a 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.980
 had an ad 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.090
 How much is it going to hurt? 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.730
 something makes for example a tank 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.750
 the pgb shoots how much prinz holds what 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.610
 Unfortunately that does not exist 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.150
 well, I wish you much fun with 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.150
 the test area
