00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.250
 let's now look at the basic functions of q3 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.290
 we also start here with the thistle 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.240
 therefore from the ignition of the control unit 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.610
 keep the front button pressed 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.340
 until the control unit flashes blue in 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.920
 this case is already on to go to it 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.380
 turn off we hold down the same 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.890
 red flashing button 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 the control unit is already turned off is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.890
 easy 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.600
 let's see how another is connected 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:54.969
 central q3 another nacar centers 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:59.199
 from ours then we turn on ok 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:03.309
 once we switch on the control unit we keep 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.750
 pressed the full power button which 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.979
 you don't see that it is flashing red 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.440
 we do the same thing also on 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:16.060
 second control unit then we press ok e 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.189
 then we press the button again 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.189
 of ignition until red flashing 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.020
 let's wait a few seconds 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.120
 perfect as you have seen now 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.690
 ECUs have been recognized and yes 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.750
 are connected it denotes the flashing 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.920
 simultaneous control unit LEDs for 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.860
 go and activate the one that the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.750
 intercom mode on ours 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.360
 our control units once switched on 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.430
 device can also be exploited in 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.250
 this case the vocal activation therefore 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.040
 speak into the microphone or go to 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.600
 press the front button once 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.640
 which is always the saying button 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.040
 multifunction of this control unit e 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.140
 wait a few seconds where a beep 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.710
 will indicate the beginning of ours 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.710
 communication 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.510
 now let's see how it matches a 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.510
 mobile to our q3 then turn on 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:31.280
 perfect now let's press for about 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.840
 5 seconds the key more than in the part 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.150

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.150
 upper then press the plus button 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.610

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.860
 let's go to the bluetooth menu 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:55.280
 of our phone 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:59.620

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.620

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.400
 now we already have our control unit 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.400
 connected to the scalar to the mobile 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.110
