of fills that cross the bar line because

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.770 
of fills that cross the bar line because
the<00:04:19.239> rhythmic<00:04:19.720> pattern<00:04:20.169> is<00:04:20.349> in<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.609> 3/4<00:04:22.419> time

the rhythmic pattern is in a 3/4 time
signature<00:04:23.470> it<00:04:23.680> ends<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.909> third<00:04:25.210> beat<00:04:25.539> of<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
signature it ends on the third beat of a

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.460 
signature it ends on the third beat of a
4/4<00:04:26.800> measure<00:04:27.099> and<00:04:27.400> then<00:04:27.880> starts<00:04:28.599> again<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
4/4 measure and then starts again on the

4/4 measure and then starts again on the
fourth<00:04:29.770> beat<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.580> same<00:04:30.909> measure<00:04:31.240> well<00:04:31.840> it

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
fourth beat of that same measure well it

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.740 
fourth beat of that same measure well it
carries<00:04:32.680> over<00:04:32.919> into<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.880> next<00:04:34.090> measure

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
carries over into the next measure

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.800 
carries over into the next measure
therefore<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.770> crosses<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.789> bar<00:04:37.000> line<00:04:37.240> check

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
therefore it crosses the bar line check

00:04:37.810 --> 00:05:40.140 
therefore it crosses the bar line check
it<00:04:37.990> out<00:04:38.110> you'll<00:04:38.530> dig<00:04:38.770> it
