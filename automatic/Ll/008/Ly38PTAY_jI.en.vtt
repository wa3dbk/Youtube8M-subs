show a label of a B or C which means is
passing<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:15.550> I<00:01:15.760> think<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.270> would<00:01:16.510> definitely

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
passing so I think that would definitely

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.249 
passing so I think that would definitely
help<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:18.130> schools<00:01:18.400> in<00:01:18.550> Arizona<00:01:19.020> aims<00:01:20.020> scores

help the schools in Arizona aims scores

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.830 
help the schools in Arizona aims scores

limited number of items their diagnostic
value<00:01:28.030> is<00:01:28.659> pretty<00:01:28.930> limited<00:01:29.170> they<00:01:29.649> give<00:01:29.829> you<00:01:29.950> a

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
value is pretty limited they give you a

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.029

decent snapshot of large group of kids

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.850 
decent snapshot of large group of kids
and<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:34.000> gets<00:01:34.180> more<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.960> more<00:01:35.049> dicing<00:01:35.710> when

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
and it gets more and more dicing when

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.649 
and it gets more and more dicing when
you<00:01:35.950> get<00:01:36.100> down<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.549> individual<00:01:37.180> student

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
you get down to the individual student

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.770 
you get down to the individual student
level<00:01:37.719> because<00:01:38.289> of<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.500> number<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:38.920> items<00:01:39.100> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
level because of the number of items and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.069 
level because of the number of items and
the<00:01:40.780> fairly<00:01:41.380> small<00:01:42.130> administration<00:01:43.000> time<00:01:43.240> so

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
the fairly small administration time so

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.200 
the fairly small administration time so
aims<00:01:44.439> scores<00:01:44.710> tell<00:01:45.100> us<00:01:45.280> quite<00:01:45.579> a<00:01:45.609> bit<00:01:45.759> which

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
aims scores tell us quite a bit which

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.700 
aims scores tell us quite a bit which
kids<00:01:46.539> are<00:01:46.689> doing<00:01:46.930> better<00:01:47.079> in<00:01:47.320> school<00:01:47.350> and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
kids are doing better in school and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.279 
kids are doing better in school and
which<00:01:47.829> kids<00:01:48.100> aren't<00:01:48.460> doing<00:01:48.579> better<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:49.060> school

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
which kids aren't doing better in school

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.859 
which kids aren't doing better in school
it<00:01:50.289> doesn't<00:01:50.350> really<00:01:50.979> measure<00:01:51.369> sub<00:01:52.060> skills<00:01:52.479> in

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
it doesn't really measure sub skills in

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.539 
it doesn't really measure sub skills in
mathematics<00:01:53.590> reading<00:01:54.219> comprehension

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
mathematics reading comprehension

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.420 
mathematics reading comprehension
probably<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.659> pretty<00:01:55.960> good<00:01:56.170> measure

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
probably is a pretty good measure

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.800 
probably is a pretty good measure
science<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.579> social<00:01:57.759> studies<00:01:58.000> are<00:01:58.420> left<00:01:58.630> out

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
science and social studies are left out

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.340 
science and social studies are left out
completely<00:01:59.350> so<00:02:00.630> parents<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.990> community

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
completely so parents and community

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.529 
completely so parents and community
members<00:02:02.409> could<00:02:02.920> look<00:02:03.130> at<00:02:03.369> grades<00:02:03.820> once<00:02:04.210> again

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
members could look at grades once again

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.919 
members could look at grades once again
I'd<00:02:04.689> say<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.020> accomplishments<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.859> kids<00:02:06.929> some

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
I'd say the accomplishments of kids some

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.190 
I'd say the accomplishments of kids some
of<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.490> authentic<00:02:09.490> work<00:02:10.119> product<00:02:10.869> they

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
of the authentic work product they

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.390 
of the authentic work product they
produce<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:12.490> new<00:02:12.820> system<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.900> what

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
produce the new system is going to what

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.920 
produce the new system is going to what
many<00:02:15.400> parents<00:02:15.820> are<00:02:15.970> familiar<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.810> their

many parents are familiar with for their

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
but the new system doesn't use just the

improve<00:02:33.569> we're<00:02:33.900> using<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.319> growth<00:02:34.739> score<00:02:35.489> in

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
improve we're using a growth score in

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
improve we're using a growth score in
other<00:02:36.030> words<00:02:36.269> we<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.959> know<00:02:37.080> what<00:02:37.319> they

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
other words we have to know what they

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.440 
other words we have to know what they
did<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.830> previous<00:02:38.099> year<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.239> they

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
did the previous year and then what they

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.020 
did the previous year and then what they
did<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.709> current<00:02:41.069> year<00:02:41.129> in<00:02:41.430> school<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
did the the current year in school and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.240 
did the the current year in school and
so<00:02:42.720> what<00:02:42.989> percentage<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.800> students

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
so what percentage of the students

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.030 
so what percentage of the students
showed<00:02:44.760> growth<00:02:45.330> whether<00:02:45.989> it's<00:02:46.349> performing

is a fair passing score for a test but

on a really hard test the passing score

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.180

impact data based on profiles of scores
from<00:03:36.900> prior<00:03:37.200> years<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.709> do<00:03:38.519> believe<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.269> is

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
from prior years I do believe that it is

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.000 
from prior years I do believe that it is
important<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.900> show<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.290> progress<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.889> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
important to show the progress and the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.949 
important to show the progress and the
data<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.639> growth<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.329> school<00:03:42.750> has

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
data and the growth that the school has

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.199 
data and the growth that the school has
been<00:03:42.989> making<00:03:43.440> but<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.340> also<00:03:44.609> think<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:45.090> is

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
been making but I also think it is

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.420 
been making but I also think it is
critical<00:03:45.690> for<00:03:45.720> us<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.799> invite<00:03:47.099> them<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.400> come

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
critical for us to invite them to come

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.420 
critical for us to invite them to come
into<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.940> school<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.859> look<00:03:49.859> at<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.280> other

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
into the school and look at the other

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.460 
into the school and look at the other
wonderful<00:03:50.819> programs<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:51.599> have<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:52.200> on

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
wonderful programs that we have going on

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.170 
wonderful programs that we have going on
as<00:03:52.680> far<00:03:52.709> as<00:03:53.130> before<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.880> after-school

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
as far as before and after-school

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.440 
as far as before and after-school
programs<00:03:54.359> extend<00:03:55.290> their<00:03:55.440> learning<00:03:56.450> what

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
programs extend their learning what

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.690 
programs extend their learning what
exactly<00:03:58.230> happens<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.859> classrooms<00:03:59.430> as

engaged well my understanding of the two

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.289 
engaged well my understanding of the two
systems<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.109> last<00:04:10.889> year<00:04:11.250> or<00:04:11.459> before<00:04:12.150> this

new legislation the aims scores were

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.800 
new legislation the aims scores were
used<00:04:16.410> significantly<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.519> determining<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.450> a

used significantly in determining if a
school<00:04:19.019> district<00:04:19.560> was<00:04:19.799> exceeding<00:04:20.870> performing

what<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.200> understand<00:04:25.710> now<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.430> they're

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
what I understand now is that they're

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.370 
what I understand now is that they're
doing<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:27.030> new<00:04:27.180> system<00:04:27.599> which<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.050> going<00:04:28.260> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
doing a new system which is going to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.310 
doing a new system which is going to
give<00:04:28.530> my<00:04:29.160> school<00:04:29.580> district<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.240> grade<00:04:30.570> such<00:04:31.139> as

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
give my school district of grade such as

certainly we would hope that a name
score

a culmination of many months of

instruction certainly a name score is a
snapshot<00:04:48.509> in<00:04:48.809> time<00:04:48.959> it's<00:04:49.379> an<00:04:49.499> important

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
snapshot in time it's an important

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.059 
snapshot in time it's an important
snapshot<00:04:50.550> though<00:04:50.789> we<00:04:51.059> shouldn't<00:04:51.770> discount<00:04:52.770> it

snapshot though we shouldn't discount it
but<00:04:53.429> we<00:04:53.879> also<00:04:54.059> need<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.419> ensure<00:04:54.749> that<00:04:54.929> we're

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
but we also need to ensure that we're

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.049 
but we also need to ensure that we're
looking<00:04:55.499> at<00:04:55.649> many<00:04:55.830> things<00:04:55.919> in<00:04:56.399> addition<00:04:56.879> to

it's<00:05:00.659> one<00:05:01.020> way<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:02.009> look<00:05:02.159> at<00:05:02.689> school

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689 
it's one way to look at school

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.199 
it's one way to look at school
effectiveness<00:05:03.959> can<00:05:04.889> definitely<00:05:05.490> be<00:05:05.669> able<00:05:05.969> to

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:06.209 
effectiveness can definitely be able to

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.480 
effectiveness can definitely be able to
see<00:05:06.449> how<00:05:07.199> what<00:05:07.709> is<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:07.949> percentage<00:05:08.339> of

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
see how what is the percentage of

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.829 
see how what is the percentage of
students<00:05:08.819> who<00:05:08.879> are<00:05:09.059> continuing<00:05:09.539> to<00:05:09.569> progress

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:09.839 
students who are continuing to progress

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.850 
students who are continuing to progress
and<00:05:10.379> meet<00:05:11.249> or<00:05:11.550> exceed<00:05:11.580> on<00:05:11.999> the<00:05:12.149> aims<00:05:12.860> but

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
and meet or exceed on the aims but

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.899 
and meet or exceed on the aims but
there's<00:05:14.099> definitely<00:05:14.219> a<00:05:14.580> lot<00:05:14.729> of<00:05:14.879> different

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
there's definitely a lot of different

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.570 
there's definitely a lot of different
ways<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.509> look<00:05:15.959> at<00:05:16.289> a<00:05:16.349> school<00:05:17.339> and<00:05:17.429> its

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
ways to look at a school and its

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.869 
ways to look at a school and its
effectiveness<00:05:18.059> not<00:05:18.479> only<00:05:19.249> the<00:05:20.249> outcomes<00:05:20.699> of

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
effectiveness not only the outcomes of

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.439 
effectiveness not only the outcomes of
the<00:05:21.149> of<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.809> aims<00:05:22.369> but<00:05:23.369> also<00:05:23.610> what<00:05:24.179> is<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
the of the aims but also what is the

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.509 
the of the aims but also what is the
school<00:05:24.719> culture<00:05:25.019> like<00:05:25.349> what<00:05:26.129> is<00:05:26.219> the<00:05:26.369> mission

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:26.519 
school culture like what is the mission

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.070 
school culture like what is the mission
and<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:26.879> vision<00:05:26.909> of<00:05:27.209> the<00:05:27.269> school<00:05:27.659> what<00:05:27.839> is<00:05:27.929> the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
and the vision of the school what is the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.079 
and the vision of the school what is the
leadership<00:05:28.499> like<00:05:28.709> what<00:05:29.339> is<00:05:29.459> the<00:05:29.550> discipline

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
leadership like what is the discipline

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.809 
leadership like what is the discipline
data<00:05:30.300> show<00:05:31.169> for<00:05:31.529> the<00:05:31.649> school<00:05:32.009> what<00:05:32.639> are<00:05:32.729> the

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
data show for the school what are the

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.459 
data show for the school what are the
expectations<00:05:33.089> of<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.599> teacher<00:05:33.899> so<00:05:34.199> there's<00:05:34.379> a

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
expectations of the teacher so there's a

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.989 
expectations of the teacher so there's a
lot<00:05:34.649> of<00:05:34.679> different<00:05:34.769> ways<00:05:35.099> to<00:05:35.459> look<00:05:35.610> at<00:05:35.789> at

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:35.999 
lot of different ways to look at at

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.899 
lot of different ways to look at at
success<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.869> not<00:05:36.959> just<00:05:37.199> that<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:38.669> aims

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
success and not just that the aims

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.239 
success and not just that the aims
outcomes<00:05:39.479> but<00:05:39.719> it<00:05:39.929> is<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.259> good<00:05:40.649> way<00:05:40.860> for<00:05:40.889> us<00:05:41.219> to

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 
outcomes but it is a good way for us to

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.389 
outcomes but it is a good way for us to
see<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:42.419> teachers<00:05:43.199> on<00:05:43.349> track<00:05:43.649> in<00:05:43.949> teaching

we<00:05:57.930> know<00:05:58.050> it's<00:05:58.199> important<00:05:58.709> there's<00:05:59.610> also<00:05:59.849> some

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
we know it's important there's also some

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.449 
we know it's important there's also some
research<00:06:00.539> that<00:06:00.899> shows<00:06:01.169> the<00:06:01.740> connection<00:06:01.949> of

our communities and our families in
Arizona<00:06:05.039> has<00:06:05.969> been<00:06:06.449> struggling<00:06:07.169> over<00:06:07.289> the

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
Arizona has been struggling over the

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.699 
Arizona has been struggling over the
years<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.159> so<00:06:09.089> people<00:06:09.749> in<00:06:09.899> education<00:06:10.529> are

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:10.709 
years and so people in education are

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.089 
years and so people in education are
doing<00:06:11.689> lots<00:06:12.689> of<00:06:12.929> creative<00:06:13.199> things<00:06:13.589> to<00:06:13.829> try<00:06:14.039> to

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
doing lots of creative things to try to

engage families with their schools on
the<00:06:16.589> onset<00:06:17.219> I<00:06:17.429> would<00:06:17.639> sit<00:06:17.879> there<00:06:17.909> and<00:06:18.089> think

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
the onset I would sit there and think

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.419 
the onset I would sit there and think
that<00:06:18.539> if<00:06:18.659> my<00:06:18.869> child<00:06:19.169> school<00:06:19.679> doesn't<00:06:19.979> receive

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:20.429 
that if my child school doesn't receive

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:22.549 
that if my child school doesn't receive
a<00:06:20.459> high<00:06:20.699> grade<00:06:20.759> I<00:06:21.029> initially<00:06:21.959> have<00:06:22.139> concern

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:22.559 
a high grade I initially have concern

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:24.980 
a high grade I initially have concern
however<00:06:23.490> understanding<00:06:24.449> all<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:24.689> components

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
however understanding all the components

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.230 
however understanding all the components
that<00:06:25.259> go<00:06:25.349> into<00:06:25.499> a<00:06:25.800> good<00:06:26.039> school<00:06:26.159> system<00:06:26.339> I'll

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
that go into a good school system I'll

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.149 
that go into a good school system I'll
take<00:06:27.599> more<00:06:27.869> time<00:06:28.110> to<00:06:28.139> pay<00:06:28.439> attention<00:06:28.469> as<00:06:29.009> to
