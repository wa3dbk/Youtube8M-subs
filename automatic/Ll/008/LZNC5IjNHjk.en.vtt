00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
decided to do a video on survival tap I

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.030 
decided to do a video on survival tap I
don't<00:00:10.380> think<00:00:10.500> I've<00:00:10.590> done<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> those

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
don't think I've done one of those

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.169 
don't think I've done one of those
before<00:00:11.099> we've<00:00:11.519> been<00:00:11.639> selling<00:00:11.940> these<00:00:12.000> for

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
before we've been selling these for

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.839 
before we've been selling these for
years<00:00:12.679> over<00:00:13.679> ten<00:00:13.889> years<00:00:14.129> ago<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.339> think<00:00:14.459> it<00:00:14.700> was

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
years over ten years ago I think it was

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.940 
years over ten years ago I think it was
one<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.330> our<00:00:15.509> first<00:00:15.719> products<00:00:16.230> survival<00:00:16.740> tabs

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
one of our first products survival tabs

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.770 
one of our first products survival tabs
are<00:00:17.160> pretty<00:00:17.340> cool<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.300> move<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.510> bunch

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
are pretty cool and we do move a bunch

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.360 
are pretty cool and we do move a bunch
of<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.080> bunch<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.470> them<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.950> I'm<00:00:20.040> not<00:00:20.100> sure

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
of a bunch of them but I'm not sure

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.190 
of a bunch of them but I'm not sure
everyone<00:00:20.610> knows<00:00:20.940> really<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.870> they<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.050> I

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
everyone knows really what they are I

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.290 
everyone knows really what they are I
think<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.770> an<00:00:22.860> important<00:00:23.310> part<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.940> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
think it's an important part of a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.840 
think it's an important part of a
rounded<00:00:24.690> out<00:00:24.810> emergency<00:00:25.470> plan<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.700> also

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
rounded out emergency plan you can also

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.370 
rounded out emergency plan you can also
use<00:00:27.090> them<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.360> other<00:00:27.480> things<00:00:27.600> as<00:00:27.990> well<00:00:28.140> we'll

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
use them for other things as well we'll

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810 
use them for other things as well we'll
explain<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.860> in<00:00:28.950> a<00:00:28.980> minute<00:00:29.100> but<00:00:29.520> what<00:00:29.670> they

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
explain that in a minute but what they

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
explain that in a minute but what they
are<00:00:30.000> survival<00:00:30.510> tabs<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:32.870> they<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.260> they

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
are survival tabs is they they if they

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.260 
are survival tabs is they they if they
develop<00:00:34.710> them<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.310> space<00:00:35.520> program<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
develop them for the space program and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.000 
develop them for the space program and
there's<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:36.870> high<00:00:37.110> quality<00:00:37.170> protein

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
there's really high quality protein

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.640 
there's really high quality protein
other<00:00:38.220> things<00:00:38.580> that's<00:00:39.110> you<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.440> body

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
other things that's you know your body

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.410 
other things that's you know your body
retains<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> point<00:00:42.150> of<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
retains all of it is the point of it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.480 
retains all of it is the point of it
rather<00:00:42.930> than<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.650> most<00:00:43.920> food<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.310> body

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
rather than you know most food your body

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.310 
rather than you know most food your body
digests<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> gets<00:00:45.630> rid<00:00:45.900> of<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
digests some of it gets rid of it and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.260 
digests some of it gets rid of it and
it's<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.040> efficient<00:00:47.790> these<00:00:47.970> are<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's not very efficient these are just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's not very efficient these are just
very<00:00:48.329> efficient<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.470> twelve<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> day<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.100> 12<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
very efficient so twelve a day at 12 a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220 
very efficient so twelve a day at 12 a
day<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.790> these<00:00:50.970> will<00:00:51.329> apparently<00:00:51.840> keep<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
day of these will apparently keep you

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.110 
day of these will apparently keep you
alive<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.920> they<00:00:53.040> say<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.460> manufacturer

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
alive is what they say the manufacturer

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.290 
alive is what they say the manufacturer
who<00:00:54.720> developed<00:00:55.170> them<00:00:55.489> they're<00:00:56.489> very<00:00:56.670> cool<00:00:56.880> let

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
efficient to get the food into your your

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.780 
efficient to get the food into your your
your<00:02:48.580> system<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.720> survive<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:51.130> if<00:02:51.670> you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
your system so you survive and if you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.880 
your system so you survive and if you

other food even better that's why I'm
thinking<00:02:55.720> this<00:02:56.020> should<00:02:56.140> be<00:02:56.200> an<00:02:56.260> overall<00:02:56.530> part

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
thinking this should be an overall part

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.890 
thinking this should be an overall part
of<00:02:57.010> your<00:02:57.130> emergency<00:02:57.580> food<00:02:57.790> plan<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.570> if<00:02:58.750> you
