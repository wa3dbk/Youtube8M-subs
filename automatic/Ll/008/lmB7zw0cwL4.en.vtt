00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 ah 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.020
 ah 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.020
 and 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.040
 I the decision is going to be complicated came 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.470
 of a family empowered father 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.960
 architect on the other side of madrid 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 photographer flavored and said good 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.689
 do not be an architect because I am 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.689
 architect but I did not leave 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.510
 and 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.640
 when in the end I finish my career 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.300
 intensely doubling a master's degree in film 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.100
 a mixed dementia his house I decided to do 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.320
 the house before I left my mastery and 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.900
 I have to admit that that first house 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.130
 this first experience with ideas 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.110
 that poses is a seed the book 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.450
 it ends is walking the space that you 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.370
 you imagine the structure menu 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.370
 I fell in love and since then he would not let me 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:01:01.660
 an opportunity to get to know your 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.839
 grandfather intellectuality with him I learned 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.330
 much to this idea of him my creator that 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.390
 he spends all week watching and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.280
 opening books listening to music and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.740
 choosing the social group and people with 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.030
 the difficulty and talk and reflect and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.860
 all that simulation of what happens in 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.350
 the weeks it becomes after the end 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.759
 week too restored in four 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.850
 or five shots picture that 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.360
 will become revisited plastic be 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.360
 indicated 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.890
 of the architecture workshop is a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.010
 architectural office that leads as 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.120
 almost 20 years working I think I've 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.370
 gone through several moments but something that 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.950
 It characterizes at least for me as 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.400
 are your projects in which the connection 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.920
 between architecture project and place is 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.350
 extremely important at the level of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.200
 workshop philosophy this way of 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.660
 work to feed 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.430
 play with previous proportions 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.430
 the outside is part of all this 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.220
 the question of what is the most 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.980
 satisfactory that I have the works 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.290
 when I see how the sun and the shadow and the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.599
 light caress differently to the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 day pass side never stop 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.019
 to marvel at how the work is lived and 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.360
 It gets stronger as we understand 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:37.150
 the path of the sun from the east to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.150
 west in its different conditions 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.599
 I am currently a project manager in 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.549
 the projects that you enjoyed most or that 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.620
 the school has been more enriching 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.260
 of visual arts from Oaxaca faith all 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.420
 the theme of the place that already in water 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.150
 -this is a great place to make a 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.810
 project and then it was a very project 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.810
 enriching 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.110
 and when we realize how important 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.860
 people also in the form and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.340
 aesthetic and formal systems of 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.120
 solve but on how those new 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.750
 materials 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.519
 this new density of force of light 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.069
 of the sun depending on the place of 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.400
 land in which we love always 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.160
 different dramatic conditions new 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.769
 to generate new compositions a 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.090
 surprise in deep energy to follow 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.090
 doing new things
