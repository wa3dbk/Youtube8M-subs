because this um deck is pretty much
perfect<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:44.550> no<00:00:44.730> flaws<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.210> if

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
perfect like there's no flaws like if

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.299 
perfect like there's no flaws like if
you're<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.410> those<00:00:46.559> people<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.010> like

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
you're one of those people that like

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.310 
you're one of those people that like
just<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.000> find<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> littlest

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
just like to find like the littlest

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.189 
just like to find like the littlest
things<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> point<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> flaw

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
things and point out that it's a flaw

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.299 
things and point out that it's a flaw
and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.320> you'll<00:00:52.440> probably<00:00:52.649> find<00:00:52.949> something

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and then you'll probably find something

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
and then you'll probably find something
that's<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.789> does<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> affect<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that's like does it affect the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.959 
that's like does it affect the
performance<00:00:56.149> or<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> but

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
performance or like the look of it but

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
performance or like the look of it but
like<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.480> find<00:01:00.719> something<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.350> oh

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
like if you just find something like oh

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.670 
like if you just find something like oh
this<00:01:02.399> thing<00:01:02.699> isn't<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:04.110> color<00:01:04.409> isn't

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this thing isn't like the color isn't

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640 
this thing isn't like the color isn't
even<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.049> really<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.409> dumb

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
even then like that will really be dumb

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
even then like that will really be dumb
but<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.030> pretty<00:01:09.240> much<00:01:09.330> perfect<00:01:09.960> like

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
but it's like pretty much perfect like

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.060 
but it's like pretty much perfect like
the<00:01:10.350> shape<00:01:10.650> nice<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> defined<00:01:12.200> like<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.439> plan

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the shape nice and defined like a plan

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
the shape nice and defined like a plan
your<00:01:14.189> deck<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:14.400> thought<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.970> dips<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:15.840> really

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
your deck i thought the dips like really

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
your deck i thought the dips like really
define<00:01:16.500> what<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.580> kind<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.939> round

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
define what they like kind of like round

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.289 
define what they like kind of like round
like<00:01:18.630> berlin<00:01:19.020> would<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.619> theirs<00:01:19.950> are

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
like berlin would like theirs are

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.130 
like berlin would like theirs are
defined<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:21.810> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> like

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
defined but like they're kind of like

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.370 
defined but like they're kind of like
around<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.119> like

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
around but like this is just like

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
around but like this is just like
straight<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.850> flat<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.240> goes<00:01:27.479> straight

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
straight like flat and my goes straight

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.100 
straight like flat and my goes straight
up<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.220> define<00:01:29.900> concave<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
up it's just really define concave a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.609 
up it's just really define concave a
pretty<00:01:31.320> deep<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:33.630> can't<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
pretty deep but you can't we see it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
pretty deep but you can't we see it
because<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.040> extra<00:01:35.369> smooth<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.000> covering

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
because my extra smooth is like covering

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.770 
because my extra smooth is like covering
it<00:01:38.090> this<00:01:39.090> deck<00:01:39.509> has<00:01:39.720> amazing<00:01:40.290> pop<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.860> um
