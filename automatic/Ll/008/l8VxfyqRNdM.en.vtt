00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.670
 hello artist Oleg 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.500
 he zhilyaev today we work in watercolor 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 and I want to tell you how 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 working by the method of ola directly comply 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.280
 the sequence I'm on a wet sheet 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:40.290
 laying the sky and not letting the leaf 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.640
 dry laying foreground 2 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.800
 at peel on which will be located 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.210
 tree trunks 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.210
 how do you see that sky i laid 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.940
 with a little paint on the brush 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.600
 and the fore here are these hillock already 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 contain large amounts of paint 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 which allows you to mix right on 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.580
 a sheet of paper 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 imposing stains on the surface of the sheet and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.050
 the paint mixes freely among themselves 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.190
 already on the surface of the paper these are white 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.110
 stains 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:29.159
 lighted plots of land i do 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:32.330
 wash the brush in a jar of water and squeeze 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.330
 her hand 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.050
 thereby removing the excess from the sheet of paper 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.730
 while watercolor raw she allows 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.480
 correct 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:51.260
 as you can see on the raw sheet paint well 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.560
 spreads and creates imitation 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.820
 vegetation 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.600
 some grass I still want to say 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.810
 that in this piece we will try 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:07.619
 create create such an artistic 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.750
 work that will tell 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.510
 tell the viewer his story 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.800
 history I continue to work already under a little 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.840
 dried leaf 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:27.480
 it's still wet but not as wet as 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.709
 was at the very beginning the paint was already 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.709
 less spread this process 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.230
 slows down and now I can allow 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:44.430
 imagine working with the tree crown 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:49.170
 also applying thick watercolor masks 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.330
 letting the paint mix but no longer 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.910
 so clearly 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:59.720
 like a raw sheet i took a rough 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 bristle brush and create foliage texture 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.610
 breaking their masks and now complementing them 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:12.500
 in a different color that is, it is a shadow more 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.500
 the cold part of the tree crown 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.090
 and going back to our story one common 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:24.720
 clown and two trunks that drag each other 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.159
 11 to a friend we will write 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.030
 thinner and other thicker 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.510
 most likely in our work it will be 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.950
 symbolize 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.329
 male and female who like this 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.849
 from different hillocks 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:47.760
 are drawn to each other in this work you 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.700
 you can make sure that is very small 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.709
 watercolor work can talk 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.189
 with the viewer and telling your story 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:03.389
 but we will continue to work with the watercolor sheet 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:05.939
 more and more dries up and now i'm 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.680
 I can afford to draw trunks 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.269
 of trees 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.810
 note that the paint is already 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.229
 practically does not spread on the sheet but 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.380
 the sheet is still in the corners and wet and 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.049
 The principle of watercolor is preserved if 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.199
 work completely dry sheet large 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:28.289
 the amount of paint something watercolor 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:33.000
 turn into gouache will be opaque 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:38.310
 and not interesting work work spoiled 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.870
 dried out even more and I'm starting to 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:47.130
 they do not require much detail 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:49.889
 the amount of paint on the brush and these small 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.430
 details will not affect transparency 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.430
 watercolors 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.150
 here you see the sequence of work 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:08.610
 first we laid 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:12.030
 Wet leaves on the sky fish of grass 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.420
 and bushes and then already like 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.700
 snap we have more spelled over 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.900
 strict details more clear 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.390
 Here is a combination of prescribed and more 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.690
 blurry things too creates workers 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.200
 very interesting effect 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.920
 some spots of watercolor themselves 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.860
 tell us where you need it 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.160
 add a stone where you need to finish 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.890
 some branch 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:48.060
 here the work is done not from nature therefore 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:51.810
 our imagination is fully engaged but 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.370
 the birds in the background should 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.980
 emphasize the air with this work and 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.000
 aspiration of this pair to friend 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:08.120
 to a friend , you see that masculine 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.380
 very bent over getting to 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:17.760
 the other edge his roots were aha but all 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:21.540
 equal to the eternal pursuit of one half 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.750
 to the other will lead to such 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.750
 the results 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.310
 i earn small parts and 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.729
 practically finish my job you 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:39.909
 see as in one short session about 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:42.849
 20 minutes along with the drying of the leaf we 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.210
 created a talking picture which 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:48.129
 tells the viewer a story 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:53.729
 masculine and feminine 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.729
 who endlessly stretch into each other 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.510
 i am fine tuning it can 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:07.200
 take a lot of time as much as 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.540
 you will want but the main thing is not to write 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.110
 thank you for your attention 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:16.730
 I was interested to prepare for you 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.730
 this occupation
