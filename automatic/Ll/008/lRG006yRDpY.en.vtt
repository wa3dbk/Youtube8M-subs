00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 roger schmidt will be the career path of 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
 holger schmidt a bit something 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.910
 sketched in MÃ¼nster in Paderborn then 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830
 sALZBURG 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 He has always pulled his style through 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.610
 in salzburg has also at the beginning of his 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.850
 time had big problems with the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.260
 Implementation of this run-intensive offensive 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.150
 already aligned pressings in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.949
 the opponent half and the second 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 year he dominated the league bavaria in 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.060
 the preparation last winter three 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.699
 sent to zero in a home 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.040
 good constitution was at that time and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.020
 that's just fun to see 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.670
 that he ever leverkusen that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.190
 now he has to also be a coach 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.700
 courage proves something to change over 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 player to play next to like 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.660
 a bella vida in braunschweig im 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 Last year has barely played with the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.300
 reason he could defend me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.890
 When I live in Brunswick I have that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.940
 a little bit more intense 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.680
 our press is written there 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.059
 There has always been great player in it 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.710
 the offensive if he has the ball but 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.539
 Defensive does not work but if I do 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 Today, as he does with the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.350
 team together forward 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 what he defends for the team 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.220
 it also shows that it is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.869
 just a coach is something 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.950
 player at the end is ready to perform 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.659
 what can also do 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 Karin came back from Brunswick 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 They delivered Brunswick to them 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.049
 had played Brunswick 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.100
 He even made some games on the bench 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:24.450
 he did not allow that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 played back naturally had 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.799
 We then ask him again 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.720
 wanted to borrow and then we have ourselves 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.829
 composed and said in peace 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.479
 He looks at rest 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.150
 in the training camp in Austria the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 first friendlies and afterwards 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.000
 Do you know what we are going to do? 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.380
 karim and then he immediately noticed 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 after the first training sessions 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.329
 the first friendship game he did 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.710
 for a quality that we always 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.329
 That's why we always only knew 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 borrowed because he has a tremendous pace 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.250
 dribbling had great shot and what 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 is very important now times 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.730
 right fit was, as we said fits times 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.530
 want to fight a whole year out of action 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.360
 I would be wrong 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.290
 shame leg injury had to be times 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.240
 has broken up again 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.820
 now makes the pottery impression and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 what a staff you can still do 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:16.120
 discuss christoph kramer is coming back 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:18.520
 want to say back that's it 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.380
 our concept for many years 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.780
 and now all the more because we have ours 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.050
 We have unsubscribed from the second team 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.610
 Lend talented young players from the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.650
 A youth does not immediately manage in the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.510
 first team which is very difficult 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.460
 and sometimes one more two three 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.200
 Years then need a certain amount 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.510
 quality and also to have a time of penance 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.040
 the laughter first out of ours 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.390
 concept and then we try the to 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.460
 Action is in the past 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.930
 already another time worked out like 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.980
 other clubs that we represent have 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.780
 yes toni kroos times in leverkusen 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.380
 gave the name back 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.100
 forget everything and cristiana that is 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.100
 a great boy 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.700
 there are only at this time 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.650
 winner in the history of the chamer 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.700
 even a gladbach a great season 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.190
 last year already played 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.959
 become world champion 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.320
 last year gladbacher are 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.030
 Satisfied and we have great games 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.650
 player the top has been trained 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.850
 We'll have it again next summer 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.850
 it's that easy
