00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
floor unit and a little thing goes in

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.150 
floor unit and a little thing goes in
neutral<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:52.090> 55<00:00:52.780> models<00:00:53.379> smaller

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
neutral so the 55 models smaller

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.200 
neutral so the 55 models smaller
outboards<00:00:54.870> didn't<00:00:55.870> have<00:00:56.020> reverse<00:00:56.410> but<00:00:57.210> can't

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
outboards didn't have reverse but can't

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.299 
outboards didn't have reverse but can't
do<00:00:58.449> it<00:00:58.570> on<00:00:58.660> this<00:00:58.809> stand<00:00:59.140> but<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.860> thing<00:01:00.100> will

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
do it on this stand but this thing will

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.100 
do it on this stand but this thing will
reverse<00:01:00.670> all<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.059> way<00:01:01.300> around<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:04.270> your

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
reverse all the way around for your

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.370 
reverse all the way around for your
reverse<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.399> it'll<00:01:06.610> twist<00:01:06.810> 360<00:01:07.810> degrees<00:01:08.350> so

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
reverse so it'll twist 360 degrees so

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.580 
reverse so it'll twist 360 degrees so
that's<00:01:08.710> how<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:08.890> got<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.040> reverse<00:01:09.369> on<00:01:09.610> here<00:01:09.850> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that's how you got a reverse on here and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.710 
that's how you got a reverse on here and
it<00:01:11.590> has<00:01:11.799> a<00:01:11.979> neutral<00:01:12.189> so<00:01:12.729> that's<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.150> really

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
it has a neutral so that's a really

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.620 
it has a neutral so that's a really
unique<00:01:13.930> little<00:01:14.640> feature<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.150> can<00:01:16.360> start
