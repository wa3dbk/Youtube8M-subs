00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
difficult but at the end it's with the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.200 
difficult but at the end it's with the
guys<00:03:34.900> we<00:03:35.110> are<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.650> little<00:03:35.950> family<00:03:36.210> the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
guys we are like a little family the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.370 
guys we are like a little family the
relationship<00:03:37.630> between<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.930> driver<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.260> the

relationship between the driver and the
mechanics<00:03:38.770> is<00:03:38.950> closed<00:03:39.340> because<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:39.910> do<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.270> lot

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
doing the best job and if that means

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.120 
doing the best job and if that means
rotating<00:05:18.990> people<00:05:19.110> then<00:05:19.410> we<00:05:19.500> do<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.800> of

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
rotating people then we do that of

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.770 
rotating people then we do that of
course<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.880> not<00:05:21.060> nice<00:05:21.270> for<00:05:21.300> them<00:05:21.570> if<00:05:21.690> we

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
course it's not nice for them if we

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.480 
course it's not nice for them if we
change<00:05:22.020> them<00:05:22.200> but<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.680> doesn't<00:05:22.950> mean<00:05:23.100> if<00:05:23.340> we

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
change them but it doesn't mean if we

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.460 
change them but it doesn't mean if we
change<00:05:23.730> them<00:05:23.910> they<00:05:24.180> finished<00:05:24.600> forever<00:05:24.780> they

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
change them they finished forever they

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.460 
change them they finished forever they
can<00:05:25.650> work<00:05:25.770> harder<00:05:26.100> and<00:05:26.220> come<00:05:26.340> back

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.790 

I<00:05:37.780> think<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:38.870> most<00:05:39.050> important<00:05:39.440> thing<00:05:39.590> for<00:05:39.710> a

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
I think the most important thing for a

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.790 
I think the most important thing for a
pit<00:05:39.980> stop<00:05:40.250> is<00:05:40.460> to<00:05:40.660> know<00:05:41.660> for<00:05:42.200> myself<00:05:42.320> as<00:05:42.770> a

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
pit stop is to know for myself as a

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.880 
pit stop is to know for myself as a
driver<00:05:43.160> not<00:05:43.970> to<00:05:44.030> try<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:44.420> overdo<00:05:45.080> it<00:05:45.110> it's<00:05:45.590> not

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
driver not to try and overdo it it's not

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.740 
driver not to try and overdo it it's not
to<00:05:46.070> panic<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.550> just<00:05:47.000> to<00:05:47.090> be<00:05:47.210> smooth<00:05:47.510> and

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
to panic and just to be smooth and

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.350 
to panic and just to be smooth and
precise<00:05:48.290> a<00:05:48.800> good<00:05:49.370> pit<00:05:49.580> stop<00:05:49.820> is<00:05:49.940> a<00:05:50.000> balance

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
precise a good pit stop is a balance

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.450 
precise a good pit stop is a balance
between<00:05:50.650> consistency<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:51.800> absolute<00:05:52.190> speed

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
between consistency and absolute speed

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.670 
between consistency and absolute speed
it's<00:05:53.030> no<00:05:53.300> good<00:05:53.540> for<00:05:53.600> us<00:05:53.870> to<00:05:54.020> do<00:05:54.110> pit<00:05:54.320> stops<00:05:54.560> in

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
it's no good for us to do pit stops in

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.230 
it's no good for us to do pit stops in
two<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:54.890> a<00:05:54.920> half<00:05:55.040> seconds<00:05:55.490> if<00:05:55.640> the<00:05:55.700> next<00:05:56.090> one

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
two and a half seconds if the next one

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.000 
two and a half seconds if the next one
is<00:05:56.360> ten<00:05:56.540> seconds<00:05:56.900> because<00:05:57.440> if<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.620> driver<00:05:57.860> is

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
is ten seconds because if the driver is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.560 
is ten seconds because if the driver is
stopping<00:05:58.280> three<00:05:58.550> times<00:05:58.790> during<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.150> Grand<00:05:59.360> Prix

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
stopping three times during a Grand Prix

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.230 
stopping three times during a Grand Prix
they<00:06:00.020> all<00:06:00.170> have<00:06:00.410> to<00:06:00.530> be<00:06:00.560> good<00:06:00.850> and<00:06:01.850> so<00:06:02.090> it's

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
they all have to be good and so it's

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.730 
they all have to be good and so it's
very<00:06:02.390> important<00:06:02.930> consistency<00:06:03.590> it's

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
very important consistency it's

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.010 
very important consistency it's
something<00:06:03.950> we<00:06:04.070> work<00:06:04.250> hard<00:06:04.550> on<00:06:04.750> extent<00:06:05.750> and

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
something we work hard on extent and

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.720 
something we work hard on extent and
this<00:06:06.110> might<00:06:06.350> sound<00:06:06.530> strange<00:06:06.740> where<00:06:07.100> we<00:06:07.490> tell

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
this might sound strange where we tell

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.610 
this might sound strange where we tell
them<00:06:07.880> to<00:06:07.970> actually<00:06:08.120> slow<00:06:08.540> down<00:06:08.570> a<00:06:08.750> bit<00:06:08.870> because

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
them to actually slow down a bit because

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.620 
them to actually slow down a bit because
in<00:06:10.160> practice<00:06:10.610> we<00:06:10.760> can<00:06:10.880> do<00:06:10.970> pit<00:06:11.180> stops<00:06:11.420> that<00:06:11.510> are

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
in practice we can do pit stops that are

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.630 
in practice we can do pit stops that are
two<00:06:11.810> point<00:06:12.020> two<00:06:12.140> seconds<00:06:12.530> if<00:06:13.070> we<00:06:13.280> do<00:06:13.400> that<00:06:13.520> in

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
two point two seconds if we do that in

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.010 
two point two seconds if we do that in
the<00:06:13.730> race<00:06:13.910> at<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.210> moment<00:06:14.570> we'll<00:06:14.810> probably

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
the race at the moment we'll probably

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.810 
the race at the moment we'll probably
make<00:06:15.260> a<00:06:15.320> mistake<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:15.890> we'll<00:06:16.010> have<00:06:16.130> to<00:06:16.550> at<00:06:16.670> two

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
make a mistake and we'll have to at two

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.250 
make a mistake and we'll have to at two
point<00:06:17.060> two<00:06:17.210> and<00:06:17.360> then<00:06:17.690> the<00:06:17.780> next<00:06:17.960> one<00:06:18.080> might<00:06:18.230> be

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
point two and then the next one might be

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.720 
point two and then the next one might be
four<00:06:18.650> point<00:06:18.860> five<00:06:19.010> that's<00:06:19.250> no<00:06:19.430> good<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.700> us

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
four point five that's no good to us

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.670 
four point five that's no good to us
we'd<00:06:20.540> be<00:06:20.570> perfectly<00:06:21.020> happy<00:06:21.170> with<00:06:21.470> them<00:06:21.560> all

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
we'd be perfectly happy with them all

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.610 
we'd be perfectly happy with them all
being<00:06:21.920> 2.8<00:06:22.880> 2.9<00:06:23.120> we'd<00:06:23.720> be<00:06:23.810> happy<00:06:24.050> with<00:06:24.140> that<00:06:24.170> so

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
being 2.8 2.9 we'd be happy with that so

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.800 
being 2.8 2.9 we'd be happy with that so
so<00:06:24.860> it's<00:06:25.010> a<00:06:25.070> mixture<00:06:25.340> of<00:06:25.460> absolute<00:06:26.240> speed<00:06:26.540> but

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
so it's a mixture of absolute speed but

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:52.600 
so it's a mixture of absolute speed but
consistency<00:06:27.320> as<00:06:27.530> well

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.669
