pretty easy for little kids but what

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.650 
pretty easy for little kids but what
about<00:00:07.950> counting<00:00:08.280> by<00:00:08.400> five<00:00:08.670> tens<00:00:09.240> or<00:00:09.540> twenties

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
about counting by five tens or twenties

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.110 
about counting by five tens or twenties
yeah<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.590> think<00:00:10.740> they<00:00:11.010> forget<00:00:11.370> which<00:00:11.610> number

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
yeah I think they forget which number

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.730 
yeah I think they forget which number
comes<00:00:12.150> next<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.170> especially<00:00:13.320> when<00:00:13.650> they

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
comes next and we especially when they

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.589 
comes next and we especially when they
get<00:00:13.830> closer<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.910> use<00:00:15.089> with<00:00:15.330> fun

make us do an exercise so I can't today
I<00:00:28.800> want<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> talk<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.460> guys<00:00:29.490> about<00:00:29.730> how

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
I want to talk to you guys about how

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.440 
I want to talk to you guys about how
numbers<00:00:30.420> interact<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.619> kids<00:00:32.430> learn<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
numbers interact and how kids learn to

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.810 
numbers interact and how kids learn to
become<00:00:33.570> comfortable<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.140> numbers<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.820> one

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
become comfortable with numbers and one

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
become comfortable with numbers and one
of<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.059> ways<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:37.050> we're<00:00:37.200> teaching

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
of those ways is when we're teaching

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.400 
of those ways is when we're teaching
children<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> count<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.719> common<00:00:39.719> error<00:00:39.960> parents

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
children to count a common error parents

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
children to count a common error parents
will<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> always<00:00:41.460> saying<00:00:41.670> let's<00:00:41.879> count

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
will make is always saying let's count

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
will make is always saying let's count
to<00:00:42.239> ten<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> kids<00:00:44.040> learn<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.309> count<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> ten

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to ten and so kids learn to count to ten

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.910 
to ten and so kids learn to count to ten
and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.270> they<00:00:45.899> never<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.620> comes<00:00:46.800> next

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and then they never know what comes next

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680 
and then they never know what comes next
so<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.360> sure<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:48.660> doing

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
so what we want to make sure we're doing

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
so what we want to make sure we're doing
is<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.289> don't<00:00:49.530> stop<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> traditional

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
is we don't stop at the traditional

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.520 
is we don't stop at the traditional
benchmarks<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.719> count<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.079> kids<00:00:52.320> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
benchmarks when we count with kids so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.459 
benchmarks when we count with kids so
instead<00:00:53.219> sigh<00:00:53.460> let's<00:00:53.670> count<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.030> 14<00:00:54.469> let's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
instead sigh let's count to 14 let's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.160 
instead sigh let's count to 14 let's
count<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.070> twenty<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.760> instead<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.660> 220

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
count to twenty two instead of just 220

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.740 
count to twenty two instead of just 220
same<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.730> near<00:00:59.760> 100<00:01:00.359> kids

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
same thing when we get up near 100 kids

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
same thing when we get up near 100 kids
will<00:01:00.930> go<00:01:01.370> 98<00:01:02.370> 99<00:01:02.969> 100<00:01:03.920> 200<00:01:04.920> 300<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:06.030> don't

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
will go 98 99 100 200 300 for they don't

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.149 
will go 98 99 100 200 300 for they don't
know<00:01:06.450> how<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> numbers<00:01:07.229> interact<00:01:07.650> after<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
know how the numbers interact after that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
know how the numbers interact after that
so<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:09.930> through<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.200> couple

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so we're going to go through a couple

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.010 
so we're going to go through a couple
different<00:01:10.860> chants<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> songs<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:15.630> dance<00:01:15.689> on

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
different chants and songs to dance on

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
different chants and songs to dance on
brace<00:01:16.979> yourself<00:01:17.310> though<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:18.330> kids<00:01:18.570> learn<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
brace yourself though when kids learn to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
brace yourself though when kids learn to
count<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.259> tally<00:01:19.619> marks<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
count they do tally marks and we do that

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
count they do tally marks and we do that
with<00:01:21.299> sports<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:22.020> write<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.290> four

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
with sports when we write the four

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
with sports when we write the four
numbers<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.460> vertical<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.090> four<00:01:24.479> lines

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
numbers that are vertical or four lines

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
numbers that are vertical or four lines
that<00:01:24.930> are<00:01:25.020> vertical<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> diagonal

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that are vertical and then the diagonal

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600 
that are vertical and then the diagonal
line<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.049> helps<00:01:28.710> teach<00:01:28.920> kids<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.310> count

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
line so that helps teach kids to count

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
line so that helps teach kids to count
by<00:01:29.729> fives<00:01:30.000> because<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.990> count<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.470> sets

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
by fives because you can count the sets

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.630 
by fives because you can count the sets
of<00:01:31.890> tally<00:01:32.220> marks<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:33.479> 5<00:01:33.750> 10<00:01:34.079> 15<00:01:34.650> 20<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.189> with

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
of tally marks like 5 10 15 20 so with

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.480 
of tally marks like 5 10 15 20 so with
kids<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.090> say<00:01:36.329> four<00:01:36.900> lines<00:01:37.439> straight<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.220> tall

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
kids we say four lines straight and tall

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.870 
kids we say four lines straight and tall
the<00:01:38.909> fifth<00:01:39.119> line<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.740> diagonal

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.859 

we<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:44.390> for<00:01:45.110> line<00:01:45.799> straight<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.880> tall<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
we go for line straight and tall the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.210 
we go for line straight and tall the
flight<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:49.750> diagonal<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.469> we<00:01:51.649> have<00:01:51.829> a<00:01:51.860> place<00:01:52.189> in

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
flight is diagonal so we have a place in

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.889
