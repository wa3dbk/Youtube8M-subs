00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.769
 is a big plus 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.250
 as on this phone you can watch 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.239
 TV phone interface is very simple 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.030
 and convenient to have shortcuts of all 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.620
 necessary applications and functions 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.450
 in order to look at the phone 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.760
 just turn on the TV 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.990
 appropriate function to extend the antenna 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.489
 Further we will look as the device and catches 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:09.150
 here's the signal 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:12.780
 There was a search for channels and you can 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 see what we get sound 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.300
 great picture is good yet 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.070
 considering that i am now 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.370
 rather isolated room 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.370
 but the signal passes perfectly TV 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.959
 can watch internal memory 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.700
 very little on the phone 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.920
 that is not enough therefore it must 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.410
 needs to be expanded with micro sd 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.140
 cards are well supported 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.670
 up to 32 gigabyte audio player here 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.130
 it is simple and convenient 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.019
 At first, you can use your own 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.780
 headset to audition 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.250
 music but of course 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:55.950
 recommend buying something better than 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.930
 these 0.3 megapixel camera headphones 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.250
 makes quite tolerable photos for 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.970
 order to send m in general this 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.230
 cute multifunction phone 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.120

 because on it you can watch telly 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.670
 recommend shopping 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.799

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.480
