00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.820
 we started from a slab that was 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.149
 practically empty from there from an area of 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.539
 storage at about 500 meters 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.479
 we started taking walls 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.760
 materially from an articulated lorry that is 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.479
 departed from chienes from where we have one 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.969
 seat and materially one we have 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.290
 started to position them directly 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.449
 on the slab 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.060
 the walls are about three or 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.880
 four meters have a weight of about 850 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.210
 kg each for a weight speech 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.210
 and wind at helicopter level 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.010
 the whole ritual amount is even more 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.430
 annoying too well after all otherwise 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.410
 ilaria is condensation and benefits are 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.650
 mainly those today as we have 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.320
 energies and you have to make them low houses 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.690
 main energy consumption 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.020
 the saab inhabitants the technician goes inside 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.810
 in the still in the house it is still not there 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.730
 problem if one lives below can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 quietly build a floor above 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.720
 without problems to have at home in 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.170
 This was it took us went to the 15 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 minutes 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.370
 we are talking about an elevation 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.080
 a superelevation means that al 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.120
 first floor of this house there 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.300
 people live and therefore the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.260
 speed is crucial within two 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.750
 weeks 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.510
 we give the customer a turnkey solution 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.730
 it means having two for two weeks 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.030
 of the people working on the site 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.410
 instead of so many other days of 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.330
 work in the traditional 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.420
 after which the healthiness is very much 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.970
 important because the whole structure is 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.489
 in wood and fir wood and 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.690
 immaterial saints are wood fiber and 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.840
 then cork all the materials 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.910
 natural that make breathe and island 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.910
 very well from heat and cold 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.330
 fortunately usually the most 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.610
 part of the yards have accessibility 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.470
 and therefore with the articulated vehicle with the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.260
 motor we calmly arrive 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.700
 in the yard and directly with a car 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.610
 blue we can take 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.350
 from the articulated vehicle to the construction site 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.630
 soletta let's call it materially 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.569
 slab walls 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.880
 after which if a house gives you an idea of 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.550
 about 100 120 square meters 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.590
 us on the first day of assembly if the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.269
 time is nice keep succeeding 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 quietly closing the insole 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.550
 therefore in terms of timing in one 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.890
 day we can make a home of 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.540
 these dimensions here we are today 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.640
 been very fast because 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.620
 obviously the helicopter required us to 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.130
 be even faster for the areas 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.370
 where always earthquake is in my opinion a 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.680
 home so even if a person likes her 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.040
 miur I also wanted a house like this 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.160
 quality you need to make innovations every 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.920
 year never be chickpea of t termi 6 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.790
 offside a company like the room e 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.370
 raoul which is a brand on the market from 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.799
 now sixty years that builds houses 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.430
 in wood and is certainly synonymous with 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.430
 reliability
