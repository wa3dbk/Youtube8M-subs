00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.820
 at my command fire 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.820

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:25.260
 that the attention was lost to all the survivors 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:28.790
 we can not that position but the weak spot 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.740
 it will collapse after all beam fire on the beam 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.740
 including the amount in the country gray 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:49.840

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:53.140

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.060
 captain 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.969
 I think this is only the first wave 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.850
 call under the foot 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:08.789

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.189

 which of course is not the second wave but still 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:20.480
 kill them immediately 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.409
 of course 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:42.810

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.620
