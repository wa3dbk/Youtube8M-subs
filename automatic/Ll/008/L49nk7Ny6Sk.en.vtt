00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:04.940 
get these strung on so it's going to be
a<00:03:52.500> brass<00:03:56.960> two<00:04:00.410> three<00:04:02.420> in<00:04:03.420> one<00:04:04.260> little<00:04:04.410> tip<00:04:04.740> if

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
a brass two three in one little tip if

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.530 
a brass two three in one little tip if
you're<00:04:05.190> working<00:04:05.370> with<00:04:05.550> cord<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.300> keeps

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
you're working with cord and it keeps

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.460 
you're working with cord and it keeps
getting<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.959> little<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:08.010> know<00:04:09.290> wobbly<00:04:10.290> one

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
getting a little you know wobbly one

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.199 
getting a little you know wobbly one
little<00:04:10.890> tip<00:04:11.130> that<00:04:11.280> you<00:04:11.400> can<00:04:11.430> do<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.090> can

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
little tip that you can do is you can

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.410 
little tip that you can do is you can
wrap<00:04:12.570> around<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:14.100> peg<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.459> then<00:04:14.790> clip<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.330> and

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
wrap around a peg and then clip it and

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.659 
wrap around a peg and then clip it and
it<00:04:15.510> gives<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.410> extra<00:04:16.680> tinsel

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
it gives you that up that extra tinsel

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.740 
it gives you that up that extra tinsel
strength<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:19.290> that's

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.130 

and<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:25.900> thing<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.170> remember<00:04:26.380> when<00:04:26.740> you're

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
and one thing to remember when you're

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.210 
and one thing to remember when you're
tightening<00:04:29.140> is<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:29.590> if<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.920> just<00:04:30.070> go

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
tightening is just if you just go

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.640 
tightening is just if you just go
straight<00:04:30.520> up<00:04:30.640> just<00:04:31.480> like<00:04:31.600> I'm<00:04:31.780> doing<00:04:32.110> one

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
straight up just like I'm doing one

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.590 
straight up just like I'm doing one
thing<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.920> don't<00:04:33.100> want<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.400> do<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:34.420> you<00:04:34.510> don't

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
thing you don't want to do is you don't

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.180 
thing you don't want to do is you don't
want<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.870> pull<00:04:35.110> downward<00:04:35.800> because<00:04:35.950> then

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
want to pull downward because then

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.550 
want to pull downward because then
you're<00:04:36.340> not<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:37.120> won't<00:04:37.480> end<00:04:37.750> up<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.320> know<00:04:38.350> next

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
you're not it won't end up you know next

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.260 
you're not it won't end up you know next
year<00:04:38.650> beat<00:04:38.890> it'll<00:04:39.070> end<00:04:39.250> up<00:04:39.370> maybe<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:40.150> know

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
year beat it'll end up maybe you know

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.210 
year beat it'll end up maybe you know
about<00:04:40.660> half<00:04:40.960> an<00:04:41.080> inch<00:04:41.170> away<00:04:41.380> from<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.920> so<00:04:41.950> you

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
about half an inch away from it so you

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:51.120 
about half an inch away from it so you
just<00:04:44.370> tighten<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.460> just<00:04:45.670> like<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:49.950> see<00:04:50.950> now

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
just tighten it just like that see now

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.490 
just tighten it just like that see now
it's<00:04:51.610> exactly<00:04:52.090> seven<00:04:52.420> inches<00:04:52.750> which<00:04:53.020> was<00:04:53.320> our

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
it's exactly seven inches which was our

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.380 
it's exactly seven inches which was our
target<00:04:54.370> length<00:04:54.700> an<00:04:54.820> we're<00:04:54.910> going<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> add<00:04:55.210> the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
target length an we're going to add the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.960 
target length an we're going to add the
loop<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:56.230> extender<00:04:56.650> chain<00:04:56.760> you<00:04:57.760> just

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
loop and the extender chain you just

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.880 
loop and the extender chain you just
attach<00:04:58.450> what<00:04:59.200> I'm<00:04:59.260> doing<00:04:59.470> is<00:04:59.530> I'm<00:04:59.590> getting<00:04:59.800> my

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
attach what I'm doing is I'm getting my

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.350 
attach what I'm doing is I'm getting my
extender<00:05:00.280> chain<00:05:00.310> on<00:05:00.730> putting<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.120> through

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
extender chain on putting it through

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.230 
extender chain on putting it through
both<00:05:04.440> putting<00:05:05.440> both<00:05:05.620> ends<00:05:05.980> through<00:05:06.190> the<00:05:06.240> last

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
both putting both ends through the last

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.230 
both putting both ends through the last
loop<00:05:07.360> on<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.690> chain<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.580> now<00:05:09.580> this<00:05:09.760> is<00:05:09.940> where

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
loop on the chain and now this is where

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.850 
loop on the chain and now this is where
we<00:05:10.390> start<00:05:10.720> that's<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.290> nice<00:05:11.470> thing<00:05:11.620> about<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
we start that's the nice thing about the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.710 
we start that's the nice thing about the
pegs<00:05:12.100> or<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:12.790> can<00:05:12.970> move<00:05:13.180> them<00:05:13.480> and<00:05:13.600> we're

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
pegs or you can move them and we're

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.240 
pegs or you can move them and we're
going<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.900> start<00:05:14.110> like<00:05:14.530> sort<00:05:14.860> of<00:05:14.890> twiki

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
going to start like sort of twiki

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.010 
going to start like sort of twiki
because<00:05:15.520> we<00:05:15.610> want<00:05:15.820> about<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:16.780> know<00:05:16.900> maybe

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
because we want about you know maybe

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.230 
because we want about you know maybe
about<00:05:17.530> a<00:05:17.560> half<00:05:17.830> an<00:05:18.010> inch<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.490> here<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.150> we

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
about a half an inch in here so that we

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.800 
about a half an inch in here so that we
could<00:05:19.360> put<00:05:19.540> a<00:05:19.680> coil<00:05:20.680> knot<00:05:20.980> and<00:05:21.400> see<00:05:22.120> nice<00:05:22.570> thing

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
could put a coil knot and see nice thing

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.970 
could put a coil knot and see nice thing
is<00:05:22.930> that<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.110> can<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:23.620> know<00:05:23.710> it's<00:05:23.830> very

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
is that you can you know it's very

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.100 
is that you can you know it's very
adjustable<00:05:24.100> so<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:24.970> can<00:05:25.120> actually<00:05:25.570> get<00:05:25.960> the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
adjustable so you can actually get the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.730 
adjustable so you can actually get the
distance<00:05:26.620> that<00:05:27.430> you're<00:05:27.670> looking<00:05:27.940> for<00:05:28.180> which

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
distance that you're looking for which

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.590 
distance that you're looking for which
for<00:05:29.740> me<00:05:29.860> right<00:05:30.130> now<00:05:30.160> that<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.820> perfect<00:05:31.240> that's

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
for me right now that is perfect that's

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.990 
for me right now that is perfect that's
exactly<00:05:32.050> what<00:05:32.680> I'm<00:05:32.800> looking<00:05:33.160> for<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.610> little

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
exactly what I'm looking for that little

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.730 
exactly what I'm looking for that little
it's<00:05:34.810> not<00:05:35.020> it's<00:05:35.230> called

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
it's not it's called

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.460 
it's not it's called
I<00:05:36.010> call<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.490> coil<00:05:36.820> not<00:05:37.200> because<00:05:38.200> what<00:05:38.380> you

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
I call it the coil not because what you

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.760 
I call it the coil not because what you
simply<00:05:38.830> do<00:05:39.010> is<00:05:39.280> you<00:05:39.520> just<00:05:39.870> coil<00:05:40.870> your<00:05:41.320> cord

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
simply do is you just coil your cord

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:48.720 
simply do is you just coil your cord
around<00:05:44.130> your<00:05:45.130> piece<00:05:45.910> like<00:05:46.180> this<00:05:46.540> and<00:05:47.490> one<00:05:48.490> end

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
around your piece like this and one end

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.480 
around your piece like this and one end
you'll<00:05:49.690> feed<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.080> through<00:05:50.350> your<00:05:50.890> coils<00:05:51.250> going

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
you'll feed it through your coils going

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.100 
you'll feed it through your coils going
this<00:05:51.730> way<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.150> this<00:05:52.480> end<00:05:52.780> you're<00:05:52.930> going<00:05:53.020> to

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
this way and this end you're going to

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.440 
this way and this end you're going to
feed<00:05:53.290> it<00:05:53.440> in<00:05:53.590> going<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.370> other<00:05:54.400> way<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:54.880> if

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
feed it in going the other way and if

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.510 
feed it in going the other way and if
it's<00:05:55.600> a<00:05:55.690> little<00:05:55.960> tight<00:05:56.230> you<00:05:56.470> could<00:05:56.890> take<00:05:57.130> one

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
it's a little tight you could take one

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.980 
it's a little tight you could take one
of<00:05:57.640> the<00:05:57.730> Reimers<00:05:58.090> that<00:05:58.270> comes<00:05:58.480> with<00:05:58.630> your<00:05:58.750> kit

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
of the Reimers that comes with your kit

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.590 
of the Reimers that comes with your kit
and<00:05:59.530> just<00:05:59.740> simply<00:06:00.100> kind<00:06:01.000> of<00:06:01.060> wiggle<00:06:01.420> it<00:06:01.480> in
