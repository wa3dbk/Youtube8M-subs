00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello today I'm going to show you how to prepare 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.599
 the magnesium chloride we need the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.070
 following materials a container of 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:21.159
 glass a glass or plastic glass but 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.439
 It recommended in the glass vessel an 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:27.609
 wooden spoon that is also going to 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:30.789
 serve as a doser here we have the 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.660
 Magnesium chloride powder 100% pure 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:38.440
 in the presentation of 66 grams this 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.710
 let's dissolve 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.469
 in two liters of cold boiled water 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.870
 or it can also be bottled water without 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.270
 gas 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.270
 we proceed to open the envelope 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.640
 and we mix it 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.799
 we mix it in the water 2 liters 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.430
 in 2 liters of water with the spoon 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.450
 wood we proceed to dissolve until 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 crystallize 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.470
 as you will see this is dissolving 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.780
 eye that the spoon has to be of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.390
 wood plus no metal has to be of 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 wood ready 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.830
 of this preparation 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.890
 let's take four spoons 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.760
 what does a dose of this 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.760
 4 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.340
 this is the shot that we are going to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.280
 take what we can we can add water 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.720
 bottled without gas 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 cold boiled water or just juice 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.170
 orange or orange juice 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.790
 in this case we are going to add water 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.080
 boiled 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.790
 an amount 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.790
 this is what we are going to take 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.380
 we can take it three times a day can 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.380
 be the case depending twice 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.850
 as you will see how easy it is to prepare the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.220
 magnesium chloride 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.160
 later we will be presenting 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.160
 videos of how to take in different cases
