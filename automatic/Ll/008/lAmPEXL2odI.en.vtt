staff videos a bunch of staff stuff

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
staff videos a bunch of staff stuff
because<00:00:14.849> I'm<00:00:14.969> really<00:00:15.089> inspired<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:15.990> stuff

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
because I'm really inspired with stuff

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
because I'm really inspired with stuff
right<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.039> think<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:18.210> it's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
right now and I think I think it's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.890

be using my much-loved
collapsible<00:00:30.720> flow<00:00:31.019> light<00:00:31.260> stubs<00:00:31.650> which<00:00:32.189> are

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
collapsible flow light stubs which are

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.420 
collapsible flow light stubs which are
my<00:00:32.600> main<00:00:33.600> practice<00:00:33.960> set<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
my main practice set these this but I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.520 
my main practice set these this but I
started<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.300> something<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:37.079> lot<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
started with something a lot more the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.930 
started with something a lot more the
DIY<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> show<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> how<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> make

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.750 
or one of the ways to make a nice pair
of<00:00:44.690> would<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.809> practice<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.469> home<00:00:46.760> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of would in practice that's at home you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690 
of would in practice that's at home you
need<00:00:47.940> two<00:00:48.600> wooden<00:00:48.899> dowels<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.590> means<00:00:50.399> round

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
need two wooden dowels that means round

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
need two wooden dowels that means round
sticks<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.410> any<00:00:52.590> hardware

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
sticks and we can get any hardware

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
sticks and we can get any hardware
stores<00:00:53.219> ask<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.699> dowel<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.210> couple<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> used

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
stores ask for dowel a couple of used

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.939 
stores ask for dowel a couple of used
bike<00:00:55.890> inner<00:00:56.280> tubes<00:00:56.899> once<00:00:57.899> again<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.379> couldn't

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
bike inner tubes once again I couldn't

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729 
bike inner tubes once again I couldn't
get<00:00:59.399> used<00:00:59.879> bike<00:01:00.239> inner<00:01:00.510> tubes<00:01:00.780> any<00:01:01.410> bike

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

get used bike inner tubes any bike
repair<00:01:02.070> store<00:01:02.370> will<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> bunch<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.870> we

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
repair store will have a bunch but we

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
these are big I'm gonna cut these in

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.710 
these are big I'm gonna cut these in
half<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:33.420> careful<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.840> your<00:01:33.990> knife<00:01:35.720> so

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.929 

you<00:01:41.790> take<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.299> piece<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:54.660 

fuck<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.600> attach<00:01:49.899> that<00:01:52.259> onto<00:01:53.259> there<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.740> then

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
fuck you attach that onto there and then

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.929 
fuck you attach that onto there and then
you<00:01:54.789> just<00:01:54.969> roll<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:59.219> and<00:02:00.219> roll<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.579> all<00:02:00.700> on

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
you just roll it all and roll it all on

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.609 
you just roll it all and roll it all on
to<00:02:01.329> end<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.049> stick<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:04.350> keep<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.469> pretty

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
to end of the stick I keep it pretty

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.219 
to end of the stick I keep it pretty
tight<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.090> want<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.420> keep<00:02:07.600> well<00:02:08.019> then<00:02:08.110> that

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
tight so you want to keep well then that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.280 
tight so you want to keep well then that
makes<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.470> really<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:10.390> all<00:02:10.660> it's<00:02:11.049> gonna<00:02:11.170> be

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
makes it really it's all it's gonna be

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.479 
makes it really it's all it's gonna be
very<00:02:11.379> secure<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.799> way<00:02:12.010> if<00:02:12.129> you<00:02:12.190> put<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.400> on

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
very secure that way if you put it on

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.240 
very secure that way if you put it on
the<00:02:12.610> loose<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.090> can<00:02:13.209> unravel<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:15.069> make<00:02:15.220> sure

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the loose it can unravel so make sure

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.720 
the loose it can unravel so make sure
you're<00:02:15.580> really<00:02:15.790> kind<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.060> pulling<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
you're really kind of pulling and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.160 
you're really kind of pulling and
pulling<00:02:19.180> as<00:02:19.599> your<00:02:19.870> wrap<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.780> when<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.930> get<00:02:23.019> to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
pulling as your wrap and when you get to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:37.380 
pulling as your wrap and when you get to
the<00:02:23.260> end<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.590> take<00:02:23.739> another<00:02:36.329> there's<00:02:37.329> a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the end you take another there's a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
the end you take another there's a
couple<00:02:37.630> things<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.989> gives<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.769> weight

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
couple things that gives you the weight

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.089 
couple things that gives you the weight
the<00:02:39.579> way<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.880> want<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.739> well<00:02:41.739> actually<00:02:41.860> it's
