show we're attaching rivets
I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.869> sewing<00:00:22.259> your<00:00:22.380> own<00:00:22.529> jeans<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:23.009> home

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
I think sewing your own jeans at home

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.890 
I think sewing your own jeans at home
has<00:00:23.310> become<00:00:23.430> increasingly<00:00:24.119> popular<00:00:24.210> over<00:00:24.599> the

to 908 women's stretch jeans pattern I

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.560 
to 908 women's stretch jeans pattern I
think<00:00:29.579> a<00:00:29.640> lot<00:00:29.759> of<00:00:29.849> people<00:00:30.059> are<00:00:30.149> realizing<00:00:30.540> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
think a lot of people are realizing that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.940 
think a lot of people are realizing that
they<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.899> actually<00:00:31.020> make<00:00:31.320> jeans<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> look

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
they can actually make jeans that look

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.240 
they can actually make jeans that look
good<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.640> fit<00:00:32.850> right<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.960> home<00:00:34.230> no<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.130> to

good and fit right at home no need to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
good and fit right at home no need to
buy<00:00:35.340> ready-to-wear<00:00:35.820> anymore<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.809> problem<00:00:37.200> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
buy ready-to-wear anymore the problem is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.600 
buy ready-to-wear anymore the problem is
is<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.710> make<00:00:37.860> your<00:00:38.070> jeans<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.399> home<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
is when you make your jeans at home a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 
is when you make your jeans at home a
lot<00:00:38.880> of<00:00:38.940> times<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.300> look<00:00:39.600> homemade

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
lot of times they can look homemade

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.290 
lot of times they can look homemade
which<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.040> okay<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.370> me<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.910> some<00:00:42.030> people

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
which is okay for me but some people

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.820 
which is okay for me but some people
want<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> look<00:00:42.780> more<00:00:42.840> ready<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.380> ready<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
want them to look more ready to ready to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.010 
want them to look more ready to ready to
wear<00:00:44.150> one<00:00:45.150> way<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.810> jeans

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
wear one way you can make your jeans

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.840 
wear one way you can make your jeans
look<00:00:46.170> more<00:00:46.530> ready-to-wear<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.010> by<00:00:47.250> using<00:00:47.490> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
look more ready-to-wear is by using the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.010 
look more ready-to-wear is by using the
appropriate<00:00:48.090> hardware<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.870> rivets<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:51.020> we're

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
appropriate hardware or rivets so we're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.480 
appropriate hardware or rivets so we're
going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.200> talk<00:00:52.350> about<00:00:52.380> how<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.740> attach<00:00:53.040> rivets

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
going to talk about how to attach rivets

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.940 
going to talk about how to attach rivets
you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.780> certainly<00:00:55.079> buy<00:00:55.290> expensive

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
you can certainly buy expensive

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.520 
you can certainly buy expensive
equipment<00:00:56.400> there's<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
equipment there's it's like a kind of a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.400 
equipment there's it's like a kind of a
press<00:00:58.860> with<00:00:59.130> special<00:00:59.640> dyes<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.230> attach<00:01:01.230> your

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
press with special dyes to attach your

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.630 
press with special dyes to attach your
rivets<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:01.950> going<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.130> make<00:01:02.220> hundreds

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
rivets if you're going to make hundreds

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
rivets if you're going to make hundreds
of<00:01:02.760> pairs<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.000> jeans<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.360> think<00:01:03.510> that's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
of pairs of jeans I think that's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
of pairs of jeans I think that's
probably<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.199> should<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.619> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
probably the way you should do it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560 
probably the way you should do it
if<00:01:05.519> you're<00:01:05.700> only<00:01:05.790> getting<00:01:05.970> making<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> few

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
if you're only getting making a few

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940 
if you're only getting making a few
pairs<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> jeans<00:01:07.079> though<00:01:07.290> buying<00:01:07.649> expensive

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
pairs of jeans though buying expensive

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.789 
pairs of jeans though buying expensive
equipment<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.579> probably<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> go

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
equipment is probably not the way to go

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
equipment is probably not the way to go
so<00:01:10.799> I'm<00:01:11.759> going<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> show<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.149> what<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.720> do

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so I'm going to show you what you can do

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.270 
so I'm going to show you what you can do
at<00:01:13.140> home<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.409> attach<00:01:13.950> rivets<00:01:14.610> successfully

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
at home to attach rivets successfully

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.129 
at home to attach rivets successfully
what<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.639> to<00:01:17.789> use<00:01:17.969> is<00:01:18.240> something<00:01:18.479> called<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:19.139 
what I like to use is something called a

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:21.499 
what I like to use is something called a
bench<00:01:19.319> block<00:01:19.530> these<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.639> available<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:21.359> can

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
bench block these are available you can

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.809 
bench block these are available you can
probably<00:01:21.719> pick<00:01:21.929> them<00:01:22.109> up<00:01:22.200> cheapest<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.159> eBay

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
probably pick them up cheapest on eBay

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.580 
probably pick them up cheapest on eBay
I<00:01:23.850> think<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.420> cost<00:01:24.630> me<00:01:24.749> less<00:01:24.869> than<00:01:25.049> $20

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I think that's cost me less than $20

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160 
I think that's cost me less than $20
after<00:01:26.159> shipping<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.450> use<00:01:27.600> any<00:01:27.840> any

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
after shipping you can use any any

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.989 
after shipping you can use any any
really<00:01:28.679> smooth<00:01:29.009> metal<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:29.969> be

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
really smooth metal but it has to be

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.819 
really smooth metal but it has to be
thick<00:01:30.329> enough<00:01:30.359> where<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.319> pound<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
thick enough where you can pound on it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
thick enough where you can pound on it
with<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> hammer<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.429> it's<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.819> to<00:01:32.880> hold<00:01:33.060> its

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
with a hammer and it's going to hold its

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.620 
with a hammer and it's going to hold its
shape<00:01:33.499> so<00:01:34.609> the<00:01:35.609> bench<00:01:35.789> block<00:01:35.999> is<00:01:36.209> probably<00:01:36.539> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
shape so the bench block is probably the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.370 
shape so the bench block is probably the
easiest<00:01:36.959> way<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:39.179> other<00:01:39.380> thing

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
easiest way to do that the other thing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
easiest way to do that the other thing
to<00:01:40.499> use<00:01:40.649> a<00:01:40.679> hammer<00:01:41.039> this<00:01:41.639> is<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:42.149> a<00:01:42.240> cheap

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to use a hammer this is just a cheap

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
to use a hammer this is just a cheap
hammer<00:01:42.719> from<00:01:42.959> Home<00:01:43.109> Depot<00:01:43.340> what<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.459> do<00:01:44.670> want

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
isn't this is my clapper and I use the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.910 
isn't this is my clapper and I use the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.300 
I'll show you what I mean in a minute
but<00:02:21.140> you'll<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.440> need<00:02:21.560> some<00:02:21.800> some<00:02:22.040> sort<00:02:22.250> of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
but you'll just need some some sort of

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.020 
but you'll just need some some sort of
block<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.670> wood<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.510> hammer<00:02:23.750> your<00:02:23.930> nail<00:02:24.170> into

block of wood to hammer your nail into
so<00:02:26.230> basically<00:02:27.230> there's<00:02:27.500> three<00:02:27.560> types<00:02:27.920> of

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
so basically there's three types of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.730 
so basically there's three types of
rivets<00:02:28.370> there's<00:02:28.940> nipple<00:02:29.300> rivets<00:02:29.780> ring<00:02:30.320> rivets

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
rivets there's nipple rivets ring rivets

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.680 
rivets there's nipple rivets ring rivets
and<00:02:30.950> capped<00:02:31.400> rivets<00:02:31.850> there<00:02:32.270> are<00:02:32.360> maybe<00:02:32.510> more

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
and capped rivets there are maybe more

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.180 
and capped rivets there are maybe more
rivets<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:33.440> these<00:02:33.620> are<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.800> three<00:02:33.950> types

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
rivets but these are the three types

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.110 
rivets but these are the three types
that<00:02:34.340> I'm<00:02:34.550> aware<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:37.490> type<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.730> rivets

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
that I'm aware of the type of rivets

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.280 
that I'm aware of the type of rivets
that<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.270> could<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.900> ones<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.170> can

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
that you could so that the ones you can

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.250 
that you could so that the ones you can
attach<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.710> home<00:02:40.030> basically<00:02:41.030> would<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.960> your

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
attach at home basically would be your

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260 
attach at home basically would be your
ring<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.710> your<00:02:42.830> capped<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.610> nipple<00:02:43.970> rivet

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
ring and your capped the nipple rivet

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.600 
ring and your capped the nipple rivet
has<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.810> little<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.800> little<00:02:46.070> nipple<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.580> it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
has a little like a little nipple on it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.960 
has a little like a little nipple on it
and<00:02:47.170> because<00:02:48.170> you're<00:02:48.410> hammering<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.490> flat

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
and because you're hammering on a flat

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.450 
and because you're hammering on a flat
surface<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.780> will<00:02:51.410> distort<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.100> nipple

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
surface that will distort the nipple

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.070 
surface that will distort the nipple
that's<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.270> a<00:02:53.420> rivet<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.990> would

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
that's this is a rivet that you would

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.300 
that's this is a rivet that you would
you<00:02:54.320> would<00:02:54.410> probably<00:02:54.800> have<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.130> have<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
you would probably have to have a

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.970 
you would probably have to have a
special<00:02:55.610> die<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:57.140> you<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.710> little

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
special die to you have a little

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.760 
special die to you have a little
indention<00:02:58.520> for<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.900> attach<00:03:00.140> properly<00:03:00.320> so

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
indention for that to attach properly so

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.630 
indention for that to attach properly so
we're<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> we're<00:03:01.220> going<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.430> skip

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
we're going to we're going to skip

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.100 
we're going to we're going to skip
nipple<00:03:02.030> rivets<00:03:02.300> because<00:03:02.480> those<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:02.900> won't

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
nipple rivets because those just won't

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.210 
nipple rivets because those just won't

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.080 
on your little post it doesn't it's not
like<00:05:28.349> it'll<00:05:28.560> stay<00:05:28.860> there<00:05:29.099> it's<00:05:29.220> it's<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:30.060> know

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
like it'll stay there it's it's you know

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.000 
like it'll stay there it's it's you know
it'll<00:05:30.630> just<00:05:30.780> kind<00:05:31.169> of<00:05:31.229> balance<00:05:31.410> there<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:34.740> for

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
it'll just kind of balance there so for

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.159 
it'll just kind of balance there so for
my<00:05:35.820> bench<00:05:36.060> block<00:05:36.270> here<00:05:36.599> make<00:05:36.810> sure<00:05:36.960> I<00:05:36.990> have<00:05:37.139> a

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
my bench block here make sure I have a

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.870 
my bench block here make sure I have a
nice<00:05:37.380> smooth<00:05:37.740> spot<00:05:37.949> even<00:05:38.190> these<00:05:38.370> bench<00:05:38.580> blocks

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
nice smooth spot even these bench blocks

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.310 
nice smooth spot even these bench blocks
sometimes<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.449> one<00:05:39.599> has<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.720> scratch<00:05:40.080> on<00:05:40.199> it

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
sometimes this one has a scratch on it

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.350 
sometimes this one has a scratch on it
you<00:05:40.440> don't<00:05:40.620> if<00:05:41.220> it's<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.580> perfectly<00:05:42.000> smooth

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
you don't if it's not perfectly smooth

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.939 
you don't if it's not perfectly smooth
you<00:05:42.630> will<00:05:42.780> Mar<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.139> surface<00:05:43.169> of<00:05:43.620> your<00:05:43.740> rivet

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
you will Mar the surface of your rivet

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.939 
you will Mar the surface of your rivet
the<00:05:44.070> rivets<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.490> lot<00:05:44.639> of<00:05:44.699> times<00:05:44.880> have<00:05:45.030> finishes

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
the rivets a lot of times have finishes

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.560 
the rivets a lot of times have finishes
antiquing<00:05:46.949> type<00:05:47.220> stuff<00:05:47.580> and<00:05:47.820> that<00:05:48.330> will

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
antiquing type stuff and that will

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.480 
antiquing type stuff and that will
scratch<00:05:48.870> off

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
scratch off

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.640 
scratch off
so<00:05:51.330> I'm<00:05:51.630> going<00:05:51.750> to<00:05:51.810> turn<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.260> upside<00:05:52.620> down

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
so I'm going to turn this upside down

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.300 
so I'm going to turn this upside down
keeping<00:05:53.190> my<00:05:53.310> rivet<00:05:53.640> cap<00:05:53.850> on<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.120> bottom<00:05:54.450> and

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
keeping my rivet cap on the bottom and

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.640 
keeping my rivet cap on the bottom and
it's<00:05:56.310> kind<00:05:57.000> of<00:05:57.090> a<00:05:57.210> little<00:05:57.390> bit<00:05:57.630> you<00:05:58.140> know<00:05:58.260> it's

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
it's kind of a little bit you know it's

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.650 
it's kind of a little bit you know it's
a<00:05:58.740> little<00:05:58.920> bit<00:05:59.040> fiddly<00:05:59.280> what<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.210> like<00:06:00.390> to<00:06:00.510> do

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
a little bit fiddly what I like to do

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.520 
a little bit fiddly what I like to do
though<00:06:00.780> because<00:06:00.930> I'm<00:06:01.050> going<00:06:01.140> to<00:06:01.200> be<00:06:01.290> hammering

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
though because I'm going to be hammering

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.720 
though because I'm going to be hammering
is<00:06:01.650> I<00:06:01.740> like<00:06:01.890> to<00:06:01.920> use<00:06:02.190> you<00:06:02.400> don't<00:06:02.520> want<00:06:02.640> to

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
is I like to use you don't want to

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.100 
is I like to use you don't want to
obviously<00:06:03.180> hold<00:06:03.390> this<00:06:03.480> with<00:06:03.660> your<00:06:03.780> fingers

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
obviously hold this with your fingers

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.320 
obviously hold this with your fingers
because<00:06:04.290> you're<00:06:05.040> hammering<00:06:05.400> there<00:06:05.580> so<00:06:06.240> I'll

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
because you're hammering there so I'll

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.970 
because you're hammering there so I'll
use<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.630> fabric<00:06:06.870> to<00:06:07.230> hold<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.530> rivet<00:06:07.800> where<00:06:07.920> I

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
use the fabric to hold the rivet where I

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.240 
use the fabric to hold the rivet where I
want<00:06:08.220> it<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:09.290> then<00:06:10.290> what<00:06:10.410> I<00:06:10.470> do<00:06:10.560> is<00:06:10.920> you<00:06:11.220> just

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
want it and then what I do is you just

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.350 
want it and then what I do is you just
take<00:06:11.640> your<00:06:11.790> hammer<00:06:15.200> hammer<00:06:16.200> it<00:06:16.410> right<00:06:16.500> in<00:06:16.800> and

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
take your hammer hammer it right in and

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.660 
take your hammer hammer it right in and
it<00:06:18.360> takes<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:18.810> bit<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.250> hammering<00:06:20.250> to<00:06:20.370> do<00:06:20.520> this

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
it takes a bit of hammering to do this

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.580 
it takes a bit of hammering to do this
and<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.660> way<00:06:21.780> you<00:06:21.840> can<00:06:22.020> tell<00:06:22.200> that<00:06:22.290> it's<00:06:22.440> in

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
and the way you can tell that it's in

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.410 
and the way you can tell that it's in
far<00:06:22.860> enough<00:06:22.980> is<00:06:23.310> when<00:06:23.700> you<00:06:23.790> look<00:06:24.090> on<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:24.390> other

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
far enough is when you look on the other

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.720 
far enough is when you look on the other
side<00:06:24.900> on<00:06:25.290> the<00:06:25.590> right<00:06:25.770> side<00:06:25.800> basically<00:06:26.580> where

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
side on the right side basically where

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.330 
side on the right side basically where
the<00:06:26.820> cap<00:06:27.000> is<00:06:27.290> when<00:06:28.290> you<00:06:28.380> bend<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:28.770> fabric<00:06:28.950> you

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
the cap is when you bend the fabric you

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.970 
the cap is when you bend the fabric you
don't<00:06:29.520> want<00:06:29.700> to<00:06:29.760> see<00:06:30.030> a<00:06:30.270> lot<00:06:30.480> of<00:06:30.710> rivet<00:06:31.710> lip

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
don't want to see a lot of rivet lip

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.670 
don't want to see a lot of rivet lip
sticking<00:06:32.640> up<00:06:32.790> if<00:06:33.390> that<00:06:33.630> sticks<00:06:33.960> up<00:06:34.200> that<00:06:34.440> will

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
sticking up if that sticks up that will

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.470 
sticking up if that sticks up that will
be<00:06:34.710> what<00:06:35.220> catches<00:06:35.520> on<00:06:35.880> things

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
be what catches on things

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.910 
be what catches on things
what<00:06:37.050> scratches<00:06:37.560> your<00:06:37.710> leather<00:06:39.440> you<00:06:40.440> know<00:06:40.470> it

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920 
what scratches your leather you know it

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.830 
what scratches your leather you know it
that<00:06:41.580> that<00:06:41.820> will<00:06:42.030> be<00:06:42.150> that<00:06:42.480> will<00:06:42.630> cause

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
that that will be that will cause

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.600 
that that will be that will cause
problems<00:06:43.110> that'll<00:06:43.710> also<00:06:43.950> cause<00:06:44.130> the<00:06:44.310> rivet<00:06:44.550> to

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
problems that'll also cause the rivet to

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.270 
problems that'll also cause the rivet to
eventually<00:06:45.000> loosen<00:06:45.390> up<00:06:45.510> and<00:06:45.660> fall<00:06:46.140> off<00:06:46.170> on<00:06:47.010> the

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
eventually loosen up and fall off on the

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.190 
eventually loosen up and fall off on the
inside<00:06:47.700> you'll<00:06:48.000> see<00:06:48.240> that<00:06:48.360> the<00:06:48.570> the<00:06:48.900> inside

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
inside you'll see that the the inside

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.750 
inside you'll see that the the inside
will<00:06:49.440> slightly

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
will slightly

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.850
