00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
aquaponics system so the first thing

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.999 
aquaponics system so the first thing
we'll<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
we'll do is we're just going to put it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.490 
we'll do is we're just going to put it
in<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.670> system<00:01:48.049> see<00:01:49.049> how<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> fish

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
in the in the system see how the fish

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.899 
in the in the system see how the fish
tend<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> gather<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.340> corner<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> the

plastic bag and you see that through the
water<00:01:53.009> there<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.060> careful<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:54.479> you're

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
water there just be careful when you're

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.999 
water there just be careful when you're
getting<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> bag<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> box<00:01:55.619> because

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
getting the bag out of the box because

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.219 
getting the bag out of the box because
quite<00:01:56.250> often<00:01:56.430> some<00:01:57.210> fish<00:01:57.420> might<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.810> stuck<00:01:58.079> in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
quite often some fish might get stuck in

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.740 
quite often some fish might get stuck in
the<00:01:58.320> peak<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> plastic<00:02:00.149> bag<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.360> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the peak of the plastic bag and you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.690 
the peak of the plastic bag and you
could<00:02:01.170> inadvertently<00:02:01.439> pick<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> bag<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
could inadvertently pick the bag up and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.429 
could inadvertently pick the bag up and
actually<00:02:03.149> kill<00:02:03.360> some<00:02:03.570> fish<00:02:03.750> yourself<00:02:03.899> by<00:02:04.320> your

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
actually kill some fish yourself by your

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.740 
actually kill some fish yourself by your
own<00:02:04.500> hand<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.790> can't<00:02:06.030> stress<00:02:06.299> enough<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.630> be

own hand so I can't stress enough to be

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.029 
own hand so I can't stress enough to be
careful<00:02:07.140> when<00:02:07.229> you're<00:02:07.350> lifting<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> bag<00:02:07.860> out

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

of<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.159> box<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:09.030> lifted<00:02:09.360> by<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> top<00:02:09.840> we've

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
of the box to lifted by the top we've

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.069 
of the box to lifted by the top we've
got<00:02:10.409> the<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.979> great<00:02:11.939> big<00:02:12.180> knot<00:02:12.689> here<00:02:12.900> that's

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
got the the great big knot here that's

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.170 
got the the great big knot here that's
been<00:02:13.200> tied<00:02:13.499> with<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> rubber<00:02:13.950> band<00:02:14.159> lifted<00:02:15.059> out

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
been tied with a rubber band lifted out

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.759 
been tied with a rubber band lifted out
by<00:02:15.329> that<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.749> carefully<00:02:16.109> then<00:02:16.260> put<00:02:16.469> your<00:02:16.590> hand

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
by that and carefully then put your hand

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.900 
by that and carefully then put your hand
underneath<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.489> so

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
underneath it like so

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.940 
underneath it like so
support<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:19.020> be<00:02:19.140> careful<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> corners

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
support it just be careful the corners

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.020 
support it just be careful the corners
you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.070> see<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.430> fishing<00:02:20.730> there<00:02:20.850> now<00:02:20.970> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
you can see the fishing there now and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
you can see the fishing there now and
they<00:02:21.180> naturally<00:02:21.570> go<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> corner<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
they naturally go to the corner and it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.840 
they naturally go to the corner and it
would<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.070> very<00:02:23.190> easy<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.580> make<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.820> mistake

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
would be very easy to make the mistake

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.280 
would be very easy to make the mistake
and<00:02:24.300> pick<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.630> by<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.170> actually

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and pick it up by that and actually

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.310 
and pick it up by that and actually
crush<00:02:25.680> some<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> fish<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:27.840> let's<00:02:28.020> just<00:02:28.200> be

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
crush some of the fish so let's just be

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.800 
crush some of the fish so let's just be
careful<00:02:28.650> when<00:02:28.740> we<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.600> okay<00:02:30.600> we're<00:02:30.780> just

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
careful when we do that okay we're just

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.180 
careful when we do that okay we're just
going<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.080> leave<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.260> float<00:02:31.620> now<00:02:31.830> for<00:02:32.040> about

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
going to leave that float now for about

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.710 
going to leave that float now for about
a<00:02:32.220> half<00:02:32.460> an<00:02:32.550> hour<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.970> make<00:02:33.360> sure<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.690> water
