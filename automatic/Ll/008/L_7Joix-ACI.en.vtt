00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.179
 do not 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.610
 how about friends how are you welcome to 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 mysteries discovered point is 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 today I bring you a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.370
 video or program that I think we're going to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.610
 rethink a little 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.059
 to train and sit down a bit and 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 meditate on what I am going to comment on 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.809
 this moment 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.540
 many know that in this channel of 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.369
 mysterious discovered we always put 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.759
 above the investigations the 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.490
 old texts and especially the texts 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.790
 from the bible 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.630
 but the funny thing when you enter 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 this 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.880
 a world of biblical 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.110
 where I know there are many skeptics 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 about the complete truthfulness 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.730
 apart from this this accumulation of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.880
 books called bible 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.020
 I enter certain 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.010
 stories 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.100
 certain 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.530
 modern stories also mixed with 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:11.470
 old stories 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:16.220
 and always try always try 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.490
 can always give an explanation to the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.720
 light 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:26.180
 in light of these texts 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.750
 and something curious that I read 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.360
 It was in the book 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.440
 of apocalypse in chapter 12 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.720
 verse 12 something that is mentioned 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:46.130
 as a warning not only for 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.660
 the inhabitants of the earth but to 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:55.090
 the inhabitants who live under the sea 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:59.290
 this appreciation maybe a little curious 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.799
 maybe a little mysterious 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.700
 it has led me to think has led me to 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:12.290
 investigate because inhabitants are mentioned 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.280
 under the oceans 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.870
 where are those cities 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 where with all our technology 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:27.520
 we can discover 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.310
 at least see mapped those cities 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.510
 under the sea 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.910
 we know that our planet has more 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.460
 oceans that land part 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.210
 but not only 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.120
 in this text but the stories as I have 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.220
 said old speak of cities under 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.780
 the sea 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.480
 of beings that live smart in the 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.489
 oceans 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.330
 but also modern stories we 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.299
 lead to those sightings 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.930
 sightings of technological devices or 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.810
 at least 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.190
 those objects 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:18.060
 unidentified sailors that many have 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:22.180
 reported and even lights lights 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.380
 quite powerful under the sea of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:30.400
 those that cross the oceans with 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.580
 your commercial aircraft 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:38.860
 it's funny what 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:42.960
 the same bible can comment can give 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.260
 clues of something that in other cultures 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:53.510
 inside the mythology 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.510
 those inhabitants of the oceans are spoken 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.810
 this is a mystery a mystery why 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:07.279
 if we go back to the old book of 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:09.599
 Enoch that talks about those 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:12.070
 genetic experiments that they did 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.290
 those watchers 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.470
 to human beings and not only to 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:22.060
 human beings but to all creatures 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:24.580
 living on this planet because maybe 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.090
 give us some clues maybe it's 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.840
 crazy, possibly crazy 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:34.240
 to think that this would come from there 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.639
 those dark times of those 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.319
 previous times to everything known 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.300
 but we have to leave a door 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:49.360
 open 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:53.560
 that when the bible mentions some 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.849
 some brushstrokes of stories 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.709
 of those mythologies 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:04.540
 mentioned in other texts is because 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:06.520
 something they should know 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.560
 curious 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:15.960
 curious the truth and very surprising that 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:21.069
 to me in this case he has left me then 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.249
 pretty and restless in thinking about 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.860
 try to see 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:29.590
 what 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.449
 part of the mythology mythology of the 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.430
 ancient texts of the stories of the 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:38.480
 civilizations 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:43.070
 they fully coincide 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:45.600
 and thinking this only makes me 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.790
 see what 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.550
 there is a connection 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:56.920
 a connection outside this planet 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:07:01.330
 some experiments carried out or at 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:04.180
 less something intentional against the race 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:10.440
 human and living creatures in this 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:14.430
 planet and that there is perhaps a war 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:19.409
 a war of powers surely outside 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:24.439
 of this planet for this planet earth 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:24.439
 and going back to the cities those cities 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:34.410
 their mythology can explain 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.410
 maybe those sightings 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:43.490
 those filming of 

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:46.280
 mermaids are true 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:49.610
 Maybe it's the moment when we 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.840
 we have to put the batteries and investigate 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.270
 in case we see 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.300
 thank you friends I wait for you here once 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.389
 more in mysterious exposed point 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.389
 is
