actually<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.900> stock<00:01:19.200> exhaust<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.550> much

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
actually a stock exhaust with that much

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.070 
actually a stock exhaust with that much
horsepower<00:01:21.120> you're<00:01:21.420> actually<00:01:21.720> gonna<00:01:21.840> get

some<00:01:22.380> noise<00:01:22.590> from<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.250> exhaust<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.970> think<00:01:24.390> my

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
some noise from the exhaust I think my

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.060 
some noise from the exhaust I think my
loudest<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:26.390> nine<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> almost<00:01:28.710> 92

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
loudest was about nine the almost 92

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
loudest was about nine the almost 92
decibels<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:30.060> right<00:01:30.240> under<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> limit<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
decibels I was right under the limit I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.360 
decibels I was right under the limit I
think<00:01:31.110> I'd<00:01:31.380> probably<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.040> bit<00:01:32.160> of

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
think I'd probably have a little bit of

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.820 
think I'd probably have a little bit of
an<00:01:32.460> advantage<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.960> C<00:01:34.110> 60<00:01:34.620> over

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
an advantage with the to C 60 over

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.230 
an advantage with the to C 60 over
something<00:01:35.190> like<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.370> Corvette<00:01:35.880> Grand<00:01:36.000> Sport

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.720 

the<00:03:06.499> main<00:03:06.680> thing<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:06.920> we<00:03:07.099> found<00:03:07.280> out<00:03:07.430> today

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the main thing that we found out today

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.080 
the main thing that we found out today
is<00:03:07.939> that<00:03:08.209> by<00:03:08.599> altering<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.349> track<00:03:09.799> and<00:03:10.159> by

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
is that by altering the track and by

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.140 
is that by altering the track and by
developing<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.109> chicane<00:03:12.650> right<00:03:13.639> at<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.909> point
