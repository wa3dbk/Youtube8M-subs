00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.150 
family there's a lot of that DNA
embedded<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.710> SUV<00:02:22.070> as<00:02:22.640> well<00:02:22.880> but<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:24.160> think

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
embedded in this SUV as well but I think

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.680 
embedded in this SUV as well but I think
somewhere<00:02:25.640> down<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> line<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.060> loses<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.570> bit

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
somewhere down the line it loses a bit

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.210 
somewhere down the line it loses a bit
of<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.870> character<00:02:27.260> I'm<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.410> big<00:02:27.680> fan<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.040> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
of that character I'm a big fan of the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.310 
of that character I'm a big fan of the
discovery<00:02:28.640> form<00:02:29.030> even<00:02:29.720> though<00:02:29.990> it's<00:02:30.140> got

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
discovery form even though it's got

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.290 
discovery form even though it's got
those<00:02:30.470> slab-sided<00:02:30.800> looks<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.580> very<00:02:31.610> squarish

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
those slab-sided looks a very squarish

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.140 
those slab-sided looks a very squarish
Redbox<00:02:32.990> styling<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.800> think<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.460> hte<00:02:34.880> has<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
Redbox styling I think that hte has a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.690 
Redbox styling I think that hte has a
lot<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.360> character<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.220> some<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.460> I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
lot of character and some of that I

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.730 
lot of character and some of that I
guess<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.150> lacking<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.080> stuff<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.410> sport

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
guess is lacking in the stuff you sport

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.860 
guess is lacking in the stuff you sport
I<00:02:39.830> would<00:02:40.010> have<00:02:40.190> wanted<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:41.090> SUV<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.600> have<00:02:41.720> its

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
I would have wanted this SUV to have its

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.590 
I would have wanted this SUV to have its
own<00:02:41.990> unique<00:02:42.440> character<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:44.360> is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
own unique character and that is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.960 
own unique character and that is
something<00:02:44.840> I'm<00:02:45.080> not<00:02:45.320> getting<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.040> see<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.730> this

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
something I'm not getting to see in this

situation now the Discovery sport on be
more<00:03:25.220> than<00:03:25.340> adequate<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:25.790> cable

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.630 

suspension<00:03:31.630> is<00:03:31.660> pretty<00:03:32.040> contemporary<00:03:33.040> for

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
suspension is pretty contemporary for

suspension is pretty contemporary for
the<00:03:33.730> discovery<00:03:34.180> sport<00:03:34.560> definitely<00:03:35.560> better

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
the discovery sport definitely better

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.640 
the discovery sport definitely better
than<00:03:35.890> what<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> Freelander<00:03:36.760> offered<00:03:37.650> it's

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
than what the Freelander offered it's

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.740 
than what the Freelander offered it's
got<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.860> multi-link<00:03:39.280> rear<00:03:39.459> axle<00:03:40.030> with<00:03:40.360> quite<00:03:40.720> a

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
got a multi-link rear axle with quite a

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.540 
got a multi-link rear axle with quite a
bit<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.959> aluminium<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.890> construction

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
bit of aluminium in the construction

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.420 
bit of aluminium in the construction
we've<00:03:43.239> got<00:03:43.420> magnetic<00:03:43.900> dampers<00:03:44.319> as<00:03:44.500> well<00:03:44.709> which

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
we've got magnetic dampers as well which

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.570 
we've got magnetic dampers as well which
provide<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.330> flat<00:03:46.810> even<00:03:47.680> ride<00:03:47.920> quality<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.520> of

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
provide a flat even ride quality and of

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.960 
provide a flat even ride quality and of
course<00:03:48.760> better<00:03:48.970> improved<00:03:49.959> dynamic<00:03:50.500> abilities

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
course better improved dynamic abilities

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.550 
course better improved dynamic abilities
now<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.030> magnetic<00:03:52.330> dampers<00:03:52.870> effectively<00:03:53.380> use

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
now the magnetic dampers effectively use

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.190 
now the magnetic dampers effectively use
the<00:03:53.770> magnetic<00:03:54.190> field<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.940> stiffen<00:03:55.390> now<00:03:55.660> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
the magnetic field to stiffen now the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.979 
the magnetic field to stiffen now the
damping<00:03:56.670> properties<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.300> that's<00:03:58.510> what<00:03:58.780> leads

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
damping properties so that's what leads

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.530 
damping properties so that's what leads
to<00:03:59.170> better<00:03:59.290> ride<00:03:59.980> quality<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.790> course<00:04:01.060> it

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
to better ride quality and of course it

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.470 
to better ride quality and of course it
adjusts<00:04:02.110> itself<00:04:02.470> depending<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:04.300> the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
adjusts itself depending on the

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.330 
adjusts itself depending on the
conditions<00:04:05.050> or<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.769> terrain<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.190> you're

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
conditions or the terrain that you're

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:17.009 
conditions or the terrain that you're
driving<00:04:06.670> on

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.920 

this<00:04:18.019> curvy<00:04:18.200> spot<00:04:18.530> also<00:04:18.799> gets<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.430> Haldex

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
this curvy spot also gets a Haldex

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.240 
this curvy spot also gets a Haldex
differential<00:04:20.930> with<00:04:21.829> full-time

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
the option of an active driveline but

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.800 
the option of an active driveline but
I'm<00:04:28.280> not<00:04:28.460> sure<00:04:28.730> at<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.090> point<00:04:29.150> in<00:04:29.480> time<00:04:29.600> if

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
I'm not sure at this point in time if

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.170 
I'm not sure at this point in time if
that's<00:04:30.020> what's<00:04:30.350> coming<00:04:30.580> for<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.940> indian

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
that's what's coming for the indian

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.850 
that's what's coming for the indian
market<00:04:32.510> as<00:04:32.600> well<00:04:32.780> but<00:04:33.050> what<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.410> active
