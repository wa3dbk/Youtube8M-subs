00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.080
 Okay, so we all know that person 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.800
 who, every time you say something, 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.940
 so from "Actually, technically speaking, tomatoes are not vegetables!" 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.860
 And ... I ... before we do this episode, 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.120
 I want to encourage you not to be that person. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.260
 But knowing the actual layout of the things we eat 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.620
 You can tell a lot about where fruits and vegetables 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.100
 and how they are developed. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.820
 So it's pretty interesting 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.080
 just don't use it to be an insufferable scholar. 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.540
 For example, officially speaking, 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.340
 Everything that is a root, stem or leaf of a plant 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.980
 qualifies as a vegetable. 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 which means some things you might normal 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 when looking at fruit is actually a vegetable. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740
 We see rhubarb as, for example 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.120
 a kind of fruity thing, because 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 it is in cake and tastes so sweet 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.760
 but it is the stem of a plant, so it is a vegetable. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.000
 Vegetable pie ... who thought of that? 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420
 Corn, zucchini and green beans, on the other hand 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.420
 are all fruits, and tomatoes too. 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.020
 That's because these foods don't 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.340
 roots, stems or leaves. 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.620
 They are egg bags. 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.340
 Hopefully you don't feel too weird now. 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.820
 So yes, fruits are the egg bags of a flowering plant 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.980
 that develop after the seeds are fertilized 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.960
 or, sometimes, after they are activated to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.100
 develop without fertilization. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.440
 From the perspective of the plant, surrounded by its seeds 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680
 with something soft and juicy and tasty 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920
 increases the chance that those seeds will be eaten 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.020
 and then spread in beautiful fertile 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.160
 poop poops. 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.360
 So broccoli and cauliflower are not fruit 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
 even though they are flower buds because they are unopened 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.900
 the flower has not changed. 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.780
 Real fruits come in many different types 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.460
 and some of them are perfect for an anatomy lesson 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.160
 An important factor for botanists in categorizing fruit 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.220
 is how many fruiting principles the flower had. 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.820
 So berries are by definition fruits that come 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.320
 of one fruiting principle with several seeds. 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.640
 That makes grapes, bananas, peppers and tomatoes 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.700
 all different kinds of berries. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 So hold on to your pants because raspberries 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 and blackberries are something completely different 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.680
 They are called aggregate fruits 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.040
 a whole bunch of small fruits grouped. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.900
 And strawberries are not berries either 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.980
 In fact, the tasty red portion of the strawberry is not 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.880
 once a fruit. It is a special kind of plant structure 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580
 called a fleshy soil. 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.780
 You actually have to look much closer to the fruit soil 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.800
 to see the fruit called achenes. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.420
 They are dry, single-seeded speckles 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.920
 the red surface of the strawberry 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.400
 Sunflowers produce other achene that you probably have 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 knows as sunflower seeds. 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.560
 Nuts are also fruits and their bowls are coats 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 developed from the egg sack wall. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.520
 That also applies to things like chestnuts and hazelnuts 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.980
 But technically, walnuts and pecans are not nuts, 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.320
 along with other egg bag fruits such as peaches and 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.620
 and plums and coconuts, they are called stone fruits. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.560
 Stone fruit has only one seed with clear skin, 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.840
 that covers a fleshy middle layer. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.420
 In a stone fruit, the inner layer is often called stony, 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.860
 and if you ever accidentally chewed on a peach seed, 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.060
 do you understand why. 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 Now if you want to work with your botanical terminology 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.260
 raspberries and blackberries are specific 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.740
 aggregate of stone fruit and every small part is called a druplet. 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.800
 But many fruits are more than just a matured ovary flower. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.260
 Take pome fruits, for example, apples and pears. 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.300
 Zip fruits are known as accessory fruits because 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.560
 There is so much more going on in them than a simple egg sack. 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800
 The egg bag only makes the core of the fruit. 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.280
 The flesh of the fruit have actually changed 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.720
 petals and sepals, the flower parts that cover a bud 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.040
 leaving the knumpy fruit soil at the base of the flower. 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.640
 And when you eat hesperidium fruit 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 You also get a mouthful of the unexpected. 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.120
 This category includes fruits with hard crust 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.560
 and few partition walls, such as lemons and grapefruits 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.460
 and oranges. It turns out that the little one is packed 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.560
 juicy pieces in each section called juice bags, 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.220
 once small hairy cells were on the inside of the egg bag 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.300
 but they filled themselves with goodness when the fruit ripened. 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.480
 So the next time you drink a glass of gravy 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.620
 Enjoy your mouth full of fruit hair.
