00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.750
 i 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.340
 ah 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.410
 4 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.310
 inei voices 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.130
 she is very sexy 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.570
 what is a salt 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 safari 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.990
 To make this necklace first 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.990
 we measure the neck and the length that 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.630
 we want the necklace then helping us 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.480
 We measure a tape measure and with the 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.040
 pliers remove the hooks so that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 is the appropriate length 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 for the placement of the pearls what 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 let's do it with the pin 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 we introduce the pearl inside the pin 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 and the gesture that we are going to make once 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.540
 pin inside the chain is going to be 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.280
 this one with what I teach outside the chain 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.280
 so you can see how it would look 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.880
 we are going to place the pearl in the chain 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.540
 for that we put the pearl on the pin 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.220
 then we cut because these pins 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.500
 that I have bought are quite long 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.510
 then how did I stay a little 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 long I have been cutting one by one 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.780
 but you can buy shorter pins 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 then we put it inside one of the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.780
 links of the chain and we are doing the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.770
 spin that today have been taught before and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.770
 we are closing 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.070
 you want 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.640
 yes 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.120
 we will perform this procedure 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.270
 with all the pearls and we are going to put 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.220
 the thickness that we want to the collar 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.370
 we are getting the pearl in the 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.340
 pin always try to stay until 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.789
 the end the peel we are cutting the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.789
 pin 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.920
 we introduce it in one of the links 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.920
 of the chain 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.280
 a sermon 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.470
 and with the round- nose pliers we're going 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.290
 making that little hitch that is what 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.670
 that will help us so that the pearls will 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 fasten well to the chain 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.190
 you have to arm us with patience because 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.740
 this necklace when wearing so much pearl are 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.920
 many many hooks what we have 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920
 what to do 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.250
 let's put the necklace so many pearls 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.920
 as we want so one by one we go 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.280
 doing the same procedure poke in 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.969
 the pin cut the pin and hook 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.969
 to the chain 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.700
 for the length of the pins we are going to 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.870
 go see as we are staying and 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.730
 How we like to keep the necklace 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.400
 I've put it two or three 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.070
 centimeters but I did not have a 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.850
 fixed measurement and goes more or less calculating 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.630
 and seeing 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.310
 it is not the same 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.690
 another line 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.690
 she is very sexy 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.470
 alvarito 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.890
 in haro 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.050
 as he has been making the necklace 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.280
 I will find some 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.280
 difficulties for example 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.580
 when the pins are bent and not 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.910
 They fit well into the pearls before 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.970
 double what we use 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.010
 the flat-nose pliers to put them 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.910
 straight and get screwed 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.550
 before our 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.240
 also if we lend a lot the necklace 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.610
 pearls and we put it very tense this can 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.070
 that does not cause the chain to break 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.630
 half of the process and it's a job that 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.190
 they begin to roll all the pearls and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.530
 because afterwards to hook is not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.170
 much more complicated but if the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.090
 chain what you can use is a 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.490
 pin as a link you can also join 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.970
 the chain on links or you can 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.340
 use a metal washer I had 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.380
 metal washers at home and I've been 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.830
 broken twice and twice have I had to 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.830
 join in there 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.420
 it broke at the beginning but it takes 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.980
 a trick so that it would not break in 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.980
 During all the process 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.499
 there is a way that never breaks and 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.150
 is that when you start making the necklace 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.610
 what you have to do is go 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.380
 hooking along the entire chain 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.840
 the bitches 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.570
 but you have to be occupying that 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.400
 one side is super full you have to go 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.980
 hooking along the entire chain 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.470
 and in the holes that are left 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.470
 you are hooking the pearls 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.920
 the idea would be to hook the pearls 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.530
 throughout the necklace leaving them 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.720
 loose and then in the games that you 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.060
 they are going to go getting of pearls 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.670
 until you get more or less the density 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.370
 What do you want anyway? 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.820
 I advise a lot of density because you can 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.820
 split 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.960
 modern 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.960
 and not 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.240
 from aragua 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.230
 once we have finished it 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.630
 we put a small carabiner at the end 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.770
 from the end of one of the chains that 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.770
 will serve us as closure 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.070
 ah 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.070
