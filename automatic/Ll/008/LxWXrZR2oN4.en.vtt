let's<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:41.790> distill<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
let's not distill it you see so this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.799 
let's not distill it you see so this
recipe<00:00:46.289> calls<00:00:46.620> for<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:48.000> make<00:00:48.210> six<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> half

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
recipe calls for to make six and a half

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
recipe calls for to make six and a half
in<00:00:49.140> galleries<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.309> only<00:00:50.460> gonna<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
in galleries but I'm only gonna do a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
in galleries but I'm only gonna do a
half<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.210> gallon<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.780> look<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
half a gallon you go look this is just a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.160 
half a gallon you go look this is just a
trial<00:00:53.329> I'm<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.539> gonna<00:00:54.750> try<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.020> out<00:00:55.670> I

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
trial I'm just gonna try this out I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.039 
trial I'm just gonna try this out I
think<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.320> code<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.859> 12<00:00:59.449> pounds<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.390> 12

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
think it code for 12 pounds it did 12

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.940 
think it code for 12 pounds it did 12
pounds<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:05.420> brown<00:01:06.420> sugar<00:01:08.930> full<00:01:09.930> jar<00:01:10.320> grandma's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pounds of brown sugar full jar grandma's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.679 
pounds of brown sugar full jar grandma's
molasses<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.299> regular

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
molasses or you know just regular

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.140 
molasses or you know just regular
molasses<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:14.250> long<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.409> not<00:01:16.409> sulfur

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
molasses as long as it's not not sulfur

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.760 
molasses as long as it's not not sulfur
molasses<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> course<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.890> yeast<00:01:21.740> what<00:01:22.740> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
molasses and of course some yeast what I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.999 
molasses and of course some yeast what I
did<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.189> put<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.430> quarter<00:01:23.909> cup<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> brown<00:01:24.720> sugar

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
did I put a quarter cup of brown sugar

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.609 
did I put a quarter cup of brown sugar
and<00:01:26.009> open<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:27.090> yeast<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:28.049> used<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and open my yeast up but I only used a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
and open my yeast up but I only used a
quarter<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> pack<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.180> yeast<00:01:33.140> 1/2<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
quarter of the pack of yeast 1/2 a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
quarter of the pack of yeast 1/2 a
gallon<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.150> trial<00:01:38.299> and

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
gallon just see it's just a trial and

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.410 
gallon just see it's just a trial and
it's<00:01:39.659> bubbling<00:01:40.110> fun<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.640> lot<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.000> videos

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it's bubbling fun I know a lot of videos

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.840 
it's bubbling fun I know a lot of videos
are<00:01:42.750> I've<00:01:43.500> said<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.460> time<00:01:44.670> again

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
are I've said this time and time again

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
are I've said this time and time again
they're<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.479> pulling<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> dried<00:01:46.320> yeast

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
they're just pulling the dried yeast

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.179 
they're just pulling the dried yeast
right<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.979> no-no

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
right in it but that's that's a no-no

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
right in it but that's that's a no-no
you<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.180> packs<00:01:51.540> any<00:01:51.780> good

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you don't know if that packs any good

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
you don't know if that packs any good
just<00:01:52.320> cause<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.920> date<00:01:53.159> does<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.610> mean

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
just cause it's in date does not mean

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330 
just cause it's in date does not mean
it's<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> activate<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
it's any good you need to activate it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.840 
it's any good you need to activate it
was

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
was

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.899 
was
very<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.950> first<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> do

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
very more so first what I'm going to do

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.530 
very more so first what I'm going to do
is<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.450> got<00:02:00.720> my<00:02:01.110> water<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:05.670> test<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.150> pH

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
is I got my water and then test the pH

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.760 
is I got my water and then test the pH
in<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.830> using<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.250> simple<00:02:08.850> swimming<00:02:09.539> pool<00:02:09.780> pH

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
in I'm using a simple swimming pool pH

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.260 
in I'm using a simple swimming pool pH
tester<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.270> see<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> pH<00:02:12.989> is<00:02:13.830> ideal<00:02:14.640> it's

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
tester you can see the pH is ideal it's

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.900 
tester you can see the pH is ideal it's
perfect<00:02:18.260> if<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.500> wasn't<00:02:19.739> perfect<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.760> was

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
perfect if it wasn't perfect if it was

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.320 
perfect if it wasn't perfect if it was
high<00:02:21.150> I've<00:02:21.600> had<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.989> bowl<00:02:22.260> at<00:02:22.470> some<00:02:22.650> moment

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
high I've had to bowl at some moment

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.150 
high I've had to bowl at some moment
lancet<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.930> right<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:25.319> this<00:02:25.530> waters<00:02:25.980> about

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
lancet so right now this waters about

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:45.920 
lancet so right now this waters about
nine<00:02:26.459> areas<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:44.209> quarter<00:02:45.209> cup<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
nine areas you see this quarter cup of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.070 
nine areas you see this quarter cup of
