for<00:01:43.140> quite<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> while<00:01:43.590> because<00:01:44.070> there's<00:01:44.310> no

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
for quite a while because there's no

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.450

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
well.one there's no revenue really on

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
well.one there's no revenue really on
this<00:01:47.579> channel<00:01:47.850> there's<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
this channel there's just really not a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.300 
this channel there's just really not a
lot<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> extra<00:01:49.380> revenue<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.250> thought

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
lot of extra revenue and I just thought

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.190 
lot of extra revenue and I just thought
that<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.790> know<00:01:50.939> how<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.240> oh<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> did

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that I don't know how I oh there you did

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I was like I don't know how I didn't die

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
I was like I don't know how I didn't die
right<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.540> was<00:01:54.659> called<00:01:54.869> mr.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
your face anyway they usually spawn down

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.540 
your face anyway they usually spawn down
an<00:05:31.140> a<00:05:31.320> but<00:05:31.560> my<00:05:31.680> team<00:05:31.830> was<00:05:31.950> kind<00:05:32.070> of<00:05:32.160> moving<00:05:32.400> down

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
an a but my team was kind of moving down

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.980 
an a but my team was kind of moving down

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
there so I'm like trying to figure out

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.480 
there so I'm like trying to figure out
where<00:05:34.170> they're<00:05:34.290> at<00:05:34.320> it's<00:05:35.040> not<00:05:35.160> one<00:05:35.340> guy<00:05:35.460> over

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
where they're at it's not one guy over

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.650 
where they're at it's not one guy over
there<00:05:35.790> and<00:05:35.910> now<00:05:35.970> they're<00:05:36.120> spawning<00:05:36.360> over<00:05:36.570> the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
there and now they're spawning over the

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.310 
there and now they're spawning over the
side<00:05:36.900> by<00:05:37.110> the<00:05:37.190> tanker<00:05:38.190> over<00:05:38.940> here<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.480> now

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
side by the tanker over here and now

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.110 
side by the tanker over here and now
there's<00:05:40.530> spawn<00:05:40.680> them<00:05:40.800> back<00:05:40.950> in<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:41.610> luckily

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
there's spawn them back in a so luckily

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.000 
there's spawn them back in a so luckily
that<00:05:42.360> guy<00:05:42.480> got<00:05:42.600> cleared<00:05:42.870> out<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.170> way<00:05:43.230> but

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
that guy got cleared out of the way but

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.130 
that guy got cleared out of the way but
that<00:05:44.040> a<00:05:44.160> spot<00:05:44.640> is<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.910> best<00:05:45.150> spot<00:05:45.660> usually<00:05:45.870> if

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
that a spot is the best spot usually if

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.470 
that a spot is the best spot usually if
they<00:05:46.260> can<00:05:46.440> spawn<00:05:46.800> down<00:05:47.070> right<00:05:47.250> there<00:05:47.490> downside

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
they can spawn down right there downside

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.210 
they can spawn down right there downside
is<00:05:48.570> when<00:05:48.660> the<00:05:48.750> ac-130<00:05:49.260> kind<00:05:49.530> of<00:05:49.620> rotates<00:05:50.040> it

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
is when the ac-130 kind of rotates it

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.890 
is when the ac-130 kind of rotates it
kind<00:05:50.580> of<00:05:50.640> can<00:05:50.820> get<00:05:51.000> tricky<00:05:51.150> but<00:05:51.480> it<00:05:51.630> was<00:05:51.750> a<00:05:51.780> nice

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
kind of can get tricky but it was a nice

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.540 
kind of can get tricky but it was a nice
little<00:05:52.020> quad<00:05:52.320> right<00:05:52.530> there<00:05:52.710> didn't<00:05:53.430> get

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
little quad right there didn't get

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.210 
little quad right there didn't get
enough<00:05:53.790> in<00:05:54.000> my<00:05:54.120> ac-130<00:05:54.780> oh<00:05:55.080> yes<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.650> did<00:05:55.800> there
