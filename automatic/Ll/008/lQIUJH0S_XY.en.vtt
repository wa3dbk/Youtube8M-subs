the<00:01:31.140> job<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> leader<00:01:32.340> uh<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.570> do

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the job you got to be the leader uh I do

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.270 
the job you got to be the leader uh I do
