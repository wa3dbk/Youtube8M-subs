in<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:32.690> ground<00:01:32.900> here<00:01:33.170> I'll<00:01:33.350> play<00:01:33.560> some

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
in the ground here I'll play some

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.600 
in the ground here I'll play some
netherrack<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.550> ignite<00:01:35.950> that's<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.220> basic

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
netherrack and ignite that's the basic

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.650 
netherrack and ignite that's the basic
brick<00:01:37.880> barbecue<00:01:38.150> design<00:01:43.180> we<00:01:44.180> can<00:01:44.270> change<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
brick barbecue design we can change the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.359 
brick barbecue design we can change the
blocks<00:01:44.900> along<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.259> back<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.650> barbecue<00:01:46.130> of

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
blocks along the back of the barbecue of

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.520 
blocks along the back of the barbecue of
different<00:01:46.789> styles

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.710 

experiment<00:01:51.530> with<00:01:51.590> different<00:01:51.740> blocks<00:01:52.160> and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
experiment with different blocks and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:02.250 
experiment with different blocks and
find<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.840> style<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.320> like

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.500 

now<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.590> also<00:02:03.740> use<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.340> furnace<00:02:04.910> in<00:02:05.150> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
now you can also use a furnace in the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.430 
now you can also use a furnace in the
design<00:02:05.840> as<00:02:06.740> I'll<00:02:06.980> make<00:02:07.220> here<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.060> same<00:02:08.600> shape

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
design as I'll make here so same shape

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.910 
design as I'll make here so same shape
as<00:02:09.710> before<00:02:10.190> using<00:02:10.460> stone<00:02:10.850> bricks<00:02:11.710> put<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:12.800> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
as before using stone bricks put in the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.520 
as before using stone bricks put in the
furnace<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.810> I'll<00:02:14.810> place<00:02:15.050> some<00:02:15.080> wooden

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.640 

and<00:02:32.299> now<00:02:32.450> I'll<00:02:32.629> make<00:02:32.840> two<00:02:33.080> simple<00:02:33.470> barbecue

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
and now I'll make two simple barbecue

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.589 
and now I'll make two simple barbecue
designs<00:02:34.189> the<00:02:34.519> first<00:02:34.760> one<00:02:34.939> is<00:02:35.060> more<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.420> an
