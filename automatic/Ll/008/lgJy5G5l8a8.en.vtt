 will show you all the killstreaks 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.410
 special from each map so sealed 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.540
 that she likes to be unlocked with the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.610
 blue suitcase so a little reminder for 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.590

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.150

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.570
 so on the ground either to form years in 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.700
 the map 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.750
 if a person does not take it then you 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.250
 see that when you go to take the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.140
 blue suitcase you will have a challenge to do 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 so tic he leaves behind or what and to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.780
 every time that will give you the package and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.769
 you throw away the package if you have the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.540
 luck you have which m 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.739
 so for the first map that is the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.449
 flagship brand aoki and the map in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 Egypt simply what this 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.990
 will be something that will go a little bit 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.760
 help play so that's going to give the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.020
 specialist bonus so but really 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.550
 all the specialists bonus you have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
 all the assets of the game instantly 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.100
 you see that it's really stylish to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.900
 left and right you have little ones 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.430
 signs also a little music that you 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.690
 help to play good that's enough 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.210
 stylish to have all the assets like that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.440
 still w3 it reminds a little the mode 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.970
 call of specialization 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.670
 we will continue with the amap des parts 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.110
 help which is the mexican map so bac 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.110
 when you unlock which m 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 you will see that you will become 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.140
 how he already says marashi the marashi 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.549
 of death where I do not know what and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.350
 so you have acquired words and a 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.939
 pretty stylish outfit you really run 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.619
 quickly it reminds a little the predator but 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.420
 far can change or when you 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.950
 michael myers also only send you 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.689
 run you have akimbo as soon as 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.340
 you kill an enemy you have a clone 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.930
 of you who appears knowing that you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.700
 can have two clubs of you in 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.320
 the maximum amap six unknown dies on 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 could have received to the enemy and sarah will do 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.560
 to appear a claude so it's really 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.460
 big massacre in a wise advise you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 to try to do it because that's 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.000
 really if we will continue after 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.609
 with the next map which is the map one 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.060
 mutiny which is she the city map 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.729
 ghost 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.950
 so this is a map a bit of hacker so 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.899
 on this map the mutineer there are two clis 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.890
 special rick so that's what makes the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.870
 power of the brand so there is 1 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 really stylish and here we are ready 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.110
 so well the first one that's going to be the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.790
 pirate ship so like that they 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 call the barrage of cannon all 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 just at the beginning I have not found much 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.630
 so I put a little accelerated for myself 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.250
 go to the place because you have to 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.050
 go to the edge of the map to be able to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.800
 see the pirate ship and so you 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.090
 go see a pirate ship 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.680
 simply that they shoot bullets 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.420
 cannon all over the map so we see there 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.709
 at the beginning I struggled a little finally 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.420
 I managed to find you see well 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.220
 that the ja the boat and that pulls 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.570
 cannonballs 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.760
 it's not exceptional it's enough 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.960
 funny what's that so it's not too much 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.430
 kills you'll see that it'll finish 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.410
 by the gentleman to France I know more 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.030
 if I show them and finally the short one 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.810
 second that special strict of the map 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.920
 it's going to be ghosts so you have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.060
 it depends on the times you have him 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.530
 time you have the other me personally I 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.660
 once made him one another and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.550
 you are going to see you are going to have some 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.710
 ghosts two ghosts wholesale who are going 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.810
 who go in the map and kill the enemies 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.560
 it reminds of an alien loan on the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.910
 dome remake 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.260
 so you're going to see that from 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.280
 after which the two ghosts that are 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.709
 pose the same and a little music 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.030
 style and I do not know if we'll hear it and 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.900
 so we see the ghosts who are walking around 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.270
 a little bit in the language so that's 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 really once again very stylish and 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.500
 for the last law maybe the map 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.060
 favelas and so the special thing is going 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.920
 to be just the same c that's it 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.970
 really stylish at first I looked for a 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.780
 little in the classes if we could the 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.890
 put but can not put it in 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.830
 the class is really a special thing 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.350
 for favelas so it's pretty stylish but 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.760
 so that's while the strict clip 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.780
 special this tablecloth ends me 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.459
 I will invite you to go and make a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.230
 turn on my channel on my channel you 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.940
 will find a lot of videos from 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.350
 dlc all week besides I 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.700
 thanks claude was made to contribute if 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.170
 the furniture at that makes me super fun 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.220
 and so here on machine you will find 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.900
 a lot of videos on call of duty 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.280
 basically on the kid's dlc 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.580
 it's true there will be ten 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.800
 videos 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.880
 so if you have not much to 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.530
 do and you 're good videos 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.450
 of lunel sebha city and on my chair 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.920
 legal set to tell you and so that's it 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.820
 ends up with favelas so a law can 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.380
 bitterly I'm happy with the 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.330
 find her is really beautiful and 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.709
 so we see his laces center no 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.060
 that they call it the y 8 I believe 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.320
 only send when you put it 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.930
 simply you are in the season where 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.560
 we drink there is I think where they reject 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.090
 we do not care 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.950
 so that's exactly the season in 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.090
 cornwall excellently well done I 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.690
 find it pretty stylish that put back 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.640
 stuff like that 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.590
 so again I repeat it the 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.060
 part the killstreaks were shown 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.190
 partly private which against the bots 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.600
 so do not deal with booster or what 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.280
 here I wanted to show you this the most 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.720
 quickly possible because online 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.070
 it's pretty funny to unlock but on 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.450
 the personal channel I'm showing you would 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 all the special districts but in 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.720
 line and all that removes comments and 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.310
 so if you want to see this do not hesitate 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.850
 not to take a ride on my channel I 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.850
 thanks again
