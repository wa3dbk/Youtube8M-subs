00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.529
 so friends may welcome you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hot little special episode today in the 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 fifa 5 10 ultimate team that has one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.900
 simple reason louis so it was now 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.110
 finally in pécs in it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 25 10 because when his heavy finally 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.870
 dissolved in air 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 and now he must play for his 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 new club fc barcelona and that have 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.720
 I just took a look at the occasion 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.760
 to see if he has already appeared 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 is on the transfer list 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 and of course the answer is us 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.710
 18 million is already here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 quite neat was his hand lift 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 is we look times shortly after the map 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.050
 is super weak foot 4 stars schmidt 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.690
 same four stars 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.129
 I almost watch it for six 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 Of course, everything on an 80 is not allowed 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.219
 He is a striker 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.989
 So that's really crazy 89 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.550
 in the overall assessment you 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.899
 Just in front of the front with benzema 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.719
 to have a storm together 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.750
 So I think then it burns 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 decent tree yes a sunny 1000 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.649
 I have a few crushed coins 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.329
 means we can theoretically 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.399
 open two big and two small max 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 here first out opponents differently 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.920
 of course until today's team of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.140
 week 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.790
 these are ordinary in there with diego 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.150
 godín we have leighton baines behind 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.010
 in it 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.740
 then we have the central midfield 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.979
 philipp lame we have wesley in front 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.220
 sneijder very happy and also rossi kalle 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.450
 Rahn from ssc Naples in it 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 agüero can be compared nicely 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.990
 with suarez a weak foot 4 stars 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.970
 schmidt himself against four stars exactly 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.060
 the same tempo shot is natural 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.020
 Madness in dribbling 90 So that will 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.119
 certainly a little something 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.820
 then we have to go with that goal 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.680
 we in the form of kagawa the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.780
 namesake for this series is sets 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 look at 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 I want to go for sure first and number 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 Although in the romo sets up look ob 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.579
 not in which 15,000 or whatever 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.009
 No , it's not interesting 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.869
 For us, we look at these sets 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.350
 So two big ones came to smaller ones 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.950
 then 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:57.820
 tim howard on top of what he has for 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.760
 us the man with beard and bald 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.650
 rahimi breaks away from the fog of the fc 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.070
 porto still has the ex-schalker and obama 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.509
 raphael rafael is awesome who fits 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.720
 namely perfect as a right-back 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.640
 william's live cams freestyle league bank 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 um mx from mexico league new not 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.180
 absolutely so interesting what else 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.750
 Of course we can have contracts like that 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 still in the process 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.940
 that's not so bad i always have 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.130
 whining that we have this player 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.200
 on the right position is better s 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.760
 no more the case is not bad 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.280
 what is speeding up again 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 also have the fixed values ​​of the 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.260
 defensive evaluation genuine usable and 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.959
 Now we have a crisis on the front 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.410
 if you think of lego what he brings us 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.850
 with raphael varane super that is 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.040
 Fierce per head through the one like 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.350
 many players have seven pieces on it 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.790
 the number aquilani columbo also fits 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.470
 good the bremer lee connection of yours 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.800
 Middle Rhine market video not necessarily 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.480
 the haiti had been nicer 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.780
 why jersey still fit asamoah 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.890
 by juventus turin left midfielder 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.930
 genie how you could install it 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.310
 that could be the connection with 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.040
 Gasoline for the front we still need 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.709
 a central midfield of the league of 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.989
 comics and mitroglou from olympiakos 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.670
 greece so that was worth it 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.890
 is only three chemistry styles left 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.530
 third goalkeeper handlebar and sentinel and 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.989
 leipzig as a coat of arms as if fifa knew 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.720
 what I am active in manager organizer 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.830
 Let's briefly as the easter egg 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.810
 just have to be short 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.480
 I have a comment I should get 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.400
 to activate hamburg coat of arms 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.860
 but I have the misfortune if one 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.700
 that's when you make the favorite flowers 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.590
 yes Grießmann would have we again 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.580
 for this a gold but however 5000 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.760
 These are the ones that are always given 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.920
 you get this one per week this 40 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.630
 altogether from the old with thematic 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.239
 Search is also coming 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.739
 he does it extra here it is from 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.480
 Names fit here are unfortunately the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.230
 false soares namely a spanish 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.760
 her mandy from madrid mourinho from 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.799
 Naples detail still as a chemistry style 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.049
 and Colombia as a wait is no coat of arms 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.160
 the flag is the camp freestyle you 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.430
 are currently very uninteresting 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.049
 because 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.209
 with us one on a full chemistry comes 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.390
 and then I will not be full either 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.400
 logically total needs to be maxed out 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.989
 But I say that I like it a lot 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.120
 So has opened these three change 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.949
 have something meaningful for everyone 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.060
 in it 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.820
 Of course, I am the big one about that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.650
 we got the raffael there 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.000
 I was asked to show yours too 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.410
 best lists and I can do that now 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.360
 like to connect here in this beautiful 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.389
 follow this little teeny little one here 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.009
 luis suarez special series we are me 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.600
 Madness what many of you already here 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.280
 I saved money on coins 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.919
 certainly right down here 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.360
 but on 31 52 1547 the number which the 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.250
 look worse but that's all 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.270
 easy to make out because they have 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.800
 probably not yet played or 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.349
 very little jekimov continues transfererlös 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.099
 vereins about I think are full 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.110
 47 million 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.240
 just that done write me 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.550
 that's pure that's really crazy 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.919
 that's almost twice as much as that 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.810
 second I do not want to know where I am 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.190
 I'm not that far down eleven 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.349
 I would not have expected millions now 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
 is it because we are in shape but of the 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.590
 caravan is in shape because I do not know 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.169
 as it is with those with the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.630
 million here these coins should also 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.909
 Logically millions are already called 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.650
 now the boys still no club the 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:30.570
 top team 183 with 210 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.310
 that's neat and that will be 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.690
 collapse from chemistry faith 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.860
 me and then the team strength 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.050
 is back we would not have all 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.150
 It must be far below 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:44.000
 no chemistry at all we have nothing at all 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.130
 35 277 is better than I expected 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.570
 107 70 I would not have thought now 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.180
 that would really come with it 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.710
 where we're at it, the player 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.419
 statistics is very nice and was 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.830
 not meaningful but we look 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.630
 First of all here I have to coat it 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.880
 Get away before a few more 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.740
 rowdy come to you and me 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.419
 Negatively attack the fun of course 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.259
 but what do you have for that you have to 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.240
 Of course, sometimes change 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:10.159
 Bascule bridge I like Belgium very well 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:14.550
 Are you company with that? 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:16.289
 I have just the best lists 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.599
 addressed the player statistic who 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.870
 but also nice to know that 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.879
 watch as well 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.080
 saskia 24 unfortunately that will be 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:26.870
 to have been last 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:32.150
 kaka benzema these are the 24 games 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.650
 until now and the gates benzema 17 times 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.759
 hit in 24 games that does not look 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.159
 bad he is of course ours 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.750
 strongest card with an 85 if one 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.939
 the values ​​you do not watch 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.710
 Despising goal templates Kaka was at the age of ten 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.810
 a total of nine goals were shot and fired 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.789
 play this is the maestro we him 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.110
 want to have and to us, too 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.430
 through this series to end 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.669
 league one, of course, at best 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.960
 accompany well I guess that 's it 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.400
 for this people I hope you have it 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.599
 Unfortunately they have no luis 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.650
 pulled suarez or could times 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.500
 look if you are lucky 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.210
 had a chance to get hold of it and yes it did 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.699
 We're in league nine 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.039
 want to relegate league and I hope that 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.400
 you're saying goodbye to me 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.479
 today 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.479
 Pauli is doing well
