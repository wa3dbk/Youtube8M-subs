00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.719
 hi friends, how are you doing a long time ago 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.680
 we see ourselves true and I can tell you that 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.690
 taking advantage of these are the 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.460
 seasons where we receive our 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 money from tax returns 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.450
 I want to tell you some little things about 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.369
 what have I planned to do then I want 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.340
 that they accompany me to do it now 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.439
 It makes money we've decided we have 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 seen some options then we have 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.390
 the priority of starting to build 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 our house in ecuador and that has us 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.770
 very very happy when I'm in Ecuador 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.780

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.019
 dollars from the start kit that is that you 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.640

 dollars according to your needs 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.379
