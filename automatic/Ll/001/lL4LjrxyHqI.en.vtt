00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.499
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.220
 6 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 m 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.349
 that's why the others 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.349
 m 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.650
 m 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.700
 five others 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.520
 2 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.650
 veiled sune in the usa 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.900
 the sports saga the fc has a long history in countries like 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.800
 United States 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.559
 and yet 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.730
 it is only the second version that arrives in France 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.790
 after ufc undisputed site 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.070
 that we offer this same version 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 practically what we offered the first version 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.870
 that is, the game is not recommended 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.070
 ufc 2010 brilliantly takes over from its predecessor and continues to 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 refine your product to perfection 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.810
 we can even consider that this game is part of the best fighting games 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 from the moment 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.150
 there is little change in 2007 control 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.340
 more than innovation we have to talk about small adjustments that change 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.170
 slightly how to move 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.799
 the lack of innovation they are all also worship to the very good mastery 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.430
 in this area of ​​the 2009 edition 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.650
 the concern is that these small changes contribute to the game annually 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.800
 better but on the contrary 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.770
 the game seems less effective the differences are very subtle but 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.860
 the regulars to feel them 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.330
 the game is still so deep and so difficult to handle and this is 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.660
 not the dude in the tutorial that will help you in this area 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.310
 the bases they are exposed to and my more complicated techniques are not 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.509
 addressed 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.739
 finally the complex controls 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.539
 reflects the diversity of this sport 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.239
 and in this second opus we would have appreciated to be able to enter more 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.099
 in more complete explanations 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 otherwise the concept remains the same and they will have the same functions 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.299
 a lot of the game's interest lies in the kind of strategy that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.000
 you used during the fighting 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.609
 it's against Iraq 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.250
 but against human opponents 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.599
 via Internet 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.590
 the title has a very long learning curve there you 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.480
 will take hours and hours to hope to get by with the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.529
 honors 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.889
 the very frustrating tutorial in this area 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.299
 because you finally did not like very much and you will have to discover 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.299
 the essentials of the high level 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.999
 by yourself 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:50.989
 overall 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.360
 the game a fantastic gameplay despite the time that needs to be invested for 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.789
 hope to get the difference between minimalism of victory 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:02.169
 although not an easy game and no doubt daunting at first by 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.719
 his arcore side 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.669
 everyone who spends a few hours on his touch 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.669
 discover a control system 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.699
 more about the game modes there is nothing above 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.769
 the game continues to offer a similar and generous conflict 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.219
 there are more than a hundred fighters on these 2010 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.609
 divided five to six wins 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.269
 with a handful of athletes 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.169
 who make their debut and other fabrics the previous deliveries 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.650
 to add yet this gigantic side 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.680
 the young teacher has the opportunity to create and modify our own 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.899
 fighter 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.159
 the petitions of the previous episodes opus of the series with more 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.900
 options 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.220
 and with many physical characteristics the general techniques 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
 to set its height weight these lands 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.769
 however this through the boot camp we really 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.939
 customize your fight and the way we're going to behave 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.200
 in the octagon 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.289
 the ring in a scene 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:00.499
 there are a number of places to train that we can visit a 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.469
 times a week in career mode 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.189
 if you are brave enough to face the trainings 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.269
 repetitive 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.790
 you will be able to enjoy this beautiful way your character 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.599
 of course 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.699
 the trainings are not all and you can of course participate 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.219
 to fights and then the tournament story to see your progress 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.819
 and in order to access the glory 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.819
 overall career mode is very good and offers hours of fun 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.200
 the downside is about the game's interface not at all replicate type 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.159
 another downside loading times that are sometimes longer 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.860
 that the fighting 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.629
 besides the countryside we spend the most time we also have the 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.629
 opportunity to do for example tournament this action 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.439
 regarding the online game that complements the game notes it offers to 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.439
 classic entertainment to fight battles against other players 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.670
 with a few months of lag 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.930
 casual 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.620
 if you do not know it yet know that the game is a plus 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.879
 closer to the public 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.759
 that we have to go back to access the psn store 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.169
 xbox live 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.639
 so be suspicious if you decide to buy this game 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.270
 on two occasions 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.479
 not much commented on puel knows the small team 2010 visually 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.659
 since the judge keeps the same frame as the previous episode with 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.650
 shades of green 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.780
 as already indicated the number of character models that has been 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.710
 increased 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.789
 but at the same time the contributions have been reworked 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.789
 there are still some small problems with some animations 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.789
 but in general the title about it is remarkable 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.180
 a little more fluidity and a better animation of the face 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.339
 according to m just to improve 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.659
 for the next edition 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.969
 5 the game works well from a technical point of view 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.879
 with a frankly good physics a little image per second stable laughs of 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.059
 lighting 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.209
 the soundtrack he's loaded with licensed songs mostly belonging 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:51.680
 to raf players 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.599
 the game embellished with bronze sound effects 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.309
 the location between heathlands includes only the text but this does not prevent us 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:01.309
 not to recognize that the voices of the English commentators are fantastic 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.589
 with a particular reference in the career mode 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.059
 in fact that the comments 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.089
 still reference to previous fights 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.789
 what we have done 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:11.740
 quick 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.339
 addictive extremely violent 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:15.169
 cfu 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.289
 she argues August 2010 he is consolidating his place as the best sports franchise of 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.529
 fight of the moment 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.020
 there is just need 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.389
 a little finishing coat in addition 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.469
 and more intuitive control 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.509
 to pass the rank of champion 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.509
 at the rank of master 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 thanks a rebellion 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.309
 see 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.300
 the 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.300
 the growth of tomorrow for a new show 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:04.259
 5 unpublished videos this planet go the 5 m the servers the green 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.539
 it's on video on demand 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:09.589
 in the times of singapore and 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:13.499
 in theory a little the volumes passed on our planet is rough
