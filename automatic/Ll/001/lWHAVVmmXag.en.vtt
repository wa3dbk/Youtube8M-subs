00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.320 
start selling different colors
individually<00:01:29.020> okay<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.720> but<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:33.080> just<00:01:33.440> an<00:01:33.620> idea

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
individually okay so but it just an idea

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.510 
individually okay so but it just an idea
because<00:01:35.330> it's<00:01:35.510> kind<00:01:35.780> kind<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.830> a<00:01:37.040> little<00:01:37.340> bit

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
because it's kind kind of a little bit

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.330 
because it's kind kind of a little bit
pricey<00:01:38.710> for<00:01:39.970> 40<00:01:40.970> bucks<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:42.020> getting<00:01:42.860> seven

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.990 
will do a little bit later detailed
video<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.640> have<00:03:08.239> about<00:03:08.769> all<00:03:09.769> colors<00:03:10.700> but<00:03:10.940> I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
video so I have about all colors but I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.879 
video so I have about all colors but I
main<00:03:11.540> them<00:03:11.780> using<00:03:12.319> a<00:03:13.130> little<00:03:13.459> bit<00:03:13.730> gray<00:03:14.150> to

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
main them using a little bit gray to

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.180 
main them using a little bit gray to
rust<00:03:15.889> and<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:17.420> will<00:03:17.989> shoot<00:03:18.260> close<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> picture

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
rust and I will shoot close a picture

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.349 
rust and I will shoot close a picture
about<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:19.850> I'm<00:03:20.480> using<00:03:21.730> 4-5<00:03:22.730> actually<00:03:23.239> no

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
about it so I'm using 4-5 actually no

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.580 
about it so I'm using 4-5 actually no
for<00:03:23.690> micro<00:03:24.470> brushes<00:03:25.510> okay<00:03:26.540> sometimes<00:03:27.230> I'm

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
for micro brushes okay sometimes I'm

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.809 
for micro brushes okay sometimes I'm
using<00:03:27.799> 5<00:03:28.160> 6

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
using 5 6

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:36.280 
using 5 6
they<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:31.549> by<00:03:31.760> major<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:35.090> tone<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:36.049> color

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
they just by major the tone of the color

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.780 
they just by major the tone of the color
so<00:03:38.620> grab<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.650> little<00:03:40.069> bit<00:03:41.170> apply<00:03:42.459> what<00:03:43.459> kind<00:03:43.700> of

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
so grab a little bit apply what kind of

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:52.160 
so grab a little bit apply what kind of
rust<00:03:44.180> if<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:45.760> ribs<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.870> some<00:03:48.170> rust

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.149 

then<00:03:53.170> I<00:03:53.290> blow<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.829> with<00:03:54.069> my<00:03:54.989> airbrush<00:03:55.989> gun<00:03:56.439> so

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
then I blow it with my airbrush gun so

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.179 
then I blow it with my airbrush gun so
this<00:03:57.939> is<00:03:58.299> guys<00:03:58.780> please<00:03:59.319> don't<00:03:59.530> think<00:03:59.799> don't

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
this is guys please don't think don't

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.220 
this is guys please don't think don't
get<00:04:00.370> me<00:04:00.549> wrong<00:04:00.579> it's<00:04:01.060> not<00:04:01.269> replacing<00:04:01.629> like

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
get me wrong it's not replacing like

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.380 
get me wrong it's not replacing like
detail<00:04:02.790> paint<00:04:04.980> weathering<00:04:05.980> solution<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.909> just

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
detail paint weathering solution it just

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.759 
detail paint weathering solution it just
gives<00:04:08.109> you<00:04:08.260> very<00:04:08.709> quick<00:04:09.069> if<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.370> have<00:04:09.579> 50<00:04:09.939> cars

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
gives you very quick if you have 50 cars

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:18.509 
gives you very quick if you have 50 cars
in<00:04:13.140> your<00:04:14.140> call<00:04:14.409> set<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:16.329> will<00:04:16.539> be<00:04:16.690> tough<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.519> do

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
in your call set it will be tough to do

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.449 
in your call set it will be tough to do
it<00:04:18.699> you<00:04:18.940> know<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.650> really<00:04:20.979> want<00:04:21.340> to

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
it you know but if you really want to

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.900 
it you know but if you really want to
really<00:04:21.970> quick<00:04:22.300> weather<00:04:22.690> them<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.699> make

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
really quick weather them just to make

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.390 
really quick weather them just to make
him<00:04:25.090> more<00:04:25.360> realistically<00:04:26.080> that's<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.190> way<00:04:27.340> to

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
him more realistically that's the way to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:35.240 
him more realistically that's the way to
go<00:04:27.729> before<00:04:28.599> I<00:04:29.250> spray<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:32.820> thin<00:04:33.990> white

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
go before I spray with the thin white

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:43.400 
go before I spray with the thin white
gray<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:39.810> little<00:04:40.810> bit<00:04:40.960> coat<00:04:41.259> so<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.770> gives<00:04:42.250> me

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
gray a little bit coat so it gives me

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.010 
gray a little bit coat so it gives me
just<00:04:44.410> small<00:04:45.400> flat<00:04:45.789> surface<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:46.690> it's<00:04:46.840> not

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
just small flat surface so it's not

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.689 
just small flat surface so it's not
completely<00:04:48.389> black<00:04:49.410> deep<00:04:50.410> black<00:04:50.740> then<00:04:51.460> you're

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
completely black deep black then you're

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.700 
completely black deep black then you're
just<00:04:51.910> doing<00:04:52.210> experimenting<00:04:53.139> you<00:04:53.320> know<00:04:53.470> with

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
just doing experimenting you know with

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.170 
just doing experimenting you know with
different<00:04:53.740> colors<00:04:54.699> you<00:04:55.030> know<00:04:57.659> using

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
different colors you know using

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.140 
different colors you know using
technique<00:05:01.180> whatever<00:05:01.479> you<00:05:01.750> like<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.289> know<00:05:03.150> so

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
technique whatever you like you know so

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.260 
technique whatever you like you know so
and<00:05:04.630> if<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.080> don't<00:05:05.349> like<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.889> let's<00:05:06.820> put<00:05:07.030> some

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
and if you don't like it let's put some

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.129 
and if you don't like it let's put some
black<00:05:07.479> over<00:05:09.449> gives<00:05:10.449> you<00:05:10.630> like<00:05:10.840> different

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
black over gives you like different

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:21.130 
black over gives you like different
stuff<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.860> became<00:05:15.639> really<00:05:16.210> cool

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.470 

there<00:05:21.650> may<00:05:21.770> be<00:05:21.800> maybe<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.910> little<00:05:22.940> bit<00:05:23.270> more

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
there may be maybe a little bit more

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.080 
there may be maybe a little bit more
great<00:05:24.310> something<00:05:25.310> like<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:26.470> some<00:05:27.470> breasts

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
great something like that some breasts

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:41.580 
great something like that some breasts
but<00:05:29.090> some<00:05:29.390> more<00:05:29.720> rust

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590
