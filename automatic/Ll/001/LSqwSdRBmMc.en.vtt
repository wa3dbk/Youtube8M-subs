00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.910 
too I bet I could check it across the
room<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.170> still<00:01:04.439> stay<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.739> one

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
room and it would still stay in one

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.490 
room and it would still stay in one
piece<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.430> nothing<00:01:05.790> would<00:01:05.909> happen<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
piece and nothing would happen to it the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
piece and nothing would happen to it the
drill<00:01:07.799> works<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.340> well<00:01:08.580> too
