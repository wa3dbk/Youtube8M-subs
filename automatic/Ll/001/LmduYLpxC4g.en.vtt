00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.750
 after I had my daughter I 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.010
 I do not do not deep desire of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 record everything she did 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.000
 and it made me go a little deeper 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.309
 more and want to know a little more 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.780
 a different lens to know how it is 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.660
 people could do those 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.610
 different focal points in the photos so 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.760
 a study there I found out that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.909
 The smaller the number here, the more 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.180
 you have in the background giving that 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.710
 magical feeling even that photo 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.010
 that is with that fund totally 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 and the baby fully focused 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 Dinho in the photo gets sweet getting 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.129
 professional 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.960
 practicality is very important because 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.900
 otherwise you lose a moment thereby 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.110
 very easy because if you 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.630
 want a bit more blurring in the 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.789
 background you have the one-touch option 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.460
 you determine if you want more 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.619
 blur or less blur this is 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.009
 interesting because you show more 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:27.070
 background or not you have a camera that she 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.090
 It has the possibility of changing the lens having 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.340
 multiple photo options on the same camera is 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.850
 excellent is different is 60mm 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 which macro you pick up with details you 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.810
 can get close to the eyelashes 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.750
 aa little mouth nails that are very 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.000
 delicate and small 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.080
 with the focus that with the talent you do not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 can 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.890
 besides photographing she films as the screen 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 it's tot I can change the focus just by touching 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.440
 on the screen 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.690
 so I can pass the focus of a 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.390
 airplane the other without you needing 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.150
 to move millions of functions back there is only 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.330
 a touch on the screen everything she does to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.400
 me is magic is important and with ssd 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.350
 It's very cool because it puts the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.510
 camera you can already see what 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.380
 you want even if the camera has the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.690
 floor 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.520
 makes it much easier to get 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.930
 record everything that I think is important 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.489
 of the attitude of my daughter who is everything 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 this record forever a quality 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.860
 very cool, it's like transferring me 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.870
 for that moment so impressive 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.060
 the ability of the machine 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.989
 a photo can do with 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.989
 a human being
