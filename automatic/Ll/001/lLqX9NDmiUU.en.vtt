00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.300
 Masu Tei 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.260

 The wound is or with it in there is Hey Oh, scratch and are doing somehow long 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:03.790
 It is likely to say that it is a city ​​pin, or that is what I bought, and that kind of thing 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.710
 Deep mahjong like tactics When it comes to professional level like me

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.890
 It 's a heart-to-heart dialogue that says true mahjong 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.069

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 Ne 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.690
 I can not see you because I can not see it a little 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.920
 It feels like this, and it looks like it's mahjong alone 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.830
 Say the mah-jongg in one person alone to do this doing when lonely alone 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:49.640

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:54.520
 I like going up in the translation good alone take on their own 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.520
 I went up alone up in something like one person 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.860
 Network this alone 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.910
 All the mahjong people do it well 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.420
 Yes 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.350
 As for me of withdrawal, the sound is withdrawn alone 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.000
 Gon Point 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.420
 Nde myself alone in I Agareru also ne ne Toka Kokushimuso anything 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.800
 I want to see Ston and Suma in Iino alignment 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.450
 After all form saying what about Mahjong tiles made of professional Appari bamboo This 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 I probably or 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.900
 I really have a premiere 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.830
 Well my own 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.050
 It's nice, this is Mahjong 牌 this 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.710
 Is it all hand-carved 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.330
 All hand-carved 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.520
 I understand , Bolly 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.900
 I wonder if seen 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:54.570
 Whether it's hand-carved this is also good and can be seen by bought Why hand-carved but it is the place can be seen 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.290
 I wonder why this is a lie I don't know how hand-carved it will end with this burger 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.140
 How 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.710
 The same guy and say you understand if there hand-carved in your what I think are people who say such a thing 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.660
 Compare 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.590
 For example, first 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:12.099
 It is supposed to be the first, and it's slightly different if you compare 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.850
 For example, wait a minute wait a minute I have or a little easy to understand if Nante'd'd 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.540
 I think 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.540
 Hair and hair 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.430
 I'll see it this way 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.430
 this 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.260
 And water like 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.680
 Hair and hair 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.030
 Can you see if you look at this delicately close 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.030
 It's slightly different 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:42.810
 Hand is carved Toko from those first sight with this full why 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.650
 Because different one by one between the hair and the hair this angle wings 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.720
 Take a look at this bow for example the first lower left bow 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:55.290
 It's not right 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:57.980
 This is a boy, maybe 50 years ago or maybe 60 years ago maybe China should be 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:04.370
 Or I do not know Japan 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:08.090
 Really the people really looking at this because it is said this Zushi I really Mahjong tiles that soul was muffled dug by hand 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.540
 I want to hit this for 10 million yen, but I will never get it 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.800
 Look this why well understood table is the moat is suppressed in this sense 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.680
 Kana look lords 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.350
 I'm out of focus 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.740
 Please look 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:26.950
 The angle of the finger is different The angle of the bow 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.580
 This love space of the lower left bow lower left meaning will be different 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.810
 This is completely hand-carved 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.870
 Besides , thanks to the real thing , the length is lengthy 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.260
 Yeah it's real without it 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.139
 Not sell to anyone yes 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:49.199
