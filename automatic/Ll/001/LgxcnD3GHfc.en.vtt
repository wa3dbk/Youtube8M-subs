00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
inequalities and wonders at the same

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
inequalities and wonders at the same
time<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.439> they're<00:01:52.590> fighting<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> good<00:01:53.130> fight

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
time so they're fighting a good fight

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
time so they're fighting a good fight
but<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.270> assassin<00:01:54.869> here

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
but it's not just one assassin here

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.230 
but it's not just one assassin here
there<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.189> they're<00:01:56.579> twins<00:01:56.969> mind

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
there are two and they're twins mind

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.600 
there are two and they're twins mind
alone<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.110> how<00:01:59.380> are<00:01:59.799> we<00:01:59.829> going<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.399> get<00:02:00.490> to

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.789 
alone so how are we going to get to
control<00:02:00.909> these<00:02:01.030> two<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.380> player<00:02:02.590> will<00:02:02.770> be

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
control these two so the player will be

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.310 
control these two so the player will be
