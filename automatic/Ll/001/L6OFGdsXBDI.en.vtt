00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
steer people away from okay so this is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.580 
steer people away from okay so this is
more<00:00:30.560> money<00:00:30.710> yes<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.460> retails<00:00:32.390> for<00:00:32.419> $2,500

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
more money yes it retails for $2,500

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.240 
more money yes it retails for $2,500
but<00:00:34.780> you<00:00:35.780> go<00:00:35.900> by<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.079> similar<00:00:36.680> twin<00:00:36.890> disc<00:00:37.070> and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
but you go by a similar twin disc and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.630 
but you go by a similar twin disc and
it's<00:00:37.340> gonna<00:00:37.430> be<00:00:37.579> about<00:00:38.140> $1,700

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
it's gonna be about $1,700

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.209 
it's gonna be about $1,700
$1,500<00:00:40.820> whatever<00:00:41.270> this<00:00:41.719> thing<00:00:42.050> will<00:00:42.710> last<00:00:42.890> you

is gonna help your launches also the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.780 
is gonna help your launches also the
extra<00:01:06.350> surface<00:01:06.530> area<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.280> triple<00:01:07.580> plates

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
extra surface area of the triple plates

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.490 
extra surface area of the triple plates
the<00:01:08.270> extra<00:01:08.570> surface<00:01:08.750> area<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.259> triple

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
the extra surface area of the triple

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.200 
the extra surface area of the triple
place<00:01:09.650> doesn't<00:01:10.189> let<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.400> heat<00:01:10.549> buildup<00:01:10.970> in

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
place doesn't let the heat buildup in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.810 
place doesn't let the heat buildup in
the<00:01:11.450> clutch<00:01:11.630> plates<00:01:11.900> and<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.890> clutches<00:01:13.310> will

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
the clutch plates and the clutches will

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.740 
the clutch plates and the clutches will
hold<00:01:14.060> more<00:01:14.330> torque<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:16.330> basically<00:01:17.330> they<00:01:17.600> will

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
hold more torque and basically they will

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.950 
hold more torque and basically they will
last<00:01:18.020> longer<00:01:19.210> also<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> have<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.509> better

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
last longer also you have a better

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.690 
last longer also you have a better
engagement<00:01:21.140> window<00:01:21.770> because<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.400> triple

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
engagement window because it's a triple

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.899 
engagement window because it's a triple
disc<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.420> drives<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.320> lot<00:01:24.560> nicer<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.640> lot

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
disc it drives a lot nicer a lot

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.030 
disc it drives a lot nicer a lot
smoother<00:01:26.299> drives<00:01:26.630> like<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.960> stock<00:01:27.259> clutch<00:01:27.500> say

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
smoother drives like a stock clutch say

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.800 
smoother drives like a stock clutch say

everyday and not look like an amateur
trying<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:35.720> pull<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.930> off<00:01:36.020> parking<00:01:36.259> lot<00:01:36.790> you're

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
trying to pull it off parking lot you're

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.370 
trying to pull it off parking lot you're
not<00:01:37.880> gonna<00:01:38.060> have<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.270> rev<00:01:38.570> your<00:01:38.869> motors<00:01:38.930> so

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
not gonna have to rev your motors so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.840 
not gonna have to rev your motors so
high<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.890> get<00:01:40.009> moving<00:01:40.340> because<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.670> thing

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
high to get moving because this thing

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.609 
high to get moving because this thing
has<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.970> lot<00:01:41.149> of<00:01:41.180> inertia<00:01:41.420> you're<00:01:42.350> gonna<00:01:42.439> be

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
has a lot of inertia you're gonna be

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.170 
has a lot of inertia you're gonna be
able<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.860> pull<00:01:43.070> away<00:01:43.159> nice<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:43.970> easy

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
able to pull away nice and easy

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.889 
able to pull away nice and easy
so<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.439> doesn't<00:01:45.920> attract<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.250> fuzz<00:01:46.490> right

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
so that doesn't attract the fuzz right

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.990 
so that doesn't attract the fuzz right
and<00:01:48.140> second<00:01:48.860> of<00:01:48.920> all<00:01:49.009> does<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.549> wear<00:01:49.759> out<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
and second of all does it wear out the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.039 
and second of all does it wear out the
clutch<00:01:50.180> because<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.630> don't<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.899> use<00:01:51.020> a

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
clutch because you don't have to use a

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.230 
clutch because you don't have to use a
lot<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.380> RPM<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.219> get<00:01:52.340> moving<00:01:52.670> because<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.119> has

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
lot of RPM to get moving because it has

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.450 
lot of RPM to get moving because it has
more<00:01:53.450> mess<00:01:53.689> get<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.850> simple<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.340> when<00:01:58.340> you

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
more mess get it it's simple so when you

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.209 
more mess get it it's simple so when you
do<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.790> calculations<00:01:59.560> you<00:02:00.560> got<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.950> clutch

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
do the calculations you got a clutch

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.749 
do the calculations you got a clutch
that's<00:02:01.520> gonna<00:02:01.759> give<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.030> better<00:02:02.479> launches

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
that's gonna give you better launches

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.550 
that's gonna give you better launches
