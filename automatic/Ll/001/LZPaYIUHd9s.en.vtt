00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.410
 technically means telecommunications wanted 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.640
 admission 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.050
 transmission 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.200
 and percent playback of signals 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 Exchange of signals in general 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.640
 It is demanded that communication at any time and in any place 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.090
 should be possible 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.950
 and telecommunications 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 creates the requirement of 4 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.550
 independently 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.870
 from the transmission route Lyon 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.340
 In this case, the wired wireless can change wirelessly 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.390
 Naturally, Kir Sender can also be a conversation partner 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.820
 in television programs are hardly a picture full of green artificial 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 Lectures Picture in 30-second-clock no picture APA Kassel Seidl a fantasy 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.080
 football-fest image before 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.390
 won five games 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.270
 images 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.270
 the students today he will be his cell phone 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.850
 The mobile phone is he always the central point in Bönen our whole 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.820
 know-how is in there and development in this direction continues 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.939
 Examples are Egypt Percent Telephony 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.439
 Percent of our UMTS is not yet fully developed there are of course the 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.309
 fast data transfer through the weekend with your mobile phone to the Internet 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.429
 go 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.769
 So we still have so many easy-to-handle future projects 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.309
 Manama is a freelance Merkel I am currently in the sixth semester of 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.149
 Degree Program Communications Engineering 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.449
 and I am 22 years old after graduation I have percent for this 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.489
 Degree program in communications engineering 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.069
 even though I have precious basic physics in materialism as well 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.010
 noticed that with these technical developments percent have a lot of fun 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.230
 makes this discovered percent of physical backgrounds and me 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.959
 think that you will continue to develop well in this area in the future 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.379
 may also be after this degree program 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.619
 So here's the experience, that's women 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:09.489
 if they have chosen these studies Kant besides all the rule in the top 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.829
 Third high 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.809
 is incompetent in terms of communication 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.099
 and I think women are slightly more than men 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.039
 because they are unconscious percent 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.000
 knowledge 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.799
 the Russians I have to come to the same level with the other 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.169
 then I can tell you something 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.440
 and in that sense 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.079
 I think it is very nice 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.379
 if more women 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.819
 Telecommunications 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.489
 Brar would study 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.329
 to be able to use this same competence 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:42.929
 that looks 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:43.770
 so 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.589
 actually know better 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:47.739
 communication 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.739
 can be produced 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.519
 he would have started his studies already this study I have an education 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.519
 as a media designer image and powerlessness 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.810
 and that's where the shisha area was the most interesting 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.999
 no longer very quickly made it clear that a study of 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.779
 Would like to join telecommunications engineering 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.689
 as a particularly great Fr TDI I find that fair 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.549
 and many labs have the Mündener four tracks is a learning 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.239
 So I find out that I'm burning under guys action gift Rendsburg for 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.029
 AIDS 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 tested almost only girl 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.110
 we are dealing here in this lab 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.839
 with the procedure of Anna Lohmann and digital transmission technology 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.290
 and the students go from baseline procedures in this field 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.710
 one should 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.699
 opt for math 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.810
 Natural sciences general interest 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.569
 that does not mean that you have to have good grades on average 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.749
 or a high school certificate 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.379
 But India should be related 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.080
 can deepen and 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.589
 recognize logical connections and 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:25.440
 deal with 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.599
 that was pretty hard for me in the beginning 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.289
 I mess it up math was already there 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.529
 pretty hard but with a lot of ambition and 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.740
 for personal initiative 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.180
 if I'm actually quite good 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.659
 curiosity 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.099
 primarily a prerequisite for every engineer 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.099
 Every child actually brings curiosity net 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.779
 from the SC unfortunately 

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:56.649
 a and percent an engineer should she always be that of curiosity 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.019
 has not lost yet who it is a concern 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.080
 new to samples 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.669
 try new new procedures apply method from another 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.669
 To take over areas 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:21.869
 Helps engineers have to worry about life's future 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.139
 what, for example, human communication should look like in the future 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.099
 or to what extent human communication village 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.469
 Percent technology communication will be replaced
