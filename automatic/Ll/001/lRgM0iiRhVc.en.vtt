millimeter<00:00:30.029> hose<00:00:30.300> now<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.109> fits<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.470> there

millimeter hose now that fits on there

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.580 
millimeter hose now that fits on there
snug<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.700> hose<00:00:33.030> itself<00:00:33.480> isn't<00:00:34.230> getting<00:00:34.469> in

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
snug the hose itself isn't getting in

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
snug the hose itself isn't getting in
the<00:00:34.649> way<00:00:34.770> at<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> know<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.300> sand

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the way at all so you know I can sand

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.920 
the way at all so you know I can sand
away<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> ball<00:00:37.489> now<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.270> had<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> four

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
away and have a ball now if I had a four

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
away and have a ball now if I had a four
inch<00:00:40.110> hose<00:00:40.649> hanging<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.610> it

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
inch hose hanging off the back of it

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.840 
inch hose hanging off the back of it
that<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.469> awkward<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that would be a little awkward you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.010 
that would be a little awkward you can
imagine<00:00:45.059> yeah<00:00:45.680> it's<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> work

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
imagine yeah it's just not going to work

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.680 
imagine yeah it's just not going to work
so<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.430> doing<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.820> though<00:00:51.059> if

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
so there is a way of doing it though if

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
so there is a way of doing it though if
you<00:00:51.899> need<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> four<00:00:52.949> inch<00:00:53.100> hose<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you need to use a four inch hose and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
you need to use a four inch hose and
that's<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.940> you've<00:00:54.180> got<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:55.230> away

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
that's all you've got you can get away

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
that's all you've got you can get away
with<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> by<00:00:56.430> putting<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.879> four<00:00:57.120> inch<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.510> inch

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
will work but nowhere near as

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.500 
will work but nowhere near as

shop<00:01:25.049> vacs<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> same<00:01:26.220> principle<00:01:26.790> of

shop vacs have the same principle of

shop vacs have the same principle of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
creating a low air pressure as do the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.580 
creating a low air pressure as do the
larger<00:01:31.490> dust<00:01:32.490> extractors<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.350> get

larger dust extractors but they get

larger dust extractors but they get
there<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.979> slightly<00:01:35.250> different<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:35.850> dust

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there in a slightly different way dust

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
there in a slightly different way dust
extractors<00:01:37.170> tend<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> spin<00:01:37.950> around<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.579> have

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
extractors tend to spin around this have

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
extractors tend to spin around this have
a<00:01:39.060> large<00:01:39.329> fan<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> spins<00:01:39.990> around<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
a large fan that spins around and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.069 
a large fan that spins around and
centrifugal<00:01:41.250> force<00:01:41.670> froze<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.299> air<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
centrifugal force froze the air out and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.160 
centrifugal force froze the air out and
creates<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:44.070> low-pressure<00:01:44.820> which<00:01:45.780> pulls

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
creates this low-pressure which pulls

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.010 
creates this low-pressure which pulls
the<00:01:46.290> air<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.890> through<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.520> large<00:01:47.909> impeller<00:01:48.570> now

slightly differently shop vacs use a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.110 
slightly differently shop vacs use a

through<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:31.550> constricted<00:02:32.550> area<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.390> it's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
through a constricted area so it's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.600

continues<00:03:02.430> long<00:03:02.610> through<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.850> hose<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.360> then

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
continues long through the hose and then

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.350 
continues long through the hose and then
at<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.890> end<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.130> hose<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.460> plugs<00:03:05.790> into<00:03:06.000> a

there<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.130> go<00:03:26.220> see<00:03:26.490> can't<00:03:27.300> shut<00:03:27.740> sometimes

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
there you go see can't shut sometimes

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.490 
there you go see can't shut sometimes
when<00:03:29.010> these<00:03:29.160> are<00:03:29.340> pulling<00:03:29.580> really<00:03:29.730> hard<00:03:30.500> the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
when these are pulling really hard the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.550 
when these are pulling really hard the
air<00:03:31.740> pressure<00:03:31.980> will<00:03:32.960> pull<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.110> gate<00:03:34.320> shut

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
air pressure will pull that gate shut

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.090 
air pressure will pull that gate shut
but<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:35.520> don't<00:03:35.670> want<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.910> happen<00:03:36.210> okay<00:03:37.100> so

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
but we don't want that happen okay so

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.020 
but we don't want that happen okay so
that's<00:03:38.340> how<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.580> works

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
that's how that works

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.500 
that's how that works
now<00:03:39.870> next<00:03:40.740> part<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.100> stage<00:03:41.330> will<00:03:42.330> pull

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
now next part of the stage will pull

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.360 
now next part of the stage will pull
those<00:03:42.630> off<00:03:42.870> there<00:03:45.560> two<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.710> a<00:03:46.740> half<00:03:46.920> inch<00:03:47.160> or

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.780 
these things the two and a half inch
side<00:03:53.460> pushes<00:03:54.450> into<00:03:54.630> there<00:03:55.280> perfectly<00:03:56.280> look<00:03:56.670> at

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
side pushes into there perfectly look at

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.700 
side pushes into there perfectly look at
that<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.860> now<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.130> have<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.760> blast<00:04:00.720> gate<00:04:00.990> let's

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
that so now I have a blast gate let's

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.660 
that so now I have a blast gate let's
see<00:04:01.830> if<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:01.950> can<00:04:02.070> see<00:04:02.220> right<00:04:02.400> down<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.640> middle

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
see if I can see right down the middle

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.020 
see if I can see right down the middle
yep<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.730> end<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.910> my<00:04:06.000> pipe<00:04:06.240> brilliant<00:04:07.880> now

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
yep on the end of my pipe brilliant now

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.250 
yep on the end of my pipe brilliant now
the<00:04:11.030> next<00:04:11.240> step<00:04:11.420> put<00:04:12.070> all<00:04:13.070> your<00:04:13.160> pipe<00:04:13.340> up<00:04:14.260> try

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
the next step put all your pipe up try

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.910 
the next step put all your pipe up try
not<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:16.340> do<00:04:16.549> 90-degree<00:04:17.360> bends<00:04:17.810> if<00:04:18.739> you're

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
not to do 90-degree bends if you're

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.710 
not to do 90-degree bends if you're
going<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.100> do<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> 90-degree<00:04:19.700> Bend<00:04:19.910> do<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.330> sweep

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
going to do a 90-degree Bend do a sweep

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.810 
going to do a 90-degree Bend do a sweep
don't<00:04:21.260> do<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.410> hard<00:04:21.650> corner<00:04:21.950> like<00:04:22.100> this<00:04:22.130> you

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
don't do a hard corner like this you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.340 
don't do a hard corner like this you
lose<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.120> lot<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.660> your<00:04:24.820> velocity<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:26.870> your<00:04:27.170> air

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
lose a lot of your velocity in your air

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.030 
lose a lot of your velocity in your air
flow<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.680> best<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.520> do<00:04:28.730> a<00:04:28.940> 45<00:04:29.630> or<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.080> couple<00:04:30.980> of

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
flow this best to do a 45 or a couple of

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.650 
flow this best to do a 45 or a couple of
45s<00:04:31.730> or<00:04:32.030> as<00:04:32.450> I'm<00:04:32.780> saying<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.170> 90<00:04:33.470> degree<00:04:33.710> sweep

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
45s or as I'm saying a 90 degree sweep

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.180 
45s or as I'm saying a 90 degree sweep
pretty<00:04:35.660> easy<00:04:35.840> so<00:04:36.080> far<00:04:36.640> now<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:39.620> travels<00:04:40.070> around

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
pretty easy so far now it travels around

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.430 
pretty easy so far now it travels around
on<00:04:40.490> my<00:04:40.610> ceiling<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.180> might<00:04:41.510> be<00:04:41.780> able<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.230> see

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
on my ceiling you might be able to see

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.930 
on my ceiling you might be able to see
some<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.860> it<00:04:42.950> there<00:04:43.160> let's<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.490> swing<00:04:43.820> this

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
some of it there let's just swing this

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:49.420 
some of it there let's just swing this
around<00:04:46.510> yep<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:48.650> can<00:04:48.740> see<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.980> pipe<00:04:49.160> running

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
around yep you can see the pipe running

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.910 
around yep you can see the pipe running
down<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.730> middle<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.410> there's<00:04:51.410> a<00:04:51.500> point<00:04:51.680> down

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
down the middle and there's a point down

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.420 
down the middle and there's a point down
there<00:04:52.190> but<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.210> picks<00:04:53.420> up<00:04:53.540> on<00:04:54.010> top<00:04:55.010> down<00:04:55.220> there

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
there but it picks up on top down there

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.260 
there but it picks up on top down there
and<00:04:55.520> point<00:04:55.670> out<00:04:55.820> it<00:04:57.580> you<00:04:58.580> guys<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.910> pick<00:04:59.150> up

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
and point out it you guys a pick up

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.260 
and point out it you guys a pick up
point<00:04:59.510> down<00:04:59.690> here<00:05:00.610> another<00:05:01.610> one<00:05:01.790> there<00:05:01.850> that<00:05:02.240> I

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
point down here another one there that I

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.550 
point down here another one there that I
pulled<00:05:02.540> off<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.810> top<00:05:02.990> there<00:05:03.200> to<00:05:03.320> show<00:05:03.500> you

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
pulled off the top there to show you

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.430 
pulled off the top there to show you
you'll<00:05:04.490> notice<00:05:04.880> that<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.300> don't<00:05:05.660> glue<00:05:06.020> my

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
you'll notice that I don't glue my

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.640 
you'll notice that I don't glue my
fittings<00:05:06.770> together<00:05:07.120> these<00:05:08.120> things<00:05:08.650> stay

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
fittings together these things stay

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.500 
fittings together these things stay
tight<00:05:09.920> they're<00:05:10.400> not<00:05:10.610> there<00:05:11.120> though<00:05:11.270> they

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
tight they're not there though they

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.990 
tight they're not there though they
don't<00:05:11.990> come<00:05:12.110> off<00:05:12.230> easily<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:13.010> also<00:05:13.850> if<00:05:13.910> you

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
don't come off easily and also if you

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 
don't come off easily and also if you
want<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.210> change<00:05:14.480> things<00:05:14.690> around<00:05:15.020> it's<00:05:15.890> going

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
want to change things around it's going

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.920 
want to change things around it's going
to<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:16.310> much<00:05:16.430> easier<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:17.510> there<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.750> go

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
to be so much easier so there you go

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.550 
to be so much easier so there you go
these<00:05:18.380> are<00:05:18.680> fantastic

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
these are fantastic

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.740 
these are fantastic
from<00:05:21.560> there<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.400> tracks<00:05:23.030> around<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.660> then

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
from there it tracks around and then

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.680 
from there it tracks around and then
comes<00:05:23.960> down<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.440> wall<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:26.120> might<00:05:26.450> show<00:05:26.660> you

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
comes down the wall and I might show you

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.480 
comes down the wall and I might show you
that<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.140> then<00:05:27.740> under<00:05:28.190> there<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:30.490> fitting

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
that and then under there that fitting

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.220 
that and then under there that fitting
right<00:05:31.760> up<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.030> back<00:05:32.210> that's<00:05:32.750> got<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:32.990> ninety

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
right up the back that's got the ninety

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.570 
right up the back that's got the ninety
degree<00:05:33.500> Bend<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.890> I<00:05:33.919> just<00:05:34.160> told<00:05:34.370> you

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
degree Bend that I just told you

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.909 
degree Bend that I just told you
everyone<00:05:34.730> don't<00:05:35.360> do<00:05:35.510> it<00:05:35.690> that<00:05:36.620> goes<00:05:37.120> through

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
everyone don't do it that goes through

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.420 
everyone don't do it that goes through
onto<00:05:39.919> that<00:05:40.730> gray<00:05:41.240> flexi<00:05:41.660> hose<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:43.040> flexi

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
onto that gray flexi hose and the flexi

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.580 
onto that gray flexi hose and the flexi
hose<00:05:43.610> goes<00:05:43.880> into<00:05:44.150> my<00:05:44.240> cyclone<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:44.900> the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
hose goes into my cyclone and the

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.130 
hose goes into my cyclone and the
cyclone<00:05:46.120> spins<00:05:47.120> all<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.419> rubbish<00:05:47.690> out<00:05:47.810> of<00:05:48.020> the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
cyclone spins all the rubbish out of the

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.620 
cyclone spins all the rubbish out of the
Airstream<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:49.610> crap<00:05:49.850> drops<00:05:50.090> down<00:05:50.240> into<00:05:50.480> that

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
Airstream the crap drops down into that

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.110 
Airstream the crap drops down into that
bin<00:05:50.810> in<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:50.990> bottom<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:52.100> the<00:05:52.220> fresh<00:05:52.460> air<00:05:52.669> or

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
bin in the bottom and the fresh air or

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.740 
bin in the bottom and the fresh air or
mostly<00:05:53.750> fresh<00:05:54.050> comes<00:05:54.770> up<00:05:55.010> through<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.550> top<00:05:55.820> it

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
mostly fresh comes up through the top it

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.580 
mostly fresh comes up through the top it
gets<00:05:56.900> up<00:05:57.140> there<00:05:57.320> because<00:05:57.680> this<00:05:57.950> guy<00:05:58.160> here<00:05:58.520> is

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
gets up there because this guy here is

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.980 
gets up there because this guy here is
creating<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:01.100> low-pressure<00:06:02.060> or<00:06:02.419> negative

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
creating the low-pressure or negative

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.100 
creating the low-pressure or negative
air<00:06:03.110> pressure<00:06:03.140> and<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:04.370> it's<00:06:04.610> sucking<00:06:04.940> as<00:06:05.240> per

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
air pressure and so it's sucking as per

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.280 
air pressure and so it's sucking as per
any<00:06:06.440> normal<00:06:06.890> vacuum<00:06:07.010> cleaner<00:06:07.930> how<00:06:08.930> cool<00:06:09.140> is

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
any normal vacuum cleaner how cool is

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.430 
any normal vacuum cleaner how cool is

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
mine been straight out the wall because

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.930 
mine been straight out the wall because
I'm<00:06:15.740> in<00:06:15.890> a<00:06:15.950> situation<00:06:16.460> where<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.640> don't<00:06:16.790> have

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
I'm in a situation where I don't have

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.400 
I'm in a situation where I don't have
neighbors<00:06:17.860> on<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.039> top<00:06:19.250> there<00:06:20.060> is<00:06:20.419> a<00:06:20.780> switch

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
neighbors on the top there is a switch

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.679 
neighbors on the top there is a switch
that<00:06:21.919> changes<00:06:22.370> from<00:06:22.550> automatic<00:06:22.970> to<00:06:23.150> man

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:23.689 
that changes from automatic to man

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.570 
that changes from automatic to man
or<00:06:23.809> you<00:06:24.289> can<00:06:24.439> see<00:06:24.649> there<00:06:24.889> there's<00:06:25.279> a<00:06:25.369> power

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
or you can see there there's a power

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.359 
or you can see there there's a power
point<00:06:25.789> that<00:06:26.509> point<00:06:26.869> power<00:06:27.110> point<00:06:27.379> runs<00:06:27.709> up<00:06:27.919> to

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:28.369 
point that point power point runs up to

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:31.629 
point that point power point runs up to
a<00:06:28.659> splitter<00:06:29.659> and<00:06:29.899> then<00:06:30.349> it<00:06:30.469> runs<00:06:30.739> the<00:06:31.399> power

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
a splitter and then it runs the power

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.109 
a splitter and then it runs the power
runs<00:06:31.879> down<00:06:32.119> to<00:06:32.449> above<00:06:33.439> every<00:06:33.829> outlet<00:06:34.159> on<00:06:34.339> every

00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:35.119 
runs down to above every outlet on every

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:37.299 
runs down to above every outlet on every
machine<00:06:35.269> that<00:06:35.629> I<00:06:35.689> have<00:06:35.869> in<00:06:35.989> the<00:06:36.049> workshop<00:06:36.409> and
