out what car needs exhaust straight out
of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.019> top<00:00:55.229> then<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.949> bigger<00:00:56.220> this<00:00:56.699> came

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
of the top then think bigger this came

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.610 
of the top then think bigger this came
out<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.330> tank<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.199> next<00:00:58.470> question

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
out of a tank and the next question

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.390 
out of a tank and the next question
where's<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.519> radiator<00:01:00.559> was<00:01:01.559> gonna<00:01:01.799> put<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
where's the radiator was gonna put the

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.109 
where's the radiator was gonna put the
radiators<00:01:02.909> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> front<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.820> doesn't

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
radiators on the front and it doesn't

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.609 
radiators on the front and it doesn't
really<00:01:06.240> work<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.659> properly<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> doesn't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
really work out properly so it doesn't

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
really work out properly so it doesn't
that's<00:01:08.010> why<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> run<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> big<00:01:08.820> copper<00:01:09.030> pipes

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that's why I run the big copper pipes

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
that's why I run the big copper pipes
all<00:01:09.570> down<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> study<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
all down to the back when you study it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.880 
all down to the back when you study it
there's<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> mile<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.750> copper<00:01:12.900> piping

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.100 

hydraulics<00:01:21.880> kind<00:01:22.300> of<00:01:22.420> came<00:01:22.570> along<00:01:22.840> when<00:01:23.020> it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
hydraulics kind of came along when it

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.570 
hydraulics kind of came along when it
mates<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.500> wanting<00:01:23.890> to<00:01:23.950> make<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.190> wheels<00:01:24.370> come

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
mates is wanting to make the wheels come

off<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.760> ground<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.210> says<00:01:25.840> that's<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.140> good<00:01:26.170> idea

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
off the ground I says that's a good idea

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.640 
off the ground I says that's a good idea
not<00:01:27.460> knowing<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.910> complications<00:01:28.720> but<00:01:29.440> got

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
a lot of cars dumped on the ground but

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.970 
a lot of cars dumped on the ground but
the<00:01:39.600> wheels<00:01:39.750> don't<00:01:39.990> come<00:01:40.110> off<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> ground<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
the wheels don't come off the ground and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.040 
the wheels don't come off the ground and
there<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.910> buzz<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.270> us<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.660> just<00:01:42.840> to
