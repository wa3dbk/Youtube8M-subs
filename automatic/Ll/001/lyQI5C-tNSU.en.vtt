basically you apply the clay to all of
the<00:03:28.180> hair<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.770> probably<00:03:29.770> could<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.070> used<00:03:30.250> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
the hair I probably could have used a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.010 
the hair I probably could have used a
little<00:03:30.400> bit<00:03:30.610> more<00:03:30.700> clay<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.510> it's<00:03:31.660> still

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
little bit more clay because it's still
