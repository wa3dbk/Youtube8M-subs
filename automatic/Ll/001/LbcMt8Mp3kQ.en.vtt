 kit ultrasound system 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.690
 asic consists 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:23.919
 software documentation disc 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:23.919
 provide usb cable type ebay 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:34.480
 power cable signal cable 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:44.920
 interface loop and most importantly block 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.360
 ultrasonic sensor controls 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.229
 besides natural kit 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.900
 it is completed with a mill for drilling 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.070
 holes for the installation of ultrasonic 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:07.450
 sensor cutter has a diameter of 21 and 7 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:11.750
 millimeters and two sets 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.500
 ultrasonic sensors of different lengths 1 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.630
 kit 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.750
 these are four ultrasonic sensors of length 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:25.030
 2 and a half meters in the second set 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:29.540
 sensors 4 pieces of 8 meters in length and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.730
 now consider each item 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.670
 set separately disk with 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.430
 software and documentation 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 contains the software itself 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.430
 supply to control unit 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.370
 ultrasonic sensors 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.650
 also instructions for installing the system on 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.390
 car and 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.440
 installation and configuration instructions 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.729
 software usb cable us 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.360
 required to connect using 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.060
 computer control unit sensors 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.700
 we need a power cable for 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.250
 connect the control unit to the source 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.049
 power supply in case the unit 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.610
 control uses bluetooth 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.610
 computer interface 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:23.170
 we need a signal loop for 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.750
 connecting the control unit 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 such signals as a pointer to the left 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.090
 turn right turn indicator stop 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.750
 signal and reverse signal 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.349
 interface cable is more needed for 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 developers who can 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.310
 need to connect directly to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.519
 control unit processor via uart 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:55.939
 interface also interface connector 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:03:02.319
 bust lines 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.319
 control has a power connector 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.900
 signal connector interface connector 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:15.919
 usb type connector on the other hand 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.019
 the control unit has 8 connectors for 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:21.889
 connect 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:25.569
 ultrasonic sensors on the cover 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:30.609
 shells are led signal lights 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:33.500
 The upper sensor light indicates 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.940
 radiation at a particular time 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.129
 ultrasound from the display sensors he's on 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.349
 lamp connection means connection with 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:49.419
 computer via usb or bluetooth 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:51.760
 interface two other lamps rx and tx 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:56.060
 signals the exchange of data between 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:59.959
 processor and interface adapter 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.799
 installed in the control unit with 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.310
 using art interface and last 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:11.900
 the lamp signals power supply 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:17.389
 on the control unit about ultrasound 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.560
 sensor as I said cutter 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.800
 we need to drill holes 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.330
 diameter of 21 and 7 millimeters 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.260
 I want to stay in more detail at 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.930
 ultrasonic sensors themselves look 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.040
 he so the sensor have 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:43.310
 special sealed connector this 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:46.490
 connector is needed in order to 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.620
 damage to the sensor we could promptly 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.860
 replace it with the sensors itself 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.920
 here is literally a few dozen 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.960
 centimeters in sensor performance 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.020
 It is worth noting that he has 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.570
 horizontal pattern 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.930
 120 degrees vertical 80 degrees 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:16.310
 a set of four sensors more 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.790
 lengths worth noting that the sensors have 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.470
 cable length is 8 meters and it is 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.950
 the maximum allowable at which we 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.330
 guarantee the correct operation of the ultra 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.330
