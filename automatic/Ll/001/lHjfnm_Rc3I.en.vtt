00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello everyone with you hamish sew in it 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.490
 I'll tell you about the prize of the eighth 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.130
 level this is British us heavy tanchik 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.940
 will it be called a45 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 well or fv 205 machine pretty 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 interesting and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 I would like to believe that this tank is all 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.880
 still not going to do at level eight on 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.420
 seventh and now I will explain why well 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.369
 First of all 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.679
 information about the fact that this tank 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.260
 It will already be one hundred percent since this 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.820
 Tanchik lit up in like that with which 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.960
 last from 91 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.850
 there he was in the video for 45 seconds 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.829
 so those who do not believe that here I am 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 Now I say that this tank will be and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.379
 etc. can go turn on ktts 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.480
 and turn it on for 45 seconds you will see 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 typewriter that is very similar to the quarry 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 navona but this is not a career norman first 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.670
 due to the fact that you can see a machine gunner 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.120
 there but secondly because he 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 differs quite a bit in general not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 bother about it just if 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 you are interested and you are not sure that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.549
 this tank will then turn on the cafe test but 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.479
 attacks can say it's the same 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.420
 caernarvon 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.100
 stands only who have us 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 such a machine gun in the forehead pretty 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 strange and incomprehensible why he's on a tank 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.110
 but he is well, it's such a little bit 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 another modification first is the tank 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.080
 will be a little bit slower than 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.909
 caernarvon that is, it will be quite 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.619
 slowly will not even be the maximum speed 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.860
 typing here is likely to be 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.960
 stock engine from cai-1 insist plus 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.030
 here will be a weapon hang up prince well then 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.979
 there is the same 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.710
 17-pound that I am on t15 from us 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.310
 on premium and the same as on black 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.090
 prince and 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.939
 we had 171 memories available on this 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.790
 guns and in my 150 elves 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.670
 that is, when of course it will be pretty 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.469
 yet fast and yes the instrument will be accurate and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 boiling fast of course it's good 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.869
 but still it will not be enough for 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.280
 level eight on level eight have 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.399
 such a bad gun it 's still 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.980
 as in any way does not fit anywhere okay 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.560
 pandan at15 and which is 7 is it 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.180
 the instrument is still somehow tolerable besides 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.069
 the way to the toga second location 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.140
 outflow 2 we generally at the sixth level then 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.870
 there is this tank can not be shoved on the eighth 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.760
 level if only developer somehow 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.530
 rework and something themselves screwed 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.810
 You can push on the eighth level to give 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.450
 he is there the price is there 10 thousand gold 12 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.700
 Of course, but I think it would be correct 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.890
 put him on signals was give him 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.430
 the price is about six seven thousand gold 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 conditionally yes maybe even 5 then it would be 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.570
 would be more popular tanchik it on the floor 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.500
 more people this would be more 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.510
 fair 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.310
 here of course there will be a good head 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 armor penetration as much as two hundred thirty 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.530
 nine millimeters armor penetration 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.970
 I just like this 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.850
 breakthrough can be at eights 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.340
 go but damn but if you will 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.370
 lose nines then even 239 gave a breakthrough 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.739
 with a small caliber so well 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.470
 nowhere does not fit anyway it will be 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.900
 very very little but on the armor that here 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.930
 we have 130 millimeters wld 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.180
 it is but not bad in principle and angle 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.579
 not a bad vd star would be too 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.549
 easy to break through but there is a nld which will 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.170
 easy to fight there is this machine gunner in 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.769
 forehead that will all shoot a hundred 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.380
 percent 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.299
 there is still the roof of the tower that will sew 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.880
 with the only thing that can be masked 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.799
 tank and wld but it's like that with a panda and 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.430
 after 1 that is essentially this tank 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.200
 pretty vulnerable 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.760
 slow and amateur that is special 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.510
 He won't have popularity when 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.820
 lead but lead him for sure in the future 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.060
 patches can even in 92 already he will be in 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.430
 the game so in principle on the tank more 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.370
 nothing to say my opinion is that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.040
 until the tank is just for an amateur that is 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.350
 Of course, someone will like it and 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.390
 the coupe is enough people but special 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.340
 popularity, he will not pick up as give 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.430
 british branch does not have 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.290
 the popularity of tyazh is not in everyone 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.780
 the battle meets this British strands 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.290
 other and what about the bonus if 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.709
 there are those 25 tons area who will need 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.359
 this and 45 that is, you understand my thoughts but 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.910
 so write your opinion necessarily in 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.039
 comments on this tank well if you 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.960
 want more vangovanie others right x 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.580
 other typewriters and other things necessarily 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.479
 write about it in the comments and put 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.699
 huskies 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.669
 I will still make video pimples 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.410
 soviet on base 62 and movies are still there 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.470
 I have a lot of things in principle 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.259
 Stock up there but I'm so quietly it's all 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.940
 do not to shower a bunch 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.270
 information that information was 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.970
 gradually but so with it everything was with you 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.979
 Hamish I hope you were interested 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.389
 be sure to like the subscribe 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.820
 on the channel I'm sorry that I am a little bit 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.970
 hesitated agreed maybe 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.259
 repeated well and stay with me 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.259
