eBay<00:00:53.770> for<00:00:53.829> about<00:00:54.010> 10<00:00:54.430> a--<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:55.180> we<00:00:56.140> got<00:00:56.440> several

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
eBay for about 10 a-- so we got several

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.180 
eBay for about 10 a-- so we got several
of<00:00:57.250> them<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:58.530> started<00:00:59.530> trying<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.860> work<00:01:00.010> out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
of them and started trying to work out

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.040 
of them and started trying to work out
how<00:01:00.309> we<00:01:00.340> could<00:01:00.610> use<00:01:00.670> them<00:01:01.120> as<00:01:01.360> keytars

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
how we could use them as keytars

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.120 
how we could use them as keytars
I've<00:01:02.260> got<00:01:02.649> this<00:01:02.770> old<00:01:03.010> late<00:01:03.789> 90s<00:01:04.800> synth<00:01:05.800> box

Dave's<00:01:09.220> been<00:01:09.460> finding<00:01:09.820> these<00:01:09.970> things<00:01:10.050> this<00:01:11.050> is

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
Dave's been finding these things this is

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.090 
Dave's been finding these things this is
like<00:01:11.470> a<00:01:11.500> Yamaha<00:01:11.770> mu<00:01:12.369> 10<00:01:13.560> sort<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.619> tone<00:01:14.830> bang

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
like a Yamaha mu 10 sort of tone bang

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
like a Yamaha mu 10 sort of tone bang
thing<00:01:15.630> I've<00:01:16.630> got<00:01:16.659> a<00:01:16.960> fiver<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.619> car<00:01:17.979> booster

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
thing I've got a fiver a car booster

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.770 
thing I've got a fiver a car booster
just<00:01:19.720> like<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.350> stuff<00:01:20.619> mate<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.220> think<00:01:21.780> so

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
just like it and stuff mate I think so

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.450 
just like it and stuff mate I think so
yes<00:01:22.900> we<00:01:23.140> thought<00:01:23.320> why<00:01:23.799> not<00:01:23.830> just<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.310> know

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
yes we thought why not just you know

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.270 
yes we thought why not just you know
smash<00:01:25.150> one<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.510> those<00:01:25.659> into<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.140> other<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
smash one of those into the other and

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.859 
smash one of those into the other and
see<00:01:27.490> what<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.729> get<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.180> turns<00:01:28.450> out<00:01:28.659> it's

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
see what you get and it turns out it's

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.370 
see what you get and it turns out it's
really<00:01:28.930> really<00:01:29.890> good<00:01:30.100> fun<00:01:30.390> I've<00:01:31.390> rigged<00:01:32.080> like

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
really really good fun I've rigged like

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.560 
really really good fun I've rigged like
a<00:01:32.409> massive<00:01:32.920> old<00:01:33.100> 9-volt<00:01:33.640> battery<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.390> back

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
a massive old 9-volt battery to the back

a massive old 9-volt battery to the back
of<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:37.060> keytar<00:01:37.720> control<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.350> just

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
of this and the keytar control that just

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.190 
of this and the keytar control that just
takes<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:39.100> haze<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.509> MIDI<00:01:40.689> out<00:01:40.869> from<00:01:41.140> the

takes a haze the MIDI out from the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.590 
takes a haze the MIDI out from the
keytar<00:01:41.590> goes<00:01:41.950> straight<00:01:42.460> into<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.939> Nord<00:01:43.240> and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
keytar goes straight into the Nord and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:55.630 
keytar goes straight into the Nord and
as<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.290> result

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640

you<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:09.020> sound<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.600> i<00:02:11.600> got<00:02:11.990> some<00:02:12.140> FM

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
you do sound on it and i got some FM

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.170 
you do sound on it and i got some FM
synthesis<00:02:13.070> going<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.580> they've<00:02:13.760> got<00:02:13.970> some

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
synthesis going on it they've got some

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.370 
synthesis going on it they've got some
MIDI<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.050> it

so<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> keytar<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.820> no<00:02:17.000> controlling<00:02:17.480> them<00:02:17.720> no

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so the keytar is no controlling them no

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.760 
so the keytar is no controlling them no
no<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.000> plan<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.450> stick<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.170> now<00:02:21.350> in

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
no and the plan is to stick the now in

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.000 
no and the plan is to stick the now in
some<00:02:22.160> spare<00:02:22.990> space<00:02:23.990> inside<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.650> keytar

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
some spare space inside the keytar

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
some spare space inside the keytar
housing<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.940> then<00:02:26.330> it's<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.660> be

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
