of duct tape or some contact paper she

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640 
of duct tape or some contact paper she
could<00:01:20.700> fix<00:01:20.880> anything<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> needed<00:01:22.500> in

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.500 

let's<00:02:23.440> say<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.800> together<00:02:25.590> turn<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:27.010> off<00:02:27.510> then

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
let's say it together turn it off then

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.120 
let's say it together turn it off then
turn<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:28.989> back<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:31.200> truly<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.319> fixes<00:02:32.680> at<00:02:32.830> least

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
turn it back on truly it fixes at least

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.850 
turn it back on truly it fixes at least
ninety<00:02:33.640> nine<00:02:33.819> percent<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.569> computer<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
ninety nine percent of computer and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
ninety nine percent of computer and
electronic<00:02:36.459> problems<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:40.390> my<00:02:41.200> bluetooth<00:02:43.110> had

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
electronic problems so my bluetooth had

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.729 
electronic problems so my bluetooth had
about<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.349> hundred<00:02:44.410> bucks<00:02:44.860> for<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:46.470> while<00:02:47.470> back

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
about a hundred bucks for it while back

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.120
