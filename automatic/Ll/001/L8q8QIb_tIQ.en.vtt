00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 ah 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.260
 very good kids we started with a 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.519
 new minecraft video and good in the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.110
 chapter today I'm going to tell you about a 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.789
 which is very brief but very 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.860
 interesting the truth is something that has 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.330
 surprised a lot as you will have seen in 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.270
 the title what we are going to see in the day 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.220
 today is therefore how can we 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.690
 check how many uses are left to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.350
 anything from minecraft that 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.329
 consume for example armor weapons what 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.649
 that is tools and others for it 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.350
 what I'm going to do is take a couple of 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.950
 things here in the creative and then I'll 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.870
 to be able 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.760
 I will put forgiveness in survival mode 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.770
 and in this way we will see how to activate 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.380
 the trick and how it works let's see I'm going 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.200
 to take for example sheep and I'm going to 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.149
 take for example some skeletons 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.610
 also what I'm going to catch is a weapon and 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.760
 an armor for example so a 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.969
 Diamond armor 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 a diamond sword and finally already 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.409
 some tool such as a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.840
 peak for example is worth a moment now 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.770
 let's put it like this in the first view 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.500
 ordinary person 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.720
 and let's see let's put it in mode 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 and survival is perfect then 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.700
 what I'm going to do before anything is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.110
 to piss a sheep and good as you see 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 still no bar appears in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.530
 our sword that I have selected 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.870
 but at the moment that I use it as 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.670
 you see there is a bar and how do you 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.110
 it has to rain justly 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.750
 now then we are going to deactivate a 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 second the rain to follow 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.470
 explaining this we will see there perfect 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.300
 we deactivate the rain and good as 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.130
 I always tell you that you are calling 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.690
 the attention any of the things that 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.490
 you are seeing as for example this that 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.110
 I just used this from here this 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.820
 there, all these things I have 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.290
 explained in previous videos so 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 if it's the first time you see one of my 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.580
 videos I recommend you go through 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.050
 previous videos or else on the channel there 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.149
 a playlist with all 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.710
 videos of this series and good without more 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.660
 procrastination we continued with what was 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.369
 explaining then good as you see 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.800
 a bar appears and if we 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.750
 we put on top of the sword simply 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.040
 the name appears and for a few 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 versions appears the damage that causes 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.480
 our weapon and the same for the rest of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.760
 things not everything is good let's go there I'll 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.260
 explain how to do so 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.269
 be able to know how many uses you have left is 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.780
 something very simple if we click 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.680
 f3 and without releasing f3 we give the key h 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.810
 now we give again to efe 3 and 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.790
 we enter the inventory as you see 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.010
 has been activated as an information 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.799
 additional on the one hand in parentheses 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.719
 the number of each one of the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.470
 elements with this number we 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:50.810
 we can invoke or not get 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.439
 as it is said of pool if in certain 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.180
 mode is as general or invoke this 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.470
 object through that code of the same 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.750
 way that we have done in chapters 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.220
 previous to get the block of 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.129
 commands that I think is a number to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.470
 137 because the sword is made of the same 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.069
 form but instead of 137 you will have to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.359
 put 276 so that's explained in 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.939
 previous chapters if someone 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.609
 It's interesting that you go through them and 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.409
 I say that there is a list of 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.280
 reproduction with all the chapters and 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.380
 also at the end 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.450
 of this video because I'll always put 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.370
 a link to the previous video but also 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.080
 that video also loads the list of 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.520
 reproduction so you're not going to have 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.010
 problems if you want to watch videos 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.650
 before and then below as you can see 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.959
 hard ability and that is what 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.330
 what is the video of today that is what 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.060
 the number of uses that are left to the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.989
 sword we have not once used the sword 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.810
 so from 1,161 has gone to 1,560 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.880
 It's worth the same thing I guess it will happen with 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.000
 the armor if we now generate 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.030
 for example an enemy such as a 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.100
 archer you see there shoots us and if now 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.360
 we consult this as you see 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.580
 has appeared there its the number of uses 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.880
 that he has to his credit, I'm going to end up with 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.190
 with this its duration not what what 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.340
 hold and the same with the peak if 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.250
 we chop for example a block 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 as you can see that is the block as you see 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.660
 it happens the same with the peak of 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.699
 iron both your code appears as 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.080
 appears the number of uses that you have left 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.460
 we have been once we still 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.280
 there are 249 left 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.740
 but good if for some reason you do not 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.289
 like this you get bored of using it or 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.819
 you simply want to deactivate it or 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.340
 you want to know how it was deactivated 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.020
 then leave it activated or not, then 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.960
 you simply have to do the same 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.970
 press f3 and while you press efe 3 h of 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.790
 again you can give the f3 so that no 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.070
 those numbers appear 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.770
 As you can see, that has disappeared 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.100
 information then it is very easy efe 3 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.320
 + h to bring up yf 3 + h so that 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.120
 disappear then as it is only active 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.090
 and if we deactivate without major problem and 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.590
 well I think that with this face of 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.270
 says that I have the truth I have 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.310
 four million arrows driven by 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.250
 the body I'm going to dismiss the truth is 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.500
 a short video but I also did not want 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.760
 were all the long videos because 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.260
 as you will have seen in the previous video 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.300
 good those who have seen it is 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.340
 interested this kind of 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.349
 of commands like the command can be 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.240
 play zone that requires a little 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.699
 more time is something a little more 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.229
 elaborated you will need to hear that 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.599
 fits a helicopter is passing by 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.639
 for my house will not be heard or not but 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.620
 well I was bothering a little and 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.139
 nothing said what I've done this video 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.970
 shorter because good the truth is that 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.250
 I found it very interesting although 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.229
 be something short and so alternate or 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.449
 more complex videos with more videos 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:49.000
 simple that as you can see this one 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.560
 active in a very easy way but what 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.090
 what it allows us to do is something that is 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.530
 very very interesting and that I think that 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.840
 I'm going to use from now on 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.030
 all my series or whenever you play 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.530
 this great game is not minecraft since 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.050
 in this way you can know everything 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.060
 what use is left now is , how many 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.919
 uses is left to my sword and then yes 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.139
 I want to repair it or whatever, because I can 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.639
 be attentive and it's not just with 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.919
 this bar that appears here below that 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.379
 it is so a bit imprecise and that at the end and 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.060
 we are never sure at 100 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.120
 per cent of how many uses it has left and 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.710
 well said that I do not roll up anymore and 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.030
 nothing that I hope you liked this 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.130
 video the truth I tell you to me has 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.480
 surprised very much this seems to me very 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.760
 curious about the way 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.680
 what is hidden is that combination of 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.230
 buttons and nothing that I'm happy 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.480
 very much for the support you are having 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.220
 this series and for the support that is 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.830
 having the other series in general in 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.720
 the channel and that nothing that thank you very much 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.460
 to see my videos and see you in 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.710
 next chapters of tricks 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.710
 minecraft so nothing goodbye
