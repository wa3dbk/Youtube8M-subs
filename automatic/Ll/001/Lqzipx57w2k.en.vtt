00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.420
Don't speak 'Dae'~

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.440
Cut out all the weird suffixes!

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.140
That's terrible way to speak Korean!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.500
Try it again!

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.860
She tries to speak as clearly as she can!

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.140
Way better than before!

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.080
You've got to absorb the meaning of the sentence clearly.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.180
Yup, we'll promise you.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.540
(He got shock with this boy's soulless acting!)

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.160
Try to sing 'Seoul song' as best as you can, don't read it like a sentence!

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.300
That's how you sing that song?Gosh~

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.900
Who wrote the script?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.560
She doesn't know the song at all!

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.620
They all don't know the song.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.300
You know it? Try then! Why didn't you teach her?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.480
Junsang will sing the song instead from now on.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.840
Look at your mom, she's so glad going to Seoul.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:58.260
Then..I'm...transferring school..again..

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.580
That's great...He's good at acting.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.800
How do you like his acting?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.420
The acting gets way better if you just think once more before acting out specific scene.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.820
These naive girls and boys got infinite possibilities to act well!

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.940
Dongil's last advice

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.140
You should know which role you are playing.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.220
Whatever role you are playing, you should change it into your style!

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.340
Don't try to change yourself to become specific character, but you'd better just be that character.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.760
Act sincerely, focus on the basics.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.660
Don't forget to talk outloud with someone and try to make eye contact when talking to someone.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.440
Then you'll be..

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.040
an actor that can earn money as muchn as I earn!

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.200
The big senior's sincere advice..

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.800
Teacher, thank you for your effort!
