modification when things don't quite go
to<00:00:37.020> plan<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.680> top<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:41.340> Stuart<00:00:41.940> Reed

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to plan so the top that's Stuart Reed

who's<00:00:42.450> doing<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> ramp<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.080> ramped<00:00:43.470> up<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
who's doing the ramp to ramped up the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.310 
who's doing the ramp to ramped up the
gap<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.030> 12<00:00:45.510> meters<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> can

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
gap there is 12 meters so you can

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320 
gap there is 12 meters so you can
visualize<00:00:46.710> how<00:00:46.739> far<00:00:47.220> it<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.460> he's<00:00:48.000> done<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
visualize how far it is he's done it

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.540 
visualize how far it is he's done it
successfully<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.129> minute<00:00:50.370> Dave

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
successfully and in a minute Dave

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.200 
successfully and in a minute Dave
Shannon<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.059> attempt<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> drive<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:53.000> car<00:00:54.000> on

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
Shannon will attempt to drive the car on

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.360 
Shannon will attempt to drive the car on
two<00:00:54.570> wheels<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.559> straight<00:00:56.160> which

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
two wheels all the way up straight which

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.190 
two wheels all the way up straight which
won't<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.879> easy<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.329> cars<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.930> online

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
won't be very easy these cars are online

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.470 
won't be very easy these cars are online
Gardiner<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:58.950> do<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.280> yeah<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.700> think<00:01:00.000> they

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
Gardiner to do that yeah I think they

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.880 
Gardiner to do that yeah I think they
might<00:01:00.720> be<00:01:00.780> doing<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.560> so<00:01:01.680> late

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
might be doing that it was so late

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
might be doing that it was so late
earlier<00:01:02.250> today<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:03.270> into<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> sand<00:01:03.899> this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
earlier today go into the sand this

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.540 
earlier today go into the sand this
morning<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.530> hasn't<00:01:04.830> had<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> particularly

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
morning he hasn't had a particularly
