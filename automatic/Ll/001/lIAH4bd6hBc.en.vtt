let's<00:02:23.209> say<00:02:24.050> you're<00:02:24.230> at<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.349> five<00:02:24.650> handed<00:02:25.010> table

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
let's say you're at a five handed table

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.229 
let's say you're at a five handed table
and<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.849> have<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> true<00:02:26.480> m<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.989> 12<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:28.700> calculate

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
and you have a true m of 12 to calculate

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.809 
and you have a true m of 12 to calculate
your<00:02:29.360> effective<00:02:29.930> m<00:02:30.190> multiplied<00:02:31.190> your<00:02:31.430> true

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
your effective m multiplied your true

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.100 
your effective m multiplied your true
m12<00:02:32.810> x<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.860> number<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.370> players<00:02:34.610> at<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.910> table

m12 x the number of players at the table
5<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.530> then<00:02:36.980> divide<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.580> answer<00:02:37.970> 60<00:02:38.450> x<00:02:38.900> 10<00:02:39.200> in

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
5 and then divide the answer 60 x 10 in

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.790 
5 and then divide the answer 60 x 10 in
