00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to work out because it's typically

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.290 
to work out because it's typically
something<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:41.730> never<00:00:41.969> think<00:00:42.180> about

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

African American women struggle with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
African American women struggle with
working<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.560> not

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
working out because we it's not

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.870 
working out because we it's not
something<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> we<00:01:11.310> traditionally<00:01:11.760> have

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
something that we traditionally have

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090 
something that we traditionally have
made<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> priority<00:01:12.619> my<00:01:13.619> priorities<00:01:14.070> are

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
made a priority my priorities are

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
made a priority my priorities are
typically<00:01:14.580> taking<00:01:14.820> care<00:01:15.000> families<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.049> know

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
typically taking care families you know

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
typically taking care families you know
work<00:01:16.530> those<00:01:17.070> kind<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.400> things<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.030> our<00:01:18.330> health

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
work those kind of things but our health

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
work those kind of things but our health
is<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.200> always<00:01:19.439> bottom<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> list<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
is is always bottom on the list and so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.300 
is is always bottom on the list and so
that's<00:01:21.090> something<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> change

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
that's something that we have to change

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
that's something that we have to change
starting<00:01:23.310> black<00:01:23.460> girls<00:01:23.729> run<00:01:23.970> definitely<00:01:24.630> was

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
starting black girls run definitely was

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.170 
starting black girls run definitely was
a<00:01:24.900> journey<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.950> first<00:01:26.490> started<00:01:27.000> we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
a journey when we first started we

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.370 
a journey when we first started we
thought<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.479> were<00:01:27.540> gonna<00:01:27.659> write<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> book<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thought we were gonna write a book that

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.550 
thought we were gonna write a book that
book<00:01:28.590> has<00:01:28.770> not<00:01:28.950> happened<00:01:29.159> yet<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
book has not happened yet we got a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410 
book has not happened yet we got a
little<00:01:31.860> derailed<00:01:32.159> when<00:01:32.640> we<00:01:32.759> started<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
little derailed when we started the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.030 
little derailed when we started the
writing<00:01:33.750> groups<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.590> started<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
writing groups and once we started the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.340 
writing groups and once we started the
writing<00:01:35.220> groups<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:36.270> literally<00:01:36.750> took<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
writing groups it literally took on a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.950 
writing groups it literally took on a
life<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.979> its<00:01:38.130> own<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.509> 70

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
life of its own so now we have 70

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
life of its own so now we have 70

back<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.410> that's<00:02:13.800> when<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> went<00:02:14.550> ahead<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
back and so that's when I went ahead and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.930 
back and so that's when I went ahead and
and<00:02:15.320> went<00:02:16.320> natural<00:02:16.470> hahaha<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.640> haven't
