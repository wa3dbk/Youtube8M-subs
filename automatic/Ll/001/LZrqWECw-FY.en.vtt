00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
what the Christian teachings were about

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.009 
what the Christian teachings were about
Jesus<00:03:03.380> walking<00:03:03.739> on<00:03:03.980> water<00:03:04.209> miracles<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.900> know

Jesus walking on water miracles you know

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.840 
Jesus walking on water miracles you know
what<00:03:06.170> if<00:03:06.410> God<00:03:06.650> told<00:03:06.829> me<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.130> kill<00:03:07.340> my<00:03:07.519> neighbor

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
what if God told me to kill my neighbor

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.420 
what if God told me to kill my neighbor
and<00:03:08.389> that<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> commandment<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.799> God<00:03:10.069> I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
and that was a commandment of God I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.849 
and that was a commandment of God I
probably<00:03:10.910> would<00:03:11.299> not<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.260> then<00:03:12.829> I

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
probably would not do it and then I

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.840 
probably would not do it and then I
would<00:03:13.010> suffer<00:03:13.549> this<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:15.190> sacrifices<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.340> not

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
would suffer this the sacrifices of not

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.550 
would suffer this the sacrifices of not
obeying<00:03:17.209> God<00:03:17.569> okay

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
obeying God okay

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.009 
obeying God okay

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
on the show yes the reason why I don't

believe<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.560> he's<00:03:48.950> telling<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.459> truth<00:03:49.489> it

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
believe that he's telling the truth it

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.240 
believe that he's telling the truth it
is<00:03:50.389> because<00:03:51.049> what<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.410> Word<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:51.680> God<00:03:51.739> says

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
is because what the Word of God says

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.180 
is because what the Word of God says
what<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.670> Bible<00:03:53.030> says<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:53.859> you<00:03:54.859> know<00:03:54.920> because

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
what the Bible says and you know because

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.759 
what the Bible says and you know because
God<00:03:55.370> says<00:03:55.639> in<00:03:55.790> his<00:03:55.819> word<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.540> God<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.530> Father

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
God says in his word that God the Father

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.759 
God says in his word that God the Father
is<00:03:58.329> he's<00:03:59.329> neither<00:03:59.569> male<00:03:59.870> nor<00:03:59.900> female<00:04:00.139> he's

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
is he's neither male nor female he's

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.220 
is he's neither male nor female he's
spirit<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.519> those<00:04:01.790> who<00:04:01.849> worship<00:04:02.030> Him<00:04:02.419> need<00:04:03.139> to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
spirit and those who worship Him need to

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.370 
spirit and those who worship Him need to
worship<00:04:03.620> Him<00:04:03.799> in<00:04:03.829> spirit<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.400> in<00:04:04.549> truth<00:04:04.840> so<00:04:05.840> if

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
worship Him in spirit and in truth so if

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.140 
worship Him in spirit and in truth so if
what<00:04:06.620> he's<00:04:06.799> saying<00:04:07.130> right<00:04:07.489> now<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:08.120> just

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
what he's saying right now it just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.539 
what he's saying right now it just
sounds<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:08.900> a<00:04:08.930> total<00:04:09.169> contradiction<00:04:09.889> to<00:04:10.250> me

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
sounds like a total contradiction to me

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.330 
sounds like a total contradiction to me
and<00:04:10.849> God<00:04:11.480> isn't<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.200> God<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.409> contradiction<00:04:13.099> he

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and God isn't a God a contradiction he

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.000 
and God isn't a God a contradiction he
doesn't<00:04:13.640> contradict<00:04:14.150> himself

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
doesn't contradict himself

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.949 
doesn't contradict himself
I<00:04:15.040> just<00:04:15.730> wanted<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.000> make<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:16.269> comment<00:04:16.570> first

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
I just wanted to make that comment first

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.990 
I just wanted to make that comment first
