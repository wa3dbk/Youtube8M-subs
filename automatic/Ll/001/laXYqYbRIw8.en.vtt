would<00:03:11.209> be

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.570 

yeah<00:03:15.260> go<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.530> objects<00:03:16.100> block<00:03:16.820> my<00:03:17.120> knees

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
yeah go to objects block my knees

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.230 
yeah go to objects block my knees
and<00:03:19.150> make<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.510> bigger<00:03:20.670> all<00:03:21.670> right<00:03:21.820> here<00:03:22.000> and

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
and make this bigger all right here and

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.590 
and make this bigger all right here and
I'm<00:03:22.720> going<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.960> search<00:03:23.080> for<00:03:23.350> fusion<00:03:23.650> coil

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
I'm going to search for fusion coil

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.940 
I'm going to search for fusion coil
there<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:26.910> copy<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.120> identifier

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.930

go on the hfc ctrl-f paste you need to

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.300 
go on the hfc ctrl-f paste you need to
go<00:03:38.090> through<00:03:39.099> hex<00:03:40.099> values<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.879> OH<00:03:42.099> search<00:03:43.099> it

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
go through hex values and OH search it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.790 
go through hex values and OH search it
and<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.540> some<00:03:44.720> fusion<00:03:44.959> coil<00:03:45.290> right<00:03:45.590> there

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
and that is some fusion coil right there

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.030 
and that is some fusion coil right there
it's<00:03:46.580> unique<00:03:47.050> you<00:03:48.050> will<00:03:48.200> find<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.709> any<00:03:48.890> other

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
it's unique you will find it any other

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.040 
it's unique you will find it any other
time<00:03:49.510> see<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:52.489> then<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:53.030> want<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.300> go<00:03:53.390> back<00:03:53.870> in

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
time see so then you want to go back in

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:04.250 
time see so then you want to go back in
the<00:03:54.140> Johnson<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:56.290> I'm<00:03:57.290> going<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.620> search<00:03:57.980> for

so here's a small flood AI right here

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:57.420 
so here's a small flood AI right here
that's<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> identifier

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.839 

you<00:04:58.430> only<00:04:58.580> copy<00:04:58.910> that

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849

and goat hxc right click and a sensor

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:13.799 
and goat hxc right click and a sensor
then<00:05:09.459> you<00:05:09.550> will<00:05:09.699> save<00:05:10.029> it<00:05:11.909> salvage<00:05:12.909> XD<00:05:13.389> and

then you will save it salvage XD and

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.589 
then you will save it salvage XD and
