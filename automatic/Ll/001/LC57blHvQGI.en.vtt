00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
it it's too curvy for me it looks good
at<00:01:45.790> certain<00:01:46.060> angles<00:01:46.330> I've<00:01:46.540> got<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.750> say<00:01:46.869> that

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
at certain angles I've got to say that

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.950 
at certain angles I've got to say that
237<00:01:48.310> brake<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:48.820> every<00:01:49.060> time<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.329> Drive<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.780> I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
237 brake and every time I Drive it I

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.399 
237 brake and every time I Drive it I
get<00:01:50.829> out<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.490> think<00:01:52.079> yeah<00:01:53.079> it's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
get out of it and just think yeah it's

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.560 
get out of it and just think yeah it's
fast<00:01:53.710> but<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.369> just<00:01:54.790> don't<00:01:54.970> get<00:01:55.060> involved<00:01:55.360> with

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
fast but I just don't get involved with

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.060 
fast but I just don't get involved with
it<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:56.110> hot<00:01:56.290> hatch<00:01:56.439> should<00:01:56.650> be<00:01:56.799> more<00:01:56.920> than

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
it and a hot hatch should be more than

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.319 
it and a hot hatch should be more than
that<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.400> should<00:01:57.430> be<00:01:57.670> visceral<00:01:58.030> she'll<00:01:58.210> be

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
that it should be visceral she'll be

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.090 
that it should be visceral she'll be
fingertip<00:01:59.079> stuff<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.560> should<00:01:59.740> feel<00:01:59.920> what

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
them in orange with great big stripes on

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.010

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it and they look quite hooky

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.070 
it and they look quite hooky
the<00:02:08.229> focus<00:02:08.590> has<00:02:08.680> got<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.950> good<00:02:09.070> combination<00:02:09.670> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the focus has got a good combination of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
the focus has got a good combination of
power<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.380> controls<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.430> also<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:12.790> dead

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
power with controls but also it's dead

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
power with controls but also it's dead
practical<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.540> mean<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.200> essentially<00:02:14.920> just

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
practical I mean it is essentially just

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.000 
practical I mean it is essentially just
the<00:02:15.250> focus<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.880> isn't<00:02:16.090> cheap<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.080> want<00:02:17.890> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the focus and this isn't cheap I want to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.110 
the focus and this isn't cheap I want to
talk<00:02:18.190> about<00:02:18.430> them<00:02:18.580> again

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
talk about them again

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.370 
talk about them again
can<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.660> show<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.020> thing<00:02:22.380> instead

than the old car and it's actually got

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.060
