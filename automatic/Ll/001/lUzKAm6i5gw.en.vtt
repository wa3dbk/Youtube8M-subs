okay<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.600> have<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.840> problem<00:00:04.200> with<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.770> quantum

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
okay I have a problem with the quantum

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.249 
okay I have a problem with the quantum
complete<00:00:06.330> PV<00:00:07.080> system<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:12.019> transmitter<00:00:13.019> no

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
complete PV system the transmitter no

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.320 
complete PV system the transmitter no
longer<00:00:13.710> works<00:00:14.610> after<00:00:15.389> about<00:00:15.690> 3<00:00:16.470> 15<00:00:16.800> 12<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.970> 15

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
longer works after about 3 15 12 to 15

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
longer works after about 3 15 12 to 15
minute<00:00:18.660> flights<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:21.980> think<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
minute flights I think it's the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.859 
minute flights I think it's the
transmitter<00:00:25.070> worked<00:00:26.070> fine<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.910> now<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.840> just

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
transmitter worked fine and now it just

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.950 
transmitter worked fine and now it just
stopped<00:00:28.500> working<00:00:32.600> looks<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.989> trying

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
stopped working looks like it's trying

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.160 
stopped working looks like it's trying
haven't<00:00:36.960> changed<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> channel<00:00:38.719> from<00:00:39.719> channel

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
haven't changed the channel from channel

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.450 
haven't changed the channel from channel
worked<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> 47<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.230> receiver<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.070> didn't

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
worked on 47 on the receiver and didn't

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.340 
worked on 47 on the receiver and didn't
change<00:00:44.760> any<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.190> channels<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
change any of the channels on the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.639 
change any of the channels on the
transmitter<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> first<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:51.649> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
transmitter from when I first got it you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.479 
transmitter from when I first got it you
can<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> i<00:00:55.289> unplug<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.039> transmitter

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
can see that if i unplug the transmitter

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.700 
can see that if i unplug the transmitter
battery<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:58.500> sending<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.370> kind<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> signal

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
battery it's sending some kind of signal

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.609 
battery it's sending some kind of signal
when<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> plugged<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.589> not<00:01:04.589> video<00:01:06.619> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
when it is plugged in but not video it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.520 
when it is plugged in but not video it's
just<00:01:08.900> static

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.219 

and<00:01:13.860> haven't<00:01:14.729> taken<00:01:14.940> this<00:01:15.180> antenna<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.750> since

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and haven't taken this antenna off since

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.149 
and haven't taken this antenna off since
I<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.770> first<00:01:17.760> got<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> out<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> box<00:01:19.159> since

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I have first got it out of the box since

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.010 
I have first got it out of the box since
I<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:22.190> so<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:23.850> burned<00:01:24.780> up

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
I put it on so I know it's not burned up

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
I put it on so I know it's not burned up
from<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.470> I've<00:01:25.799> read<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.040> there's<00:01:26.400> some

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
from that I've read that there's some

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.010 
from that I've read that there's some
problems<00:01:26.940> with<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:28.670> nope<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.540> using

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
problems with that but nope just using

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.490 
problems with that but nope just using
it<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.259> supposed<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.860> used<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.500> you're
