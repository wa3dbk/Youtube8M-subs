so I want to demonstrate its use

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.170 
so I want to demonstrate its use
this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> piece<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.990> cedar<00:00:38.030> that<00:00:39.030> we're

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
this is a piece of cedar that we're

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.490 
this is a piece of cedar that we're
gonna<00:00:39.300> run<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> little<00:00:40.320> rock

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
gonna run through it's a little rock

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770 
gonna run through it's a little rock
rock<00:00:41.010> over<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> side<00:00:41.539> frequent<00:00:42.539> on<00:00:42.600> this

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
rock over on this side frequent on this

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.689 
rock over on this side frequent on this
side<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.260> thicker<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.160> side<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> is

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
side but thicker on this side and it is

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.660 
side but thicker on this side and it is
than<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.539> side<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> piece

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
than it is on this side so for a piece

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.139 
than it is on this side so for a piece
like<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.260> what<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.379> need<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.739> first<00:00:50.280> adjust

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
like this what we need to first adjust

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.549 
like this what we need to first adjust
the<00:00:51.300> height<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> conveyor<00:00:52.079> beats<00:00:52.350> by<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the height of the conveyor beats by the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.330 
the height of the conveyor beats by the
thick<00:00:52.829> side<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> I'll<00:00:55.320> lower<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> compares<00:00:56.070> by

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
thick side so I'll lower the compares by

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.000 
thick side so I'll lower the compares by
tip<00:00:56.640> piece<00:00:56.969> pin<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.199> raise<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> up

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
tip piece pin and then raise it up

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.810 
tip piece pin and then raise it up
slowly<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:01.250> hear<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.519> drum

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
slowly it's going to just hear the drum

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:19.109 
slowly it's going to just hear the drum
making<00:01:03.239> contact<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> wood

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.590 

now<00:01:19.689> we're<00:01:20.289> ready<00:01:20.469> to<00:01:20.590> send<00:01:20.829> it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
now we're ready to send it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
really did a lot of sanding if I take to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.010 
really did a lot of sanding if I take to
mark<00:02:27.470> best<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:28.010> finish<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.400> off

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.950 

I<00:02:32.050> can<00:02:32.650> do<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> deep<00:02:33.460> swing<00:02:33.760> south<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.870> to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
I can do like a deep swing south so to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.930 
I can do like a deep swing south so to
go<00:02:35.140> ahead<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.440> turn<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.680> crank<00:02:35.800> no<00:02:36.130> quarter

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940

go ahead and turn the crank no quarter
turn

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:11.080 

like<00:02:59.489> maple<00:03:00.000> or<00:03:00.150> cherry

I<00:03:36.129> can't<00:03:37.120> wait<00:03:37.330> see<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.659> one

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
I can't wait see this one

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:52.380 
I can't wait see this one
he's<00:03:40.050> hit<00:03:40.349> the<00:03:40.380> second<00:03:40.980> president

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.470 

now<00:03:52.870> if<00:03:53.080> I<00:03:53.200> had<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> little<00:03:53.710> bit<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.270> had<00:03:55.450> a

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
now if I had a little bit if I had a

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.120 
now if I had a little bit if I had a
motor<00:03:55.870> they<00:03:56.110> had<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.320> little<00:03:56.560> bit<00:03:56.680> more<00:03:56.830> torque

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
motor they had a little bit more torque

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.840 
motor they had a little bit more torque
on<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.720> would<00:03:58.840> probably<00:03:59.080> eliminate<00:03:59.850> that's

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
on it it would probably eliminate that's

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.320 
on it it would probably eliminate that's
what<00:04:01.120> has<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.750> as<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:01.960> works<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.470> works<00:04:02.590> fine

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
what has it as it works it works fine

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.090 
what has it as it works it works fine
that's<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.390> problem<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:05.110> lot<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.470> times<00:04:05.590> on<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.890> run

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
that's a problem a lot of times on a run

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.980 
that's a problem a lot of times on a run
pieces<00:04:06.490> through<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.700> machine<00:04:07.030> I'll<00:04:07.570> have<00:04:07.840> my

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
pieces through the machine I'll have my

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.610 
pieces through the machine I'll have my
handout<00:04:08.440> up<00:04:08.710> on<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.490> beat<00:04:09.700> controller<00:04:10.620> and

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
handout up on this beat controller and

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.160 
handout up on this beat controller and
the<00:04:11.890> quads<00:04:12.190> down<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.460> little<00:04:12.670> bit<00:04:12.850> if<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.600> sensed

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
the quads down a little bit if I sensed

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.510 
the quads down a little bit if I sensed
you<00:04:14.290> know<00:04:14.410> if<00:04:14.500> it's<00:04:14.650> gonna<00:04:14.800> bog<00:04:15.040> down<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.310> little

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
you know if it's gonna bog down a little

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.710 
you know if it's gonna bog down a little
bit<00:04:15.610> too<00:04:15.760> much<00:04:16.230> I'll<00:04:17.230> adjust<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.769> speed<00:04:18.720> but

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
bit too much I'll adjust the speed but

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.620 
bit too much I'll adjust the speed but
yeah<00:04:19.840> that's<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.320> check<00:04:20.920> it<00:04:21.070> out<00:04:21.270> jig<00:04:22.270> shop
