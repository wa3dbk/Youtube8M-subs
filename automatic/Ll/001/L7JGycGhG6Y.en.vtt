hard<00:00:08.700> drives<00:00:09.000> are<00:00:09.290> magnetic<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.530> they<00:00:11.160> are

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
hard drives are magnetic and they are

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.490 
hard drives are magnetic and they are
more<00:00:11.610> stable<00:00:11.940> than<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.719> portable<00:00:13.349> magnetic

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
more stable than a portable magnetic

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.310 
more stable than a portable magnetic
device<00:00:14.460> like<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> zip<00:00:15.269> drive<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:15.780> floppy<00:00:15.990> drive

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
device like a zip drive or floppy drive

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950 
device like a zip drive or floppy drive
and<00:00:16.590> they<00:00:17.310> are<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:18.029> stable<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.720> flash

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and they are not as stable as a flash

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.900 
and they are not as stable as a flash
drive<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> needed<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.490> back<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
drive but if you needed to back up that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
drive but if you needed to back up that
much<00:00:21.210> data<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.689> would<00:00:21.810> probably<00:00:22.080> be<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.500> way

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
much data that would probably be the way

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.550 
much data that would probably be the way
to<00:00:22.619> go<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:23.760> make<00:00:23.939> fresh<00:00:24.300> scrubs<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:25.230> large

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
to go do they make fresh scrubs in large

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.160 
to go do they make fresh scrubs in large
not<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.849> capacity<00:00:27.060> they<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.630> go<00:00:27.869> up<00:00:27.900> into

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
not in that capacity they do go up into

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.950 
not in that capacity they do go up into
many<00:00:28.529> gigabytes<00:00:29.130> now<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> mean<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.720> find

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
many gigabytes now I mean you can find

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.720 
many gigabytes now I mean you can find
even<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> little<00:00:31.650> thumb<00:00:32.009> sized<00:00:32.279> ones<00:00:32.579> go

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
even just a little thumb sized ones go

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.139 
even just a little thumb sized ones go
up<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> 16<00:00:33.899> gigabytes<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.399> very<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.760> large

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
up to 16 gigabytes so very very large

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
up to 16 gigabytes so very very large
there<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.870> starting<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.320> actually

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
there and they are starting to actually

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.010 
there and they are starting to actually
create<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.399> called<00:00:38.489> solid<00:00:39.059> state<00:00:39.420> hard

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
create what are called solid state hard

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.900 
create what are called solid state hard
drive<00:00:40.350> which<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.829> basically<00:00:41.040> hard<00:00:41.640> drives

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
drive which are basically hard drives

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.760 
drive which are basically hard drives
made<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.629> flash<00:00:42.899> memory<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.649> right

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
made out of this flash memory all right

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.310 
made out of this flash memory all right
I'm<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.700> there's<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.450> leading

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I'm they are there there's the leading

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.170 
I'm they are there there's the leading
edge<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.559> things<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.760> future

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
edge of things that's going to be future

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.970 
edge of things that's going to be future
yeah<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.629> definitely<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.649> starting<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
yeah you definitely are just starting to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.060 
yeah you definitely are just starting to
see<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.250> show<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.730> lewes<00:00:51.530> there<00:00:52.530> they're

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
see it show up in lewes there they're

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.810 
see it show up in lewes there they're
literally<00:00:53.430> brand<00:00:53.789> new<00:00:54.379> movie<00:00:55.610> look<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.670> could

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
literally brand new movie look I could

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
literally brand new movie look I could
just<00:00:56.910> trying<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.239> backup<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.840> obviously<00:00:58.199> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just trying to backup is obviously it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.049 
just trying to backup is obviously it's
one<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> biggest<00:00:58.949> problems<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
one of the biggest problems that this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
one of the biggest problems that this
existing<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:00.989> computer<00:01:01.320> city<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.949> lot

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
existing in computer city because a lot

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
existing in computer city because a lot
of<00:01:02.250> things<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> itself<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.090> backup<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of things in itself but backup is one of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.090 
of things in itself but backup is one of
those<00:01:04.530> things<00:01:04.589> where<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> be

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
those things where you have to be

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
those things where you have to be
conscious<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.150> computer<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
conscious about the computer want to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
conscious about the computer want to
take<00:01:06.780> care<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
take care of it for you so if you have a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.550 
take care of it for you so if you have a
terabyte<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.659> pictures<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.470> movies

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
terabyte of you know pictures or movies

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160 
terabyte of you know pictures or movies
of<00:01:10.830> personal<00:01:11.220> did<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.909> can't<00:01:12.119> replace<00:01:12.420> really

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of personal did you can't replace really

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
of personal did you can't replace really
the<00:01:13.260> only<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.979> safe<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.400> be

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the only way to be safe is to be

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
the only way to be safe is to be
redundant<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.540> other<00:01:15.659> words<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.080> more<00:01:16.439> than

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
redundant in other words have more than

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910 
redundant in other words have more than
one<00:01:16.920> copy<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.000> their<00:01:18.150> system<00:01:18.540> heats<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:19.140> okay

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
one copy so their system heats up okay

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.570 
one copy so their system heats up okay
you<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.580> 1.5<00:01:21.330> terabyte<00:01:21.780> today<00:01:22.400> it<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
you know 1.5 terabyte today it is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
you know 1.5 terabyte today it is
similar<00:01:24.110> when<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> write<00:01:25.860> video<00:01:27.470> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
similar when you have to write video is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
similar when you have to write video is
definitely<00:01:28.710> run<00:01:29.250> flash<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.729> they're<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.030> as

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
definitely run flash but they're not as

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640 
definitely run flash but they're not as
far<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> solid<00:01:30.960> state<00:01:31.110> drives<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.470> they're

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
far as a solid state drives know they're

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
far as a solid state drives know they're
going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> require<00:01:32.430> too<00:01:32.610> expensive<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.390> near

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
going to require too expensive the near

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.230 
going to require too expensive the near
future<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.229> make<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> feasible<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.970> really

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
future to make that feasible so really

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
future to make that feasible so really
the<00:01:36.360> best<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.259> set<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> system<00:01:38.040> where

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the best way is to set up a system where

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
the best way is to set up a system where
you<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.880> multiple<00:01:39.240> archives<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.650> did

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you have multiple archives and I did

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.530 
you have multiple archives and I did
what's<00:01:40.950> called<00:01:41.009> mirroring<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.060> when<00:01:42.420> you're

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
what's called mirroring so when you're

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
what's called mirroring so when you're
right<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:42.990> hour<00:01:43.110> drive<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.680> sit

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
right to one hour drive it right sit

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
right to one hour drive it right sit
back<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.250> completely<00:01:45.149> redundant<00:01:45.619> copy<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
back up completely redundant copy the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.109 
back up completely redundant copy the
same<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.700> under<00:01:48.000> master<00:01:48.240> drive

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119
