full-contact<00:00:39.620> hardware<00:00:40.340> again<00:00:40.640> what<00:00:40.820> we're

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
full-contact hardware again what we're

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.340 
full-contact hardware again what we're
talking<00:00:41.240> about<00:00:41.300> is<00:00:41.540> getting<00:00:41.810> as<00:00:41.900> much<00:00:42.080> of<00:00:42.260> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
talking about is getting as much of the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.080 
talking about is getting as much of the
stream<00:00:42.620> transference<00:00:43.400> through<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.670> body<00:00:43.880> of

stream transference through the body of
the<00:00:44.180> guitar<00:00:44.620> this<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.740> a<00:00:45.770> pv<00:00:46.220> palladium<00:00:46.700> base<00:00:46.910> I

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
the guitar this is a pv palladium base I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.210 
the guitar this is a pv palladium base I
got<00:00:47.330> this<00:00:47.450> a<00:00:47.510> number<00:00:47.720> of<00:00:47.900> years<00:00:48.050> ago<00:00:48.410> nice

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
got this a number of years ago nice

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.040 
got this a number of years ago nice
affordable<00:00:49.550> base<00:00:50.000> got<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.300> nice<00:00:50.480> neck<00:00:50.750> place

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
affordable base got a nice neck place

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.230 
affordable base got a nice neck place
well<00:00:51.350> but<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:51.950> full<00:00:52.130> contact<00:00:52.550> hardware<00:00:53.030> on<00:00:53.210> it

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
well but the full contact hardware on it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.110 
well but the full contact hardware on it
so<00:00:54.080> I<00:00:54.110> get<00:00:54.350> as<00:00:54.440> much<00:00:54.650> sustained<00:00:55.190> as<00:00:55.490> much<00:00:55.730> tone

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
so I get as much sustained as much tone

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.200 
so I get as much sustained as much tone
as<00:00:56.720> much<00:00:56.960> engaged<00:00:57.410> stability<00:00:58.040> as<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.820> can<00:00:59.000> get

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
as much engaged stability as I can get

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.150 
as much engaged stability as I can get
out<00:00:59.360> of<00:00:59.480> this<00:00:59.570> guitar<00:00:59.990> no<00:01:00.620> matter<00:01:00.800> where<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.070> am

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
out of this guitar no matter where I am

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:11.990 
out of this guitar no matter where I am
on<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.490> fingerboard

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.220 

and<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> want<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> talk<00:01:13.200> about

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
and what I want to talk about

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.370 
and what I want to talk about
specifically<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.750> ease<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> operation

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
specifically is the ease of operation

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920 
specifically is the ease of operation
with<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.400> Hardware<00:01:17.910> specifically<00:01:18.690> how<00:01:18.870> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
with this Hardware specifically how you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.040 
with this Hardware specifically how you
can<00:01:19.320> set<00:01:20.100> your<00:01:20.250> intonation<00:01:20.520> precisely<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
can set your intonation precisely and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.780 
can set your intonation precisely and
how<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.710> set<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.070> string<00:01:23.400> height<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
how you can set your string height to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.360 
how you can set your string height to
exactly<00:01:24.300> where<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.690> want<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> be<00:01:25.370> okay

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
exactly where you want it to be okay

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.500 
exactly where you want it to be okay
we're<00:01:26.520> talking<00:01:26.670> about<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.910> full<00:01:27.090> contact

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
we're talking about the full contact

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.150 
we're talking about the full contact
hardware<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.140> happens<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.410> be<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> gold<00:01:28.860> for

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
hardware this happens to be a gold for

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.060 
hardware this happens to be a gold for
string<00:01:29.490> base<00:01:30.140> unit<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> pv

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
string base unit and it's on a pv

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
string base unit and it's on a pv
palladium<00:01:32.580> base<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.690> thing<00:01:33.840> that's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
palladium base and the thing that's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.570 
palladium base and the thing that's
really<00:01:33.990> nice<00:01:34.260> about<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.800> one<00:01:35.040> once<00:01:35.400> it's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
really nice about it is one once it's

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.010 
really nice about it is one once it's
set<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.910> can<00:01:36.030> lock<00:01:36.210> everything<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.840> place

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
set you can lock everything in place

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
set you can lock everything in place
keep<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.440> very<00:01:37.560> stable<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.280> locking<00:01:38.729> screw

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
keep it very stable so the locking screw

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850 
keep it very stable so the locking screw
is<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.050> left<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> saddle

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
is this one to the left of the saddle

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460 
is this one to the left of the saddle
I'm<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.880> g<00:01:42.180> string<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
I'm just going to do g string for now so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
I'm just going to do g string for now so
I'm<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> unlock<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> watch

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I'm going to unlock it and if you watch

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
I'm going to unlock it and if you watch
this<00:01:45.810> cam<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.040> how<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> set

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this cam this is how I'm going to set

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
this cam this is how I'm going to set
the<00:01:47.820> string<00:01:48.149> height<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.750> Drive<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.229> set

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the string height as I Drive that set

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.490 
the string height as I Drive that set
screw<00:01:49.740> down<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.220> cam<00:01:50.460> turns<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.200> lifts

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
screw down the cam turns and it lifts

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.650 
screw down the cam turns and it lifts
the<00:01:52.530> string<00:01:53.009> okay<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.270> get<00:01:54.540> it

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
the string okay you can see I can get it

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.260 
the string okay you can see I can get it
a<00:01:54.690> nice<00:01:55.050> little<00:01:55.380> action<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.000> higher

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a nice little action and get a higher

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
a nice little action and get a higher
action<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.899> get<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.200> set<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.410> wherever<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.830> want
