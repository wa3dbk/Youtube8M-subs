the side of the deck when you're at rest

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.590 
the side of the deck when you're at rest
so<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> there's<00:01:23.369> no<00:01:23.520> chance<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.479> would

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so that there's no chance that you would

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.109 
so that there's no chance that you would
be<00:01:24.720> flashing<00:01:25.080> cards<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> person<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.490> trying

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to peek at a card yourself so the thumb

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.520 
to peek at a card yourself so the thumb
would<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.790> dead<00:01:30.090> across<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.140> side<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.670 
would be dead across the side of the
deck<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.950> let's<00:01:32.159> take<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> look<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> actual

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
deck but let's take a look at the actual

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
deck but let's take a look at the actual
motion<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.799> pitching<00:01:35.600> cards<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> player<00:01:37.290> or

some<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.799> you<00:03:48.980> might<00:03:49.189> find<00:03:49.219> this<00:03:49.549> more

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
some of you might find this more

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.009 
some of you might find this more
comfortable<00:03:50.150> than<00:03:50.299> others<00:03:50.540> if<00:03:50.719> you've<00:03:50.840> been

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
comfortable than others if you've been

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.890 
comfortable than others if you've been
arrested<00:03:51.230> before

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
arrested before

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.330 
arrested before
I've<00:03:53.900> been<00:03:54.139> handcuffed<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.739> few<00:03:54.919> times<00:03:55.129> in<00:03:55.310> my

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
I've been handcuffed a few times in my

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.520 
I've been handcuffed a few times in my
life<00:03:55.459> I'm<00:03:55.760> not<00:03:55.879> talking<00:03:56.209> about<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.659> was<00:03:56.810> much

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
life I'm not talking about it I was much

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.659 
life I'm not talking about it I was much
younger<00:03:57.560> at<00:03:57.949> the<00:03:58.010> time<00:03:59.199> and<00:04:00.370> that's<00:04:01.370> what<00:04:01.579> the

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
younger at the time and that's what the

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.349 
younger at the time and that's what the
pitch<00:04:01.849> looks<00:04:02.090> like<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:04.849> also<00:04:05.030> do<00:04:05.239> the

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
pitch looks like you can also do the

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.659 
pitch looks like you can also do the
same<00:04:05.680> analogy<00:04:06.680> with<00:04:06.889> a<00:04:06.919> rubber<00:04:07.189> band

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
same analogy with a rubber band

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.709 
same analogy with a rubber band
rather<00:04:08.359> than<00:04:08.629> handcuffs<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:10.540> that's<00:04:11.540> what

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
rather than handcuffs but that's what

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.959 
rather than handcuffs but that's what
the<00:04:11.810> pitch<00:04:11.989> looks<00:04:12.530> like<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:13.250> are<00:04:13.430> pitching

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:13.969 
the pitch looks like you are pitching

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.689 
the pitch looks like you are pitching
the<00:04:14.269> card<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.750> actually<00:04:15.560> spinning<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.220> with

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
the card and actually spinning it with

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.400 
the card and actually spinning it with
the<00:04:16.820> index<00:04:17.150> finger<00:04:17.239> keep<00:04:17.720> in<00:04:17.900> mind<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.259> you

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
the index finger keep in mind that you

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.279 
the index finger keep in mind that you
don't<00:04:18.590> want<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.799> pitch<00:04:19.009> too<00:04:19.310> high<00:04:19.549> because<00:04:20.539> you

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
don't want to pitch too high because you

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.170 
don't want to pitch too high because you
can<00:04:21.470> actually<00:04:21.680> then<00:04:22.009> read<00:04:22.310> those<00:04:22.580> cards<00:04:23.030> in

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
can actually then read those cards in

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.920 
can actually then read those cards in
midair<00:04:23.599> and<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:25.729> becomes<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.180> major<00:04:26.419> advantage

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
midair and it becomes a major advantage

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.680 
midair and it becomes a major advantage
in<00:04:27.259> a<00:04:27.620> game<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.830> poker<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.759> know<00:04:28.940> if<00:04:29.210> the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
in a game of poker if you know if the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.230 
in a game of poker if you know if the
other<00:04:29.810> opponents<00:04:30.320> know<00:04:30.440> each<00:04:30.560> other's<00:04:30.830> cards

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
other opponents know each other's cards

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.139 
other opponents know each other's cards
now<00:04:32.240> let's<00:04:32.479> get<00:04:32.630> me<00:04:32.780> out<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:32.930> these<00:04:33.080> cuffs
