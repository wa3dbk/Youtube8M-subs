00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
my opinion this is the best SMG in the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
my opinion this is the best SMG in the
game<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.340> best<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.670> comes<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
game it's not the best when it comes to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.390 
game it's not the best when it comes to
damage<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> range<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.500> recoil<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.249 
damage and range and recoil and all that
stuff<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.880> does<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> pretty<00:01:21.570> high<00:01:21.750> amount

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
stuff it does have a pretty high amount

stuff it does have a pretty high amount
of<00:01:22.320> recoil<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> taller<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.610> mean<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
can deal with the recoil as long as you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.380 
can deal with the recoil as long as you
have<00:01:25.799> decent<00:01:26.310> thumbs<00:01:26.549> you're<00:01:27.030> gonna<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.330> able

to<00:01:27.540> control<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> recoil<00:01:28.080> look<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.740> those

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
to control the recoil look at all those

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.850 
to control the recoil look at all those
assists<00:01:29.520> on<00:01:29.700> getting<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.299> fucking

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
assists on getting from my fucking

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.880 
assists on getting from my fucking
overall<00:01:31.860> vsat<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.049> reason<00:01:34.229> why<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> mp7

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
overall vsat so the reason why the mp7

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.580 
overall vsat so the reason why the mp7
in<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.340> opinion<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> best<00:01:35.939> SMG<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:37.140> because

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
in my opinion is the best SMG is because

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.109 
in my opinion is the best SMG is because
it<00:01:37.710> has<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.860> bigger<00:01:38.280> clip<00:01:38.610> than<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> rest<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it has a bigger clip than the rest of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.749 
it has a bigger clip than the rest of
the<00:01:39.210> SMGs<00:01:39.630> except<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> PDW<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> also

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the SMGs except for the PDW but it also

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
the SMGs except for the PDW but it also
has<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.659> high<00:01:42.750> rate<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> fire<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
has a really high rate of fire so it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.069 
has a really high rate of fire so it
kills<00:01:44.250> people<00:01:44.610> pretty<00:01:44.850> damn<00:01:45.030> fast<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
kills people pretty damn fast and you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
kills people pretty damn fast and you
can<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.380> silencer<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.860> fast<00:01:47.100> mags<00:01:47.399> without

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
can use silencer and fast mags without

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.340 
can use silencer and fast mags without
worrying<00:01:48.090> about<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.899> having<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
worrying about you know having to have a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.749 
worrying about you know having to have a
secondary<00:01:49.770> weapon<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.310> already<00:01:50.549> has

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
secondary weapon because it already has

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.280 
secondary weapon because it already has
40<00:01:51.149> bullets<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.570> cliff<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> already

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a lot of people are calling the best SMG

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.850 
a lot of people are calling the best SMG
the<00:01:56.700> MSMC<00:01:57.210> which<00:01:57.600> has<00:01:57.780> 30<00:01:58.020> rounds<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.409> clip<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the MSMC which has 30 rounds and clip it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
the MSMC which has 30 rounds and clip it
does<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> better<00:01:59.790> damage<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.390> slow<00:02:00.630> rate<00:02:00.840> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
does have a better damage a slow rate of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
does have a better damage a slow rate of
fire<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.409> kills<00:02:01.649> people<00:02:01.950> faster<00:02:02.340> has

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
fire but it kills people faster has

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.520 
fire but it kills people faster has
better<00:02:02.820> range<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.320> more

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
better range and a little bit more

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.160 
better range and a little bit more
manageable<00:02:04.649> recoil<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
manageable recoil but you get in

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410 
manageable recoil but you get in
positions<00:02:07.649> where<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:09.030> kill<00:02:09.239> more

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
positions where it's like if I kill more

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.820 
positions where it's like if I kill more
three<00:02:09.599> people<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> don't<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> secondary<00:02:10.679> to

quick tip i would suggest using guns

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.470 
quick tip i would suggest using guns
that<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.160> most<00:02:23.190> ammo<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.970> clip<00:02:24.210> you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that have the most ammo in the clip you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.060 
that have the most ammo in the clip you
know<00:02:24.570> based<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.080> rate<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.260> fire<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
know based on the rate of fire but the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.560 
know based on the rate of fire but the
more<00:02:26.280> ammo<00:02:26.640> you're<00:02:27.000> gonna<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.420> more

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
more ammo you're gonna have the more

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.180 
more ammo you're gonna have the more
rounds<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.110> clip<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.560> think<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> better

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
rounds in one clip I think the better

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.530 
rounds in one clip I think the better
off<00:02:29.340> we're<00:02:29.490> gonna<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:29.970> then<00:02:30.300> in

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
off we're gonna do because then in
