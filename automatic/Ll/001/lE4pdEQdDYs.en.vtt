side<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.610> luckily<00:01:26.610> right<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.119> walk<00:01:27.330> in

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
side and luckily right as I walk in

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
side and luckily right as I walk in
there's<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> sign<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> says<00:01:28.259> no<00:01:28.590> clothing

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
there's a sign that says no clothing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.240 
there's a sign that says no clothing
allowed<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.720> thinking<00:01:31.100> well<00:01:32.100> at

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
allowed and so I'm thinking well at

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.690 
allowed and so I'm thinking well at
least<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.640> holds<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:35.250> walk<00:01:35.460> into

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
least that holds that and I walk into
