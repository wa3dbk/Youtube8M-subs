00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 my name is buddhism nice that you watch this video 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.740
 I've made a video a few times this month about the lines and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.229
 that is because many people are doing things 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.059
 I wanted to lend a hand 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.589
 why 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.460
 it's that I was talking to a few people and then it was also about hot 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.029
 but it often does not work for employees 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.880
 and why work volt point move to a plan in which he stated yes 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.869
 he immediately notices the difference between 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.329
 The word Live Cell Dieting is something that people often turn their heads 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 have this was the tahrir square yet there is a goal have been reached and then go 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.100
 she about to 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.410
 well a normal way of eating not normal level food led to 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.090
 weight gain 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.090
 so the arm chances it will happen again afterwards 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.409
 You can only achieve lasting success through your body 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.540
 to change permanently 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 that is a close one but perhaps more important 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.430
 and we have to go to the gym and yourself 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.260
 finish off 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.440
 this is a very many fallen a wall 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.260
 for yourself 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 yes i am not choosing any other word than this 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.620
 the penalties 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.450
 it's a tough approach 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 and you don't make this easy for yourself 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 beyond the pain threshold you deny things that you 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.660
 would like to eat 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.410
 in short, you rarely make yourself punishable and you could say 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.770
 that is not a loving approach to yourself 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.580
 and that is why, in my opinion, it has no chance of success in the longer term 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 the only way you 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.540
 staying yourself 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.060
 can make you healthy 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.100
 can also be approached lovingly by the self 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.400
 and you would draw parallels with it 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.240
 with children 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.920
 on fewer trains 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.450
 the children they are learning 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 we can do the hard work by punishing them and setting up sanctions 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.440
 and 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.590
 there's a lot to do 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.799
 fined with in the hands of pocket money or maybe even this to give the traffic jams 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.469
 but sometimes that is also possible as a father 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:12.629
 Every dad had to know mom too that in the end that's not the way around you 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.729
 children 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.310
 positive behavior 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.069
 what you will then have to spend is mainly Oostende confirmation 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.069
 yes and 9 and also make it feel good 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.199
 has very good effects on itself 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.619
 seen at them brentford for borrowing around their legs 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:30.749
 well is again 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.220
 returns to her pen 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.199
 marcel changes 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.779
 choose to postpone 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.809
 cherish your own body 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.059
 where life is good 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.159
 we can enjoy 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.569
 and that is, for example, the propaganda I myself am 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.319
 the switch can be quite difficult as you will indeed have a number 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.919
 things are going to tell us 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.079
 what you love 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.219
 whether the agency will also release meat or milk 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.379
 but I have the feeling that you may be temporarily punishing yourself 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.400
 but if I guided you like this you can do it your own way but if I do you 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.449
 would guide and make decisions in the bud and courses, for example 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.409
 on which obama draw 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.370
 then I will go with you looking for all they feel what species 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.370
 vegetable food types but you can enjoy them immensely 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.939
 no I am what you like 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.170
 m there you therefore do not need a limited you no longer useful 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.409
 width even stronger 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.829
 wipes on eaten usually do not immediately occur much more immediately 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.529
 the pessemier carlyle although that sometimes also includes animal feed 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:35.749
 so you can even rather just join italy vague not to forget so pass 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.389
 also choose the food chain 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.959
 what you love 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.769
 And that you must also have a difficult PhD 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.779
 so don't go eat things you don't like 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:47.119
 but sweet things that you replace on the spot from club you can 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.409
 enjoy not being ahead of katie 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.589
 and that way 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:51.620
 create and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620
 a kind of loving environment for yourself 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.819
 and it will be 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.529
 also not difficult to sustain 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.639
 but could also be a positive 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.069
 we have a 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.069
 sometimes be able to build the new one 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.500
 what improved me health and therefore negative emotions 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.449
 also led to top 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.449
 holding yes 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.309
 do not make technical with the long wapper 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:22.129
 Negative emotions lead to bad health positive emotions 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.740
 cause 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.629
 wilfried tsonga who is the first conversation 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:26.919
 the scientist 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.840
 said president neighborhood function logic component confirm and south 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.789
 it is a distance shown if you 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.180
 They have positive feelings and have a good chance of getting into good liquor 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.669
 to watch the film and a comic film 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.910
 then this is how your body's highest sacrifice is without effort 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.379
 well that the hope that they now also that secret there is also the users so 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.000
 know vegetable or if your body sets 0 off for other worries that it 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.990
 nice is that it is nice that you can enjoy it of course makes you happy 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.190
 and then the end is the loving approach to your body 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.199
 and that will also bear fruit 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.490
 so choose if you go 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.559
 I already said I choose health 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.879
 it's for me 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:12.900
 such a 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.840
 vegetable possible so also reach coda but choose that is perhaps 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.719
 participate in such an important message 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.400
 and maybe at the top 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.110
 choose the loving way 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.120
 cherish your league by taking care of your body that's for that 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120
 that it is good for you 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.770
 for it remains for the mind 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.719
 for the environment 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.719
 choose sweet that is actually just on the debate 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.919
 for the build 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.040
 endlessly repeating what i am that full of i am very excited about this 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.620
 has grasped me I see it constantly around reality people 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.339
 who dare to 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:47.400
 try it 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.300
 doesn't try to get away from it 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.300
 hey i think you won't regret it 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.780
 they were good at looking at you 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.749
 grouse 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.139
 I do not know intend to get food at the plantation the point of hell 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.189
 A free course can often meet each other on the plant from the company only for free 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:06.939
 and of course its busy 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.499
