attractive<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:24.290> what<00:03:24.650> I'm<00:03:24.739> thinking<00:03:25.129> of

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
attractive but what I'm thinking of

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.220 
attractive but what I'm thinking of
doing<00:03:25.250> is<00:03:25.670> adding<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.450> another<00:03:27.049> little

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
doing is adding just another little

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.900 
doing is adding just another little
piece<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.769> leather<00:03:27.980> right<00:03:28.489> down<00:03:28.670> here<00:03:28.849> a

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
piece of leather right down here a

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.849 
piece of leather right down here a
little<00:03:28.970> circle<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.629> leather<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.620> these

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
little circle the leather that these

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.240 
little circle the leather that these
would<00:03:31.040> go<00:03:31.190> through<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.849> hold<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.690> and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
would go through and and hold on to and

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.909 
would go through and and hold on to and
putting<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.549> on<00:03:34.879> it<00:03:37.060> I've<00:03:38.060> had<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:38.989> for<00:03:39.859> a

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
putting this on it I've had it for a

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.940 
putting this on it I've had it for a
while<00:03:40.069> there's<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.150> stretch<00:03:41.780> held<00:03:42.139> on<00:03:42.319> by<00:03:42.500> screw

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
while there's a stretch held on by screw

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.339 
while there's a stretch held on by screw
and<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.910> thought<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.359> myself<00:03:44.389> you<00:03:44.989> know<00:03:45.139> how
