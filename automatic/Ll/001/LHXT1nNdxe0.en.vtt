00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello everyone with you gameplay first on 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.069
 Today gram is called chuck change 3d this 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.349
 the game made for from the game but in the market but 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.420
 compatible with mine but so i also 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.580
 can you set yourself who haven't 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 tiger and calmly play her she 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.900
 free available let's see 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.880
 what is this hole and in general I did not understand 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.080
 What does the trick because graphics here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 normal nothing special and I do not know 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
 developers people wanted to want 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.460
 so it can be promoted in 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 Basically, the toy is good now 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.260
 see for yourself all the missions 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.820
 completely different this puzzle in 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.730
 which you need to reach 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.710
 portal for a short time and so time 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.050
 will start only when we start 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.820
 to play here on the board to consider 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 using a virtual joystick and what 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.920
 the best thing is that he appears in 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.050
 anywhere on the screen wherever you are 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.449
 would click 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.890
 so let's try to pass the commission I 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.930
 already passed it and now approximately 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.339
 I'll try to go through it quickly here. 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.010
 in addition to such here 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.970
 missions where you need to click on 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.850
 buttons there are emissions where you need more 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.040
 correct, probably how to say 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 move 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.130
 platforms various different cubes for 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.250
 to clear the way 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.560
 there are also bridges here 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.229
 fall after you pass on them 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 so doze in this game you do not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.750
 will have to but if you still fall from 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.409
 the edges of the map you will not lose but there is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.850
 return button but if you click on 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.250
 her then how do you say lose just 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.250
 time but the game continue so here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.920
 already completely new yet similar 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.170
 I saw but the meaning is immediately clear that 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 necessary on the yellow platform 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 place the yellow cubes in order 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.670
 go on in principle a good arcade 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.430
 good puzzle i love like 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.920
 games and very glad that such here 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.229
 the toy came out and appeared and will 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.640
 please me some time yet 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.800
 it will not pass or until we 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.270
 Do not get tired of the second game called drag 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.910
 racing four by four 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.040
 this is basically normal yes ok racing but 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.920
 all cars are licensed here that is 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.260
 here you see i have in real 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.200
 moment touareg is the original machine 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.930
 all have such as was originally 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.770
 what we have even have a UAZ it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.880
 hunter on from volkswagen touareg 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.340
 nissan patrol 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.709
 ford in general there is a lot of 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.190
 machines and they are all licensed here in 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.410
 principle 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.000
 ford explorer sport very 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.370
 nice is a miracle 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.130
 so let's go back and take a look at myself 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.050
 gameplay we start the race 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.480
 Naturally you can upgrade. but 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.540
 We do not and will most 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.580
 cool that at the beginning of the game first 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.860
 How to say a chapter is a chapter in Russia and 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.920
 We play in Russia, respectively, and in 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.440
 first race we went against UAZ 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.840
 Hunter and in principle its enough 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.790
 easily and quickly kicked the way in the second 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.790
 the race turns out we are also going about 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.049
 against UAZ on Tuareg 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.540
 naturally i think touareg should 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.410
 win and so on UAZ think in the end 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.079
 of this chapter 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.180
 but in Russia, I mean these UAZ will 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.160
 just crazy probably with nitrogen with 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.430
 forced engines and so on 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.040
 it won't be easy to win them 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.930
 the graphics here are basically good but how 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.180
 tell you nothing special here 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.160
 the usual drag racing car supposedly rides 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.500
 quickly 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.180
 flashes his location basically nothing 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.030
 no need to do except 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.730
 switch speeds first gas 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.070
 for the most effective start who 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.620
 likes drag racing download maybe 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.320
 the game you like 3 game called 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.440
 stick mobile wounds and there are two types 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.540
 games single and multiplayer think on 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.890
 it makes no sense to single 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.230
 then the usual runner in which you 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.600
 will need to jump and do 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.790
 tackles and under various obstacles here 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.030
 on multiplayer i recommend you 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.019
 take a look and now show it to you so 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.269
 now 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.449
 us gizmos players it may take about 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.270
 minutes when I played to review the players 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.810
 very quickly found and so it should 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.699
 click too raid and yes unfortunately we 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.550
 there will be only one contender on in first 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.919
 since I played with three at once, that's enough 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.310
 interestingly tapa on the right side of the screen 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.860
 we jump top on the left side of the screen 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.560
 we roll everything here 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.870
 obstacles in the form of various boxes in 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.710
 the form of various chainsaws which 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.599
 must be avoided and overcome them in 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.940
 principle that's pretty interesting here if 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.819
 if there were no multiplayer here , then I would 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.909
 counted the game just a waste and not 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.949
 worthwhile and show you but here 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.720
 thanks to multiplayer multiplayer and 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.750
 load on the site and make it very 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.389
 interesting and dynamic because you 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.150
 the hunt to choose and conquer all all 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.159
 rivals and be the coolest in 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.560
 general here is such a runner about our 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:19.569
 beloved and minimalist stickman and 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.780
 the average gram today is called engri 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.090
 monster's is a regular timekiller in 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.880
 which you will come to but will have a lot 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.610
 press your screen many times 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.130
 devices so i got to third of the mission 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.560
 then canned food is all about 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.870
 food and we need these 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.240
 protect food from monsters 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.789
 who will attack you and so 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.130
 our task is to destroy 20 blue 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.819
 Monsters before were tasks too 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.650
 destroy a certain number of monsters 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:53.889
 hold on a certain number of minutes 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.279
 seconds and so on the meaning of the game 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.039
 elementary we tap on the monsters we kill 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:02.680
 thus we are passing a mission 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.029
 Here is a simple toy that is 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.300
 principle will serve you excellent 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:09.669
 timekiller I probably today 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.740
 say goodbye to everyone thank you very much for your 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.219
 attention soon comes out 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.469
 asphalt 8th place not mistaken August 8 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:20.759
 I hope the release on android will not postpone 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:23.650
 really looking forward to it all until we meet again 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.199

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:35.770
 and I also think it will be your other 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:39.059
 All is still interesting to the colleagues
