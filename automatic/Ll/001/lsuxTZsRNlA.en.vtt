00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello to all of you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.290
 killer cities I hope you go 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 well in any case my day very very 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.040
 very well and today we will make a 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.849
 little test of this case so the sharkoon 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.599
 tactical x 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.340
 s7 it's a headphone gamer so I 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.360
 already made a video a boxing on 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.010
 so if you have not seen it I you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.130
 invite to click or video for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 go see this beautiful singing 7th boxing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 excuse me so today we will do 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 a little test I show you a little 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.480
 little what we can have with so we go 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.920
 talk a little bit about comfort in a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.579
 first time in a second time to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 talk about the sound then the microphone and finally the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 of the connectivity wi and I was going to say the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.489
 wiring but hey it works too 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.149
 so we'll be right back 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.149
 the comfort part 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.170
 so for the part that we 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 strong of this helmet I will tackle two 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.920
 three little things to say it's very 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.750
 fast so we have a foam that 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.129
 surrounds all the helmet the asset the hoop 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.500
 all that will be on your head 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.570
 so I think they have 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.930
 considered also for the distribution of 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.769
 weight because thanks to its padding ben it 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.030
 does not hurt 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.050
 I know that with some cases what they 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.190
 we stay too long in the process of 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.930
 to play low it hurts us at the top of the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.729
 head is very embarrassing I find me 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.280
 I had a newt and 720 and after a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.350
 moment it was doing that to me so with this 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.990
 that this game was only 4 1 I believe 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.009
 no problem is no problem 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.660
 really very nice and beats for for 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.399
 it's really great it's 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.110
 distributed it feels almost not good 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.160
 sure against 4h when you take it off you 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.080
 still feel that there is something that 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.179
 dream of your head that's for sure 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.800
 but good at the level of the distribution of 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.330
 weight on the arch is really very 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.950
 very good headphones they have very good 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.259
 think about it is the Germans 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.050
 so we'll do the German clichÃ© but 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.890
 good still still now we're going 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.940
 talk a little bit about the foam that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.409
 surrounds the atria 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.020
 so it's a foam that has to 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.130
 to make about 1 cm so it's very very 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.880
 sweet indoor we also have a 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.050
 red star so that's what is it 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.759
 actually separates everything that is part 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.090
 metal of your rice for not that 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.700
 touch 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.470
 good finally all the helmets long 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.080
 but hey I wanted to clarify 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.479
 so this is then comfort level very 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.580
 very much his idols not completely 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.989
 however, it is not 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 completely isolated at the same time you do not 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.920
 say it's not that bad when 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.290
 yells at you if for example you 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 to say at table we're going down even 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.190
 that's more and better and of course if 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.750
 you put the sound in the case that you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.180
 hear nothing more you'll hear just 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.010
 the game it's really great practice 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.330
 then comfort level it's over 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.540
 now we're going to talk a little bit about 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.540
 his 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.500
 so I could not I could not 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.880
 excuse me talk about the sound not to mention 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.200
 this little box 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.970
 so it's him who will allow us 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.700
 to have a sound of very good quality 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.980
 it is a case sci so if you 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.960
 have seen boxing videos of newts 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.210
 and all that you still have a case 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.280
 especially with the tritton ax 720x pro I 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.600
 know that with the 880 there is not you 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.700
 always have a case that you 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.860
 allow to actually have a sound in 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.090
 dolby digital so it's really very 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.440
 it was very good of you 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.200
 blue earth is for now what is 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.250
 better on the market so this case he has 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.230
 full of functions there are plenty of 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.620
 buttons by the way so there are plenty of 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.240
 buttons power volume up shutter berne m en 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.410
 dolby 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.350
 so there are a lot of things on it 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.640
 and therefore low and it's thanks to this 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.380
 thing we are going to see a very good sound 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.910
 so with this headset plugged on 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.650
 really gets a very very sound 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.390
 good quality 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.370
 good of course it's going to be a helmet with 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.000
 a sound a little bit lower a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.950
 triton 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.330
 I know that the trident with a whole 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.360
 a little under a little bit 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.250
 above but well after that goes a little bit 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.780
 equalize at the level of strengths and 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.640
 weaknesses of some helmets 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.560
 so for that one at the sound level 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.830
 it's a very good quality sound 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.110
 sure these islands in you the price besides 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.190
 I specify 129 euros 1 good for those 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.360
 who knew they did not watch the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.500
 boxing video so so for 129 euros 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.740
 really it's something very 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.840
 well 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.730
 you have a sound that is well distributed 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.920
 everywhere there is not one and one 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.020
 speaker in the middle and then 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.670
 it's good for 500 dolby of which there are 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.070
 two headphones on the side it is rather 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.960
 healthy souk is well distributed of course 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.580
 so here are levels are judy it's 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.600
 really a good sound so now we 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.600
 will talk a little bit of the microphone 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.500
 so to talk about the mic I got 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.630
 told the fact that I was not really going 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.919
 tell you about the mic itself I got 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.450
 says that the best way to you 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.950
 show a little bit the quality of the microphone 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.330
 it was just doing you a 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.100
 record which I will not to me t 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.350
 yes it has a great sound great game you 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.280
 pass a thunderstorm audio istremont so there 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.780
 you will hear a little 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.820
 recording where I talked to everything from 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.800
 following then I am currently on my 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.650
 pc and as you can see the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.330
 microphone sound and a good quality a 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.340
 really very nice to listen to me I 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.990
 I think the microphone is really 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.200
 great so there is not really any 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.750
 hissing whispers I think that 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.700
 for for skype for the ps3 to play 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.860
 with your imba talks with your friends 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.630
 it's really a good micro report 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.830
 quality price which is very very good so 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.110
 here we are right away to 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.700
 following then after hearing 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.229
 the audio recording where I think that 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.419
 you will understand that it is a very good 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.290
 microphone seriously on a microphone that is 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.000
 very good quality 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.639
 so after that we'll talk a little bit about 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.320
 the material of this micro so we can 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.880
 actually see a metal fiber 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.169
 so it's not plastic it's a 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.750
 meta again a little bit the train of 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.430
 no matter how so for example if 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.590
 you eat at the same time as you play 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.120
 you can tweet it in coconut 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.050
 who can eat all the time finally 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.200
 they say they recognize each other so yes 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.700
 this micro really a flexible branch 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.310
 so in fact you can do a little 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.680
 anything with that is good 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.060
 thing is so as you can 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.650
 the time anywhere I tell you that 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.330
 you will ever I think the case 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.100
 it's right in the middle of course the 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.590
 fragile points will be at the level of 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.850
 jack connectivity and at the level of 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.010
 micro of course do not have fun at 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.110
 turn fifty thousand times the microphone 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.510
 but after all I think that's pretty much 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.010
 all the same microphones so here at 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.169
 level of the microphone I think we did a 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.600
 little bit around so a branch in 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.570
 to be very very practical for a small 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.550
 little there m as we want and then in sounds 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.930
 who I think is of very good quality 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.530
 so now we're going to talk a little 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.530
 few connections 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.669
 so for 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.069
 talk about the cable so it's also very 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.800
 fast so we have like you 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.689
 can see the case here then the 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.030
 cable only headphones that is plugged 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.400
 so on the cable I did not specify 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.000
 it's about four meters so very 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.159
 good length 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.710
 I think it's sometimes a little 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.439
 great to have a cable like that so 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.259
 we have the optical cable plugged into 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:39.020
 the ps3 so this one is going to be for the 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:41.419
 sound of the game then we have the cable 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.389
 feeding what is plugged into the 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.250
 ps3 and at the same time it serves for the sound 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.690
 of your microphone so that people on 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.060
 the ps3 hear you so it's the same 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.349
 on xbox so that's actually it's 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.699
 something very simple you will have 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.580
 there are not many trucks ac 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.979
