00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
let's see should all be genetic stripes

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
let's see should all be genetic stripes
there<00:00:21.779> should<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> combination<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.830> suns

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
there should be a combination of suns

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.509 
there should be a combination of suns
and<00:00:23.519> normal<00:00:23.910> genetics<00:00:24.300> sons<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.519> Ohio's

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and normal genetics sons and Ohio's

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.290 
and normal genetics sons and Ohio's
Paulo<00:00:27.510> vinyls<00:00:27.990> all<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:30.060> one

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
Paulo vinyls all up so that this one

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.229 
Paulo vinyls all up so that this one
looks<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.599> little<00:00:30.630> weak

yeah<00:00:39.950> looks<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.040> it'll<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.340> okay<00:00:41.670> but<00:00:41.879> it's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
yeah looks like it'll be okay but it's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.920 
yeah looks like it'll be okay but it's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
three color phases so we've brought two

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:08.690 
three color phases so we've brought two
labs<00:01:58.910> together

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.710

I'm<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.730> breaking

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
I'm just breaking

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
I'm just breaking
oh<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:49.490> red<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.970> rich<00:02:50.800> beautiful<00:02:53.350> well<00:02:54.350> like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
oh the red is rich beautiful well like

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.949 
oh the red is rich beautiful well like
now<00:02:55.160> purple<00:02:55.760> supers<00:02:56.090> we<00:02:56.240> have<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.510> wait<00:02:56.690> until

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
now purple supers we have to wait until

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.750 
now purple supers we have to wait until
they<00:02:57.110> shed<00:02:57.410> almost<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.010> first<00:02:58.220> time<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.580> tell

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.100 
they shed almost the first time to tell
if<00:02:58.910> their<00:02:59.060> purple<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.540> because<00:02:59.720> they're<00:02:59.900> so

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
if their purple is because they're so
