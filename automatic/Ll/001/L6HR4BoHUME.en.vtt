absolutely crazy another example what

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.229 
absolutely crazy another example what
you<00:02:31.349> can<00:02:31.500> use<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.890> use<00:02:32.010> catalyst<00:02:32.519> shadow<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
you can use can use catalyst shadow and

you can use can use catalyst shadow and
if<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.569> lower<00:02:33.840> coiling<00:02:34.260> them<00:02:34.349> out<00:02:34.500> try

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
if you have a lower coiling them out try

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.369 
if you have a lower coiling them out try
and<00:02:35.129> go<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.370> hawk<00:02:35.640> engine<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.629> also<00:02:36.930> anchors

and go with hawk engine and also anchors

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.500 
and go with hawk engine and also anchors
also<00:02:37.709> good<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.099> as<00:02:38.250> well<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.940> going<00:02:39.360> into

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
also good one as well so going into

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.539 
also good one as well so going into
number<00:02:39.870> three<00:02:40.170> we<00:02:40.349> using<00:02:40.650> squad<00:02:40.920> fitness<00:02:41.310> cars

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
number three we using squad fitness cars

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.699 
number three we using squad fitness cars
this<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.879> also<00:02:42.299> similar<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.750> chemstar<00:02:43.290> cards

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
this is also similar to chemstar cards

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.770 
this is also similar to chemstar cards
however<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> lot<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:45.030> easiest<00:02:45.569> oh

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
however this is a lot more easiest oh

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.690 
however this is a lot more easiest oh
and<00:02:46.049> there's<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.349> lot<00:02:46.560> more<00:02:46.590> there's<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> bet<00:02:47.519> as

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and there's a lot more there's a bet as

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.550 
and there's a lot more there's a bet as
a<00:02:47.730> bare<00:02:48.000> chance<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.720> prices<00:02:48.959> going<00:02:49.319> back

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
a bare chance of the prices going back

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.530 
a bare chance of the prices going back
up<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:49.980> what<00:02:50.129> we<00:02:50.190> want<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.730> go<00:02:51.299> and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
up so what we want to do is go and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.670 
up so what we want to do is go and
search<00:02:51.840> gold<00:02:52.910> 151<00:02:53.910> or<00:02:54.120> 150<00:02:54.780> 300<00:02:55.079> somewhere

minimum price and max price 1k and the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.550 
minimum price and max price 1k and the
reason<00:03:51.480> why<00:03:51.569> this<00:03:51.599> method<00:03:52.169> is<00:03:52.260> probably

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
reason why this method is probably

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.920 
reason why this method is probably
better<00:03:52.799> than<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.129> gold<00:03:53.370> 150<00:03:54.150> coin<00:03:54.389> method<00:03:54.810> is

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
better than the gold 150 coin method is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.420 
better than the gold 150 coin method is
because<00:03:55.319> you<00:03:55.470> could<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.620> bidding<00:03:56.069> on<00:03:56.160> more

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
because you could be bidding on more

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.759 
because you could be bidding on more
high<00:03:56.669> price<00:03:57.060> players<00:03:57.419> and<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.199> why<00:03:58.440> it's

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
high price players and this is why it's

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.860

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
after that only slightly i don't think

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.600 
after that only slightly i don't think
they<00:04:43.720> go<00:04:43.870> up<00:04:43.990> too<00:04:44.290> much<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.530> course<00:04:44.950> but<00:04:45.400> going

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
they go up too much of course but going

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.360 
they go up too much of course but going
very<00:04:46.060> near<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.600> end<00:04:46.780> off<00:04:47.020> if<00:04:47.200> 14<00:04:47.710> now<00:04:47.920> so

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
very near to the end off if 14 now so

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.830 
very near to the end off if 14 now so
there's<00:04:48.550> less<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:48.850> less<00:04:48.910> people<00:04:49.030> wanting<00:04:49.660> to

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
there's less and less people wanting to

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.960 
there's less and less people wanting to
build<00:04:50.110> really<00:04:50.590> big<00:04:50.830> squads<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.430> this<00:04:51.790> will

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
build really big squads and this will

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.790 
build really big squads and this will
mean<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.330> prices<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.140> demand<00:04:53.650> of

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
mean that the prices and the demand of

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800 
mean that the prices and the demand of
players<00:04:54.070> will<00:04:54.580> start<00:04:54.850> to<00:04:55.000> drop<00:04:55.270> so<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.570> price

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
players will start to drop so the price

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.900 
players will start to drop so the price
won't<00:04:56.200> go<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.410> as<00:04:56.680> high<00:04:56.890> as<00:04:57.130> they<00:04:57.580> were<00:04:57.700> before

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
won't go to as high as they were before

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.430 
won't go to as high as they were before
that's<00:04:58.330> why<00:04:58.480> those<00:04:58.690> people<00:04:58.930> are<00:04:59.200> selling

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
that's why those people are selling

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.470 
that's why those people are selling
their<00:04:59.470> cards<00:04:59.950> now<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.760> we're<00:05:01.150> going<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.300> move
