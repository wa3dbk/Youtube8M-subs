cents we were at see how we can get it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.690 
cents we were at see how we can get it
going<00:01:30.540> again

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.590 

one<00:01:38.330> again<00:01:38.659> now<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.939> beauty<00:01:41.299> of<00:01:41.330> this<00:01:41.540> system

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
one again now the beauty of this system

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.620 
one again now the beauty of this system
is<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.110> losses<00:01:42.680> are<00:01:42.830> very<00:01:43.159> very<00:01:43.520> few<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.270> in

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
is that losses are very very few and in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.719 
is that losses are very very few and in
the<00:01:44.720> rare<00:01:44.930> case<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.380> do<00:01:45.619> get<00:01:45.799> lost<00:01:46.130> more<00:01:46.490> to

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
the rare case you do get lost more to

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:57.359 
the rare case you do get lost more to
its<00:01:47.240> quickly<00:01:47.840> quickly<00:01:48.290> made<00:01:48.649> up<00:01:48.860> we<00:01:49.670> won<00:01:49.850> again

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.830 

all<00:01:58.369> right<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:58.970> right<00:01:59.119> there<00:01:59.330> we<00:01:59.420> have<00:01:59.450> loss

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
all right so right there we have loss

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.990 
all right so right there we have loss
I'm<00:02:00.799> gonna<00:02:00.920> show<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.130> how<00:02:01.310> quickly<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.850> is<00:02:01.939> to

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
I'm gonna show you how quickly it is to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.960 
I'm gonna show you how quickly it is to

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
make it up without ever ever betting too

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:13.570 
make it up without ever ever betting too
much<00:02:10.600> there<00:02:11.600> you<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.530> made<00:02:13.489> my

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
much there you go just just made my

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.610 
much there you go just just made my
money<00:02:13.790> back<00:02:14.030> plus<00:02:14.330> more<00:02:14.600> without<00:02:15.200> ever

money back plus more without ever

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.320 
money back plus more without ever
bending<00:02:15.860> too<00:02:16.160> much<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.880> really<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.299> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
bending too much and that really is the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.470 
bending too much and that really is the
beauty<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.810> his<00:02:18.019> system

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.660 

one<00:02:24.080> again<00:02:26.769> this<00:02:27.769> is<00:02:27.950> not<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.280> martingale

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
one again this is not the martingale

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.080 
one again this is not the martingale
system<00:02:29.060> we're<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.480> doubling<00:02:30.050> up<00:02:30.230> after<00:02:30.590> that

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
system we're not doubling up after that

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.600 
system we're not doubling up after that
one<00:02:32.090> again<00:02:35.980> obviously<00:02:36.980> we're<00:02:37.129> winning<00:02:37.310> very

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
one again obviously we're winning very

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.440 
one again obviously we're winning very
little<00:02:38.000> but<00:02:39.730> extensive<00:02:40.730> research<00:02:41.000> can<00:02:41.269> show

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
little but extensive research can show

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.839 
little but extensive research can show
