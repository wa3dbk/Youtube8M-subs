00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.660
 in this work I would like to mention 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.089
 an alternative or complementary resource 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.370
 in the psychological evaluation it is 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.860
 of the self-drawing test 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.290
 the form of administration is simple 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.779
 but it is important that it be in sequence 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.330
 as well as the person in the rain 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.009
 complements the information at the most 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.919
 deep drawing of the human figure 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.419
 in terms of defensive processes and 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.509
 psychopathological that may be 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.930
 underlying the proposal of the drawing of 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.020
 himself will bring us the relationship 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.910
 between the projected image or 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 ideal and the real image that the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.550
 subject is to say in the self test 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.620
 we see how the person perceives himself 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.739
 how do you really feel what your 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.399
 concerns motivations and their status 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.129
 of current psychosomatic equilibrium how 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.409
 is the sequence of administration is 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.710
 you must first manage the drawing of the 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.510
 human figure then the drawing of the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.820
 person under the rain if you opt for 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.460
 manage it 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.110
 and finally the drawing of yourself is 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.290
 say first we tell the person 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.420
 to draw a person and then a 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.970
 person under the rain and finally that 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.310
 draw yourself 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.340
 those of the elements that are taken from 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.220
 analyzes are comparative for example is 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.380
 important to see the characteristics and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.670
 drawing styles that is all that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 they make the formal guidelines and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 contents that are presented in the drawing 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.370
 of the human figure that the difference is 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.010
 that basically what what gives us 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.140
 account the drawing of the human figure are 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.780
 as the person is positioned in the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.850
 current environment and in more aspects 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.570
 linked to pre-conscious contents 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.550
 conscious is to say how it stands as 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.560
 how it relates to the context in the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.899
 here and now 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.299
 when looking at this drawing for example that 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.220
 corresponds to the first stage of this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.470
 process that is the drawing of the figure 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.200
 human we can see that it is a 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.790
 small drawing located at the angle 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.769
 lower left 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.870
 which presents as characteristics 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.109
 highlighted the addition of accessories 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.480
 background as are the clouds and the sun 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.719
 placed symmetrically the floor very 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.549
 Overflowing over the wave - shaped 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.670
 figure has a predominance of straight lines 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.040
 and rigid in both the face and the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.140
 body let's say the curved elements that 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.129
 appear on the feet and on the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.010
 hands this would give us account for example 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.370
 of a more passive current positioning 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.290
 more contemplative 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.680
 there are feelings of instability 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.939
 affective 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.799
 and pockets of anxiety and worry 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.709
 the characteristic the rigid drawing speaks 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.269
 that adaptation is formal that can 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.340
 have some trait of hostility in 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.340
 relation to the position of the arms 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.410
 dependence also in relation to the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.650
 middle line of the drawing 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.989
 but symmetrically it's a drawing 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.390
 like my valence because when plotting 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.319
 The line of symmetry predominates 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.060
 right but the drawing is located in 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.650
 the left location since there are 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.780
 a need to project more 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.790
 actively in the environment but there 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.489
 still personal issues that do not 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.810
 have been able to elaborate the small drawing no 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.810
 is realizing that there is 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.530
 a lower profile a lower need 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.360
 of expansion in the environment nonetheless 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.710
 however let's say the desire to 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.710
 settle in it 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.320
 see what happens now with the drawing of 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.720
 itself 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.490
 that's why I told you at the beginning that 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.160
 it's a very interesting technique because 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.660
 as well as the drawing of the figure of the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.450
 person under the rain we can 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.950
 see the psychological stability and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.990
 emotional of the person to see the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.700
 drawing quality that is preserved 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.930
 that is modified good is a subject that 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.590
 we have also worked on others 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.960
 materials 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.670
 in this case here the self in front 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.480
 the subject to their actual current reality 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.210
 let's say to say it in some way 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.300
 that we see here in comparison 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.400
 increases the fund does not keep the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.330
 asymmetry of these two clouds and the sun in 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.630
 the center generates new elements 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.630
 trees mountains on the right the ground 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.530
 it's the same wavy but the figure is 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.470
 does micro graphic and lying down the person 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.380
 when he tells his story he says that 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.920
 is told say sitting under a 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.320
 tree reading and reflecting on the 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.690
 life and about his doing in life 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.020
 then that is exactly in 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.060
 the position of our aspect was that 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.180
 has transmitted us 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:08.090
 then there is this dynamic 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.520
 these focuses of anxiety are maintained 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.770
 concerns in relation to the 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.740
 current vital situation 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.080
 is presented we said that in the drawing of 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.910
 the person needs to project more 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.560
 to the right but is positioned to 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.690
 the left from this lack of 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.310
 balance the internal asymmetry and here 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.490
 we see what happens on the right 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.840
 there are obstacles 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.289
 they are figures of strokes and angular shapes 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.180
 also located in the angle 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.430
 lower right what gives that there 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.770
 hostile feelings compressed 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.830
 contained emotions 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.080
 the need to add so much bottom both 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.900
 you will both know the need for security of 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.330
 protection and obviously there is a 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.860
 underlying depressive since the figure 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.139
 lie down is lying down and has 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.539
 diminished even of its small size has 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.819
 past a micrographic size so 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:07.429
 we can both suspect that in this case 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:09.800
 there is this a content or a state 

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:12.319
 depressant 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.460
 and a situation let's say it's more of 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:19.630
 of expectation 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:24.240
 and of lack let's say of a much action 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.610
 more initiative in the environment 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.819
 the wavy soil not only that is 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.759
 wavy but there are several lines it 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:35.740
 add several lines which gives many 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.919
 feelings of insecurity 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.680
 and affective instability as a 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.060
 concern for reality is so much 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.590
 that the floor goes from side to side and 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.389
 usually overflows when they appear 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.180
 these so long soils is like the 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:52.870
 need that the person has to have 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.150
 under control but obviously in this 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.710
 let's say, feelings of 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.260
 sensitivity 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.930
 there are small pastures also that add up 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.780
 difficulties in everyday life as 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:08.860
 we see these latent elements as soon as 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.050
 to depression and a state of regression 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.320
 more meditative about reality 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.290
 current difficult prospecting 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.450
 Regarding the future, it remains as latent and 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.640
 it was not in evidence 2 in the drawing of 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.650
 the person is why we consider 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.200
 that this technique is very important in the 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.940
 clinical field in the forensic case by 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.940
 example when assessing psychic damage 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.490
 in the vocational field is for 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.680
 just see how it is perceived 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.509
 teenager or the consultant who is 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.509
 doing the orientation regarding his 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:45.680
 current life its feeling its strengths its 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:45.680
 feelings of weakness
