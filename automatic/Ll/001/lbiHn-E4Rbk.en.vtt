torch<00:02:19.510> which<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.080> quite<00:02:20.350> useful<00:02:20.700> obviously

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700

the<00:02:21.940> power<00:02:22.060> button<00:02:22.450> I've<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:22.750> pressed<00:02:22.930> there

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the power button I've just pressed there

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.320

there's a little button to control the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.540 
there's a little button to control the

not<00:02:31.150> terribly<00:02:31.600> bright<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.290> would<00:02:32.470> say

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
not terribly bright but I would say

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.790 
not terribly bright but I would say
fairly<00:02:32.890> useful<00:02:34.260> looking<00:02:35.260> around<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.530> rest<00:02:35.710> of

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
fairly useful looking around the rest of

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.890 
fairly useful looking around the rest of
the<00:02:35.860> handset<00:02:36.430> nothing<00:02:37.180> ready<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> speak<00:02:37.690> of

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the handset nothing ready to speak of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.810 
the handset nothing ready to speak of
there<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> here<00:02:38.980> at<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.190> bottom<00:02:39.490> here<00:02:39.670> with

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
there is a here at the bottom here with

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.630 
there is a here at the bottom here with
a<00:02:39.850> couple<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.180> connectors<00:02:40.660> so<00:02:40.990> possibly<00:02:41.640> there

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
a couple of connectors so possibly there

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.920 
a couple of connectors so possibly there
would<00:02:42.760> be<00:02:42.790> an<00:02:42.940> accessory<00:02:43.270> where<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.780> can

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
would be an accessory where we can

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.690 
would be an accessory where we can
actually<00:02:44.050> plug<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.500> into<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.920> dock<00:02:45.400> or

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
actually plug it into like a dock or

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually plug it into like a dock or
something<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.170> can<00:02:47.260> actually

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
something like that so we can actually

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.720 
something like that so we can actually
charge<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:49.060> we<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.890> socket<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.130> power

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
charge it then we have socket for power

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.180 
charge it then we have socket for power
cable<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.840> then<00:02:53.200> socket<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:53.710> the<00:02:53.800> headphone

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
cable and then socket for the headphone

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.650 
cable and then socket for the headphone
socket<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.820> been<00:02:55.210> something<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
socket that been something for the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.230 
socket that been something for the
headphones<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.800> then<00:02:57.580> on<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.820> back<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.210> have

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
headphones and then on the back we have

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.580 
headphones and then on the back we have
a<00:02:58.830> button<00:02:59.880> now<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.180> idea<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.960> button<00:03:02.530> on

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
a button now the idea of the button on

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.620 
a button now the idea of the button on
the<00:03:02.680> back<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.670> Douro<00:03:03.910> is<00:03:04.210> hearing

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the back is that the Douro is hearing

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.360 
the back is that the Douro is hearing
aid<00:03:04.750> compatible<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.920> will<00:03:06.100> work<00:03:06.310> with

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
aid compatible so that it will work with

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.630 
aid compatible so that it will work with
hearing<00:03:06.760> aids<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.740> also<00:03:08.740> on<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.250> along

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
hearing aids and also on that along

I suppose the only criticism I would

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.310 
I suppose the only criticism I would
perhaps<00:03:48.190> make<00:03:48.520> of<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:48.940> handset<00:03:49.420> on<00:03:49.600> initial

perhaps make of the handset on initial
inspection<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.000> display<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:53.020> quite

inspection is that the display is quite

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.730 
inspection is that the display is quite
small<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.950> comparison<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.700> keys<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.740> would

small in comparison to the keys I would

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.450 
small in comparison to the keys I would
perhaps<00:03:57.340> expect<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.180> have<00:03:58.330> had<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:59.140> know

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
perhaps expect to have had you know

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
see the keypad for example so quite

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.870 
see the keypad for example so quite
useful<00:05:36.510> will<00:05:37.320> comment<00:05:37.830> a<00:05:37.889> little<00:05:38.220> bit<00:05:38.400> more<00:05:38.699> we
