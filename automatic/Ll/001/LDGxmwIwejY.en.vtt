recommend if you can't find one go to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.080 
recommend if you can't find one go to
your<00:00:34.380> store<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.739> ask<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> reserve<00:00:35.880> one

for you it doesn't cost any money and it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970 
for you it doesn't cost any money and it
takes<00:00:39.150> only<00:00:39.570> maybe<00:00:39.840> 30<00:00:40.110> seconds<00:00:40.470> at<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> most
