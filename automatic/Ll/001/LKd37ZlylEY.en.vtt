00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello together i would be with this 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.740
 Video like the aqua of the vortex 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.049
 Thank you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.499
 I was in the last year on the 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.749
 Minerals fair at yours a system 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.570
 bought with triple rock crystal and 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.130
 Simply filtering to drinking water we 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.019
 I get the same I want to like 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.179
 show the filter first 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.380
 I turned off the water 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:31.949
 Cartridge immediately take out 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.260
 that's a filter system all the way 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.120
 Easy to assemble was that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.870
 whole system is just in quartier 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.789
 to buy 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.859
 this is only possible with two screws here 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.210
 either on the wall or on the wood 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.960
 make clubs as wood was made 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.480
 easy and with a piece of 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.660
 Connection to the cartridge Rhine 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 screw it and then it goes to the extra 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 faucet me on an under table 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.719
 Filter system bought with extra 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 faucet that's very easy there 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 take water and saves me a lot 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 much box-hauling drinking guests 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.430
 drag and save even money 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.960
 as I just figured I jumped 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.610
 cited 200 euros per month 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.840
 Water costs drinking water costs and have 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.570
 in my opinion better the water 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.770
 as what I get in the trade 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 that's why I like the video too 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.750
 just tell the people outside that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.330
 it's real 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.880
 since I connect I have a lot 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.170
 drink more water and very very easy 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 i just believe the bottles 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 fill up the take or I go to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 home and water action and hole 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.170
 my drinking water children drink a lot 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.940
 more and is a great thing and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.560
 that's why this video gives me that 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.100
 thanks can say and the people there 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.490
 can show again that something like that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.490
 It is really easy to build and very much 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.150
 conducive to everyday life and a great one 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.190
 The thing is , the system is very simple 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.290
 the filter as you change it is so 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.940
 a click system and press on it 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.520
 and got the cartridge out please 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.560
 also in there before the water what else 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.700
 out and then turn the cartridge 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.380
 just come in again 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.960
 the new one, the old one and the new one 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.440
 simply go in is quite easy 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.480
 filter is a 2 two systems in it 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 Activated carbon filters The datasheet is available 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.030
 look on the website 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.790
 Activated carbon membrane and my turn 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.680
 and a no lock is up there 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.110
 that means 90 percent of all germs 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.460
 get out and heavy metals hormones pesticides 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.830
 how exactly can you on the website 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.210
 read up 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.150
 The whole thing is also under table 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.580
 Variant in simply twice then becomes 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.500
 one more and threefold circuit each 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.390
 after how much you want to filter and 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:08.580
 There is then over table variant one then 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:13.350
 So I can put you up there 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:17.160
 can show above as I said one 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.650
 Rock crystal circuit triple 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.030
 circuit with a formula got the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.190
 big and two circuit modules agadir 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.800
 has the crystals in the program 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.200
 recorded as you me on the fair 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.390
 have told that is in the vortex 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.560
 Chamber I looked at the new year yet 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:41.390
 a pure vortex chamber done with 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.310
 a malachite whole looks like this 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.800
 decision module I can do here 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.880
 expand and screw it at any time 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.860
 water takes a completely different 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.850
 Properties that is very fresh 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.470
 and so I like it very much 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:01.290
 and refreshes me extremely well as I said 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.820
 there you can see the green stone of the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.030
 Malachite and the inside is just that 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.410
 whirl chamber and down there comes out 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.510
 I can show it here so that's it 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.660
 now 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.799
 the normal course I come here 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:24.860
 a glass and can my drinking water 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:29.010
 here apple the vortex is based on 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.270
 a principle of inclusion, I say that times 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.270
 shortly then you can write it off 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:41.180
 according to the principles of viktor 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.180
 Schauberger I show myself the whirl 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.570
 whole looks like that down then the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:53.690
 pictures of this with that here 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.690
 comes out clean and not so wild 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.879
 here you can 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.050
 Well 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.000
 see the double helix that as it arises 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.310
 is a swirl of this water out 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.390
 comes and what I like to show now 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.070
 It really wants an implosion 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.070
 is a bit follows 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.830
 the whole is based on one 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.289
 merger process comes more 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:36.810
 it is sucked in more air than what 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.789
 comes out when I make it so 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.800
 the water is oxygenated 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.750
 Enriched by the high turbulence 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.060
 very high turbulence by the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.740
 own pressure in the line arises like this 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:53.220
 a high pressure in the vortex chamber and 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.479
 So the property is used to the 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.490
 to generate turbulence 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.110
 through this high turbulence are the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.949
 cluster dissolved in the water and that 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.979
 water becomes so catchy i hope that 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.000
 I'll bring that together now 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.590
 I do not know what his name is but everyone 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.830
 got nobelpreis that he the 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:20.240
 aquapol has recognized him since that's it 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:22.560
 the single entrance the water goes through 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.009
 in the cells in the cell under green 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.599
 just single hair two cows in and out 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.430
 through the turbulence, the 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.080
 water cluster dissolved it and all 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:35.070
 Hartz IV molecules are freely accessible 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.860
 and so can the water in the water 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.620
 replace cell and water and replace 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.139
 detoxify that very important since me 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.900
 just consider that drinking water think 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:53.210
 rather and and merckx on the skin and 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.210
 for much better have your friend yes 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.970
 that's how the whole system looks like 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.940
 great thing 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.470
 As I said, it saves money 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.770
 And the assembly is relatively easy 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.360
 You can also do it by the installer 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.380
 and I am very very very very 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.290
 satisfied with it 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.450
 thank you aqua you for this great 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.370
 technology that you have developed yourself 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.600
 and even in germany produce that 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.070
 I want to say it again 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.230
 really good quality 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:31.710
 they are made of bell city bronze 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:34.020
 Silver plated is also available in gold and it 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.730
 also gives an external application 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.800
 swirling shower but this video revolves 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:41.700
 I will soon 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:45.950
 So as said rock crystal with bronze 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:51.410
 as a watch material for free bronze and 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:51.410
 many thanks
