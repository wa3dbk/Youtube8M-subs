that if I had played mw3 all the time

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.719 
that if I had played mw3 all the time
with<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.170> class<00:02:04.560> setup<00:02:05.040> instead<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.520> playing

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
with this class setup instead of playing

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.130 
with this class setup instead of playing
with<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.969> riot<00:02:06.210> shield<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.750> instead<00:02:07.020> of

gun with a silencer it makes no
different<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.370> think<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.000> believe<00:02:28.720> that

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
different I think that I believe that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.710 
different I think that I believe that
the<00:02:29.200> silencer<00:02:29.830> makes<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.580> even<00:02:30.790> better<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
the silencer makes it even better it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720 
the silencer makes it even better it
makes<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.290> game<00:02:32.500> even<00:02:32.710> more<00:02:32.830> deadly<00:02:33.340> that's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
makes this game even more deadly that's

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.910 
makes this game even more deadly that's
why<00:02:33.880> everyone<00:02:34.300> uses<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> fucking<00:02:35.470> silencer

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920

now nw3 I believe that it had potential
it's<00:03:00.190> pretty<00:03:01.120> much<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.350> mw2<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:04.180> has

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it's pretty much like mw2 but it has

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.150 
it's pretty much like mw2 but it has
different<00:03:05.490> issues<00:03:06.490> for<00:03:06.760> example<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.750> has

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
different issues for example it has

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.640 
different issues for example it has
worse<00:03:09.160> dead<00:03:10.000> streaks<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:11.110> means<00:03:11.350> hand

worse dead streaks that means hand

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.820 
worse dead streaks that means hand

people run super super fast and that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.540 
people run super super fast and that
makes<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.690> game<00:03:22.840> all<00:03:23.050> weird<00:03:23.350> especially<00:03:24.190> if

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
makes the game all weird especially if

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.590 
makes the game all weird especially if
they're<00:03:24.700> using<00:03:24.940> stalker

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
they're using stalker

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.560 
they're using stalker
while<00:03:26.050> juste<00:03:26.440> stalker<00:03:27.430> isn't<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.940> problem<00:03:28.420> I

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
while juste stalker isn't the problem I

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.660 
while juste stalker isn't the problem I
am<00:03:29.020> double<00:03:29.440> through<00:03:29.620> introduced<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.340> perk

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
am double through introduced that perk

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.910 
am double through introduced that perk
to<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> Call<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:31.930> Duty<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.500> think<00:03:32.739> that's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
to a Call of Duty and I think that's

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.740 
to a Call of Duty and I think that's
that's<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.459> part<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.760> breaks<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.540> game<00:03:34.690> a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
that's a part that breaks the game a

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.320 
that's a part that breaks the game a
little<00:03:35.080> bit<00:03:35.230> because<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.770> weird<00:03:36.330> Park

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
little bit because it's a weird Park

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.960 
little bit because it's a weird Park
it's<00:03:38.020> like<00:03:38.320> people<00:03:38.650> come<00:03:39.160> around<00:03:39.280> corners

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
it's like people come around corners

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.580 
it's like people come around corners
super<00:03:40.330> fast<00:03:40.600> it's<00:03:40.780> like<00:03:40.900> they're<00:03:41.230> using

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
that the support package is something

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.280 
that the support package is something
fun<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.220> use<00:04:09.489> it's<00:04:10.090> something<00:04:10.510> fun<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:11.050> use

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.850 
fun to use it's something fun to use
when<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.769> don't<00:04:12.120> want<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.300> play<00:04:13.830> what<00:04:14.830> you

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
when you don't want to play what you

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.500 
when you don't want to play what you
don't<00:04:15.070> want<00:04:15.190> to<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.400> serious<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:16.299> you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
don't want to be serious you just you

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.479 
don't want to be serious you just you

just want to mess around and have fun
and<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.600> think<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.109> support<00:04:20.470> package

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
and I think that the support package

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.960 
and I think that the support package
does<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:22.030> for<00:04:22.330> you<00:04:22.419> very<00:04:22.720> well

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
does that for you very well

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.090 
does that for you very well
obviously<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.720> EMP<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.650> stealth-bomber

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
obviously the EMP and the stealth-bomber

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.490 
obviously the EMP and the stealth-bomber
do<00:04:26.640> not<00:04:26.820> belong<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.480> Support<00:04:27.870> Package<00:04:28.050> and

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
do not belong to the Support Package and

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.080 
do not belong to the Support Package and
they<00:04:28.680> those<00:04:29.190> killstreaks<00:04:29.670> were<00:04:29.730> very

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
they those killstreaks were very

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.150 
they those killstreaks were very
annoying<00:04:30.450> because<00:04:30.660> it<00:04:31.230> was<00:04:31.470> just<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.830> matter<00:04:32.010> of

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
least those two things and also tactical

least those two things and also tactical

which<00:06:00.540> is<00:06:00.720> also<00:06:00.870> very<00:06:01.020> easy<00:06:01.440> to<00:06:02.130> do<00:06:02.250> in<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.580> mw3<00:06:03.240> I

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
which is also very easy to do in a mw3 I

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.760 
which is also very easy to do in a mw3 I
think<00:06:03.810> that<00:06:03.930> this<00:06:04.080> game<00:06:04.229> would<00:06:04.410> have<00:06:04.560> been<00:06:04.740> a

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
think that this game would have been a

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.190 
think that this game would have been a
very<00:06:05.580> very<00:06:05.910> good<00:06:06.180> because<00:06:06.360> it<00:06:06.540> plays<00:06:06.870> good

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
very very good because it plays good

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.790 
very very good because it plays good
it's<00:06:07.530> not<00:06:07.710> weird<00:06:08.070> like<00:06:08.400> black<00:06:08.669> ops<00:06:08.910> 2<00:06:09.270> so

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
it's not weird like black ops 2 so

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.250 
it's not weird like black ops 2 so
that's<00:06:10.800> it<00:06:11.040> guys
