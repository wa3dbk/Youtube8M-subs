00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
artificial blood not quite but Hema pure

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.220 
artificial blood not quite but Hema pure
is<00:00:16.580> an<00:00:16.820> innovative<00:00:17.150> hemoglobin<00:00:18.020> based

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
is an innovative hemoglobin based

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.080 
is an innovative hemoglobin based
product<00:00:18.710> that<00:00:19.250> can<00:00:19.369> reduce<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:19.880> need<00:00:20.029> for

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
product that can reduce the need for

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:29.609 
product that can reduce the need for
blood<00:00:20.450> transfusions<00:00:21.260> for<00:00:21.590> some<00:00:21.890> patients<00:00:22.130> I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.310 

think<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.770> availability<00:00:31.580> of<00:00:31.789> hema<00:00:32.750> pure<00:00:33.020> has

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
think the availability of hema pure has

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.010 
think the availability of hema pure has
changed<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:33.980> way<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.160> used<00:00:34.340> blood<00:00:35.020> because

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
changed the way we used blood because

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.740 
changed the way we used blood because
there's<00:00:36.260> an<00:00:36.379> alternative<00:00:37.070> it's<00:00:37.940> made<00:00:38.239> as<00:00:38.510> more

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
there's an alternative it's made as more

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.870 
there's an alternative it's made as more
conscious<00:00:39.290> of<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.620> side<00:00:39.830> effects<00:00:40.129> of<00:00:40.310> blood

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
conscious of the side effects of blood

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.050 
conscious of the side effects of blood
and<00:00:41.410> it's<00:00:42.410> also<00:00:42.649> decreased<00:00:43.310> our<00:00:43.460> use<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.670> blood

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
and it's also decreased our use of blood

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.020 
and it's also decreased our use of blood
I<00:00:45.130> think<00:00:46.130> it<00:00:46.190> definitely<00:00:46.309> has<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.670> place<00:00:47.000> in

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
I think it definitely has a place in

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.880 
I think it definitely has a place in
orthopedic<00:00:47.660> surgery<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.350> due<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.559> all<00:00:48.739> the

now<00:06:48.830> you<00:06:48.890> lose<00:06:49.220> a<00:06:49.250> twenty-year-old<00:06:50.140> because
