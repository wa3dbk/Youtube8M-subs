00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
it properly so with a bunch of research

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
it properly so with a bunch of research
that's<00:00:24.900> basically<00:00:25.590> what<00:00:26.519> I've<00:00:26.640> come<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:26.910> with

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that's basically what I've come up with

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.330 
that's basically what I've come up with
is<00:00:29.390> basically<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:31.260> an<00:00:31.590> icy

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is basically you have to use an icy

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.790 
is basically you have to use an icy
approved<00:00:35.030> metal<00:00:36.030> box<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.380> plat<00:00:37.590> light

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
approved metal box which your plat light

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.110 
approved metal box which your plat light
is<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> fit<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:40.280> but<00:00:41.280> before<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
is going to fit in but before that you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.040 
is going to fit in but before that you
need<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> install<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.590> vapor<00:00:44.040> barrier

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
need to install the vapor barrier

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.889 
need to install the vapor barrier
plastic<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> resist

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
plastic thing that is going to resist

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.170 
plastic thing that is going to resist

the eat that's going to be generated by
your<00:00:51.390> pot<00:00:51.600> light<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:54.449> thing<00:00:54.750> nobody

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
your pot light so and that thing nobody

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
show you what it looks like because

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
show you what it looks like because
because<00:01:12.960> once<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> hang<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> it's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
because once you get the hang of it it's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
because once you get the hang of it it's
really<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.090> big<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> deal<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
really not that big of a deal to be
