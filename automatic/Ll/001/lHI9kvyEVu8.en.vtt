00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
on it so that's really funny but you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.780 
on it so that's really funny but you
know<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.559> game's<00:00:40.739> almost<00:00:40.980> done<00:00:41.370> anyways

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
know the game's almost done anyways

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.770 
know the game's almost done anyways
because<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.120> call<00:00:42.300> duty<00:00:42.450> advanced<00:00:42.690> warfare

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
because it's call duty advanced warfare

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.180

is<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:44.010> don't

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is about to be out so I really don't

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180 
is about to be out so I really don't
think<00:00:44.219> spawns<00:00:44.610> matter<00:00:45.329> anymore<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:47.010> then

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think spawns matter anymore and then

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
think spawns matter anymore and then
there's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> weapon<00:00:47.820> balance<00:00:48.239> patch<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.899> shot

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
there's a weapon balance patch one shot

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.439 
there's a weapon balance patch one shot
to<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> body<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.670> shot<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.030> head<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to the body and one shot to the head is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.410 
to the body and one shot to the head is
no<00:00:51.660> longer<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.260> kill<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:52.920> ARS<00:00:53.309> SMG<00:00:53.730> slm<00:00:53.789> geez

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
no longer a kill for ARS SMG slm geez

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
no longer a kill for ARS SMG slm geez
increases<00:00:55.320> time<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.340> kill<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.480> scenario

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
increases time to kill in this scenario

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.349 
increases time to kill in this scenario
so<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.640> pretty<00:00:59.820> good<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.090> guess<00:01:00.120> especially

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
so that's pretty good I guess especially

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.849 
so that's pretty good I guess especially
for<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> long<00:01:00.960> season<00:01:01.170> ARS<00:01:01.710> because
