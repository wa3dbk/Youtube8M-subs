00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to be a nice little server and I'll try

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.939 
to be a nice little server and I'll try
to<00:00:24.420> upgrade<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.900> soon<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.230> let's<00:00:25.650> get<00:00:25.769> into

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
to upgrade it soon now let's get into

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.189 
to upgrade it soon now let's get into
this<00:00:26.099> game<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.000> get<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.330> teams<00:00:27.630> each<00:00:27.960> in

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
this game now you get two teams each in

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.669 
this game now you get two teams each in
both<00:00:28.680> pens<00:00:29.240> now<00:00:30.240> this<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:30.840> pen<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.410> these

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
both pens now this is one pen and these

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.290 
both pens now this is one pen and these
are<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> smaller<00:00:32.250> pens<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.940> these<00:00:33.090> are

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
are the smaller pens now these are

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
are the smaller pens now these are
double<00:00:33.600> points<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.110> if<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> get

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
double points so if you get a if you get

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
double points so if you get a if you get
an<00:00:35.430> animal<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.910> there<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.270> double<00:00:36.660> points

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
an animal in there that's double points

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
an animal in there that's double points
and<00:00:37.110> if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> cow<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> not

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and if you get like a cow which is not

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.310 
and if you get like a cow which is not
something<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.149> spawns<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> these

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
something that spawns out of these

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.650 
something that spawns out of these
pointers<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.610> our<00:00:41.760> another<00:00:42.300> double

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
pointers you get our another double

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110 
pointers you get our another double
points<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> would<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.649> 2<00:00:44.309> plus<00:00:44.610> 2<00:00:44.879> that's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
points so that would be 2 plus 2 that's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.360 
points so that would be 2 plus 2 that's
4<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.750> now<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> two-player

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
4 and now this would be a two-player

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
4 and now this would be a two-player
game<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.910> you'd<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.390> person<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.870> here

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
game so you'd have one person in here

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.750 
game so you'd have one person in here
and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.559> other<00:00:49.680> person<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.579> can

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and the other person out here they can

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.790 
and the other person out here they can
either<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.210> fishing<00:00:51.600> rods<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.079> they<00:00:52.739> could

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
either use a fishing rods or they could

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380 
either use a fishing rods or they could
use<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> piece<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> straw<00:00:53.760> when<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> full<00:00:54.239> game

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
