00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.590
 Hi to all of you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.980
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.160
 little trick sees a little glitch on 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.680
 battlefield 3 can hold his grenades 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.010
 medikits or ammunition crates in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 his hands like on pc so let's start 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.420
 by the grenade for the last in 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.279
 your hand and you just have to go out 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 your knife to press the button 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 of the pomegranate and when the pomegranate grows 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 unpin the knife 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.910
 like these and you're going to have your 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.640
 reign in your hands so it's very 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 practice if for example you are like 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.530
 that in a building everyone you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.239
 shoot on it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.649
 gold you shove you throw the grenade 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.579
 and you come back like that we can be 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.500
 more precise it is also our tip and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.229
 that the grenade 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.930
 that's when the grenade come out the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.820
 knife when the grenade come apart 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.479
 hold down the pull button as 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.049
 these are you going to keep the grenade 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.530
 in hand and as soon as you release 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.869
 the pull button she will launch 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
 and there you really have a way very 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.290
 quick to shift throwing your grenade 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.659
 and come back now let's go to the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.520
 ammo box 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:37.079
 so same principle we feel the knife 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.650
 including some ammo and we give back a 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.900
 stabbing 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.579
 so for the crates it's a little bit 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.189
 more complex anyway because he 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.720
 must shock the good timing 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.270
 so that's when you see that your 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.340
 character will let go of the crate gives a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.720
 stabbing is so you do 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.649
 run with to do everything you 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.729
 want and raise it so I'm going to you 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.270
 remount knife on equivalence spell 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.040
 and we have a stab and it's good 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.780
 here 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.050
 so we'll be right back 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 the health care fund we are back 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.460
 let's go to the checkout of his so even 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.220
 principle that ammunition crates 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.290
 we feel the knife and as soon as the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.680
 character will let go of the crate we give 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.680
 a stab 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.260
 and here you have your checkout 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.700
 ammo in your hands so it works 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.640
 with all the equipment that who what 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.680
 by simply pressing the button 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:44.709
 launch the the subject in question and so 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.030
 it's pretty cool peas did it pop 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.630
 it's not bad especially for pomegranates 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:55.300
 in fact we will redo with the grenade 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:58.220
 hop hop hop 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.640
 and here you have a pretty brunette is 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.489
 in your hands 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.840
 if you want to run with your friends 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.450
 it's a little bit more fun than a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.610
 knife but good after was having fun 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.010
 run it's blah 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.940
 and so here I hope that this little 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.830
 video will have pleased you will have helped you and 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.140

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.580
 you do not know him I hold 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.190
 to say that it was not 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.080
 who discovered them but that I 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.299
 make a video because I do not have one 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.680
