00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.860
 and 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.059
 hello dear friends of me 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.240
 say goodbye to a little question how much 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:20.689
 and here people often get sick by mine 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.980
 observations as far as there is a comparison 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.980
 all sorts of colds 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.370
 the question is actually very interesting 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.400
 because honestly I still haven't 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.000
 I can get used to one simple thing 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.780
 people here since childhood 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.200
 roughly speaking from our kindergartens 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.590
 dresses very very very easily 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.780
 regardless of the weather on frost on and not 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 knows 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.030
 snow storms rains there and so on 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.260
 dress up that's how we let dress up 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.809
 well in late autumn 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.350
 1 mu fur coat in this regard when I arrived 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.340
 montreal i flew montreal to canada 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:14.119
 generally 15 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:19.880
 march and numbers somewhere 16 probably march i 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:22.329
 went to the city center and what was for 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.579
 I was a fool when I saw on the street 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:32.770
 teenagers are probably 15 or 16 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:36.350
 which in weather then was in 2011 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.170
 somewhere probably about 15 degrees 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.409
 there is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 Kiran was not spring but it was still around 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.970
 there was still snow till there was light sunshine 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.570
 but she was not particularly generous warmed 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 but it struck me that the teenagers were standing 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.860
 in the street they were quietly talking and they 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 were wearing a t-shirt imagine over 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.700
 degrees and business man t-shirt and stand on 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.759
 the street talk further worse the further i 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.580
 seen and see now let's say today 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:17.580
 I had twenty degrees in the city 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:19.860
 -20 degrees and when I returned from 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.120
 leaving the building of the sports center 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.790
 I saw you local to a young guy 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.530
 about twenty years old who must have been dressed 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.330
 know how he was dressed in light so 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.680
 something in the spirit of balloon you jackets 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.050
 and on his feet he had 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.480
 attention -20 the snow lies on the street but you 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.670
 see for yourself how u to still type 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.630
 some nafig get even Nekrasov 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.700
 food was year sneakers rubber sneakers and here 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.390
 this fashion is by the way the youth is local 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.800
 walking in rubber boots 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.920
 in any weather or rubber sneakers in 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.980
 any weather in the snow in the frost 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.459
 she shocked me 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.760
 and I want to say about the disease and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.430
 how common are they here 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.239
 the disease here is very expensive i'm here recently 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.239
 I got a cold and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.210
 i need entail between needed 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.410
 buy medicine to 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.000
 temperature drive away and 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.120
 Mushrooms you any signs to remove 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.640
 and I went to the pharmacy that's what I would 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.380
 spent in Russia on everything about everything 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.620
 Well, I think that there are about 500 rubles here. 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.260
 spent on the same order somewhere 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.160
 if you translate into rubles about two 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.070
 thousand rubles 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.770
 somewhere around 70 80 dollars I'm on it 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.390
 spent 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:04.150
 I highly recommend to be ill 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.280
 take care of yourself and so on but so here 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.120
 about the prevalence of the disease 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.750
 still finish this topic so I will say 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.940
 more here extremely rarely the language is likely 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.040
 probably because they are all from 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.890
 yourself hardened very childhood 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.250
 because kindergarten starts they 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.100
 sit on the ground they want leaves in sneakers 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.960
 in the summer some light jackets winter 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.280
 in the cold 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.220
 the worst thing I see here is 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.910
 youth is something that does not sneeze wallet 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.270
 blow your nose 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.380
 all so that they cut down and they are there 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.560
 their lives fell out there some 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.990
 mega temperature attacks were 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.460
 they do not know there an ambulance causes 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.630
 pleasure is such that you feel bad 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.700
 was was 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.820
 such a shouter your life here every 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.790
 I have never seen a day in general how to do 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.930
 several hundred stormy 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.280
 answered the question 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.630
 hopefully 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.180
 how will any more questions on this 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.620
