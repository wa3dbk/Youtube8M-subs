00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and look and just like gold fire since

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.510 
and look and just like gold fire since
the<00:02:12.319> only<00:02:12.530> real<00:02:12.680> physical<00:02:13.160> difference

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
the only real physical difference

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.930 
the only real physical difference
between<00:02:14.950> him<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:15.980> Megatron<00:02:16.400> aside<00:02:16.819> from

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
between him and Megatron aside from

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.630 
between him and Megatron aside from
colors<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.840> head<00:02:18.110> mold<00:02:18.349> he<00:02:19.130> transforms

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
colors is the head mold he transforms

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.970 
colors is the head mold he transforms
exactly<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.090> same<00:02:20.300> way<00:02:20.480> as<00:02:20.780> Megatron<00:02:21.500> did

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
exactly the same way as Megatron did

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.740 
exactly the same way as Megatron did
so<00:02:22.790> he's<00:02:22.910> pop<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.240> wings<00:02:23.420> off<00:02:23.600> here

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
so he's pop the wings off here

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.990 
so he's pop the wings off here
go<00:02:25.740> ahead<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:25.980> snap<00:02:26.190> those<00:02:26.370> together<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.790> form

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
go ahead and snap those together to form

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.100 
go ahead and snap those together to form
his<00:02:27.090> cannon<00:02:29.480> tab<00:02:30.480> those<00:02:30.660> together<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.080> that

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
his cannon tab those together like that

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.010 
his cannon tab those together like that
clip<00:02:32.010> little<00:02:32.250> peg<00:02:32.430> out<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> can

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
clip little peg out and then you can

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.820 
clip little peg out and then you can
pull<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.890> extend<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.260> again<00:02:37.560> much

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
pull on this to extend and again much

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.140 
pull on this to extend and again much
like<00:02:37.980> Moby<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.520> little<00:02:38.700> tighter<00:02:38.880> on

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
like Moby it's a little tighter on

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.640 
like Moby it's a little tighter on
dreadwing<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.960> weird<00:02:40.200> I've<00:02:40.290> never<00:02:40.320> had

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
dreadwing it's weird I've never had

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.100 
dreadwing it's weird I've never had
molds<00:02:40.950> getting<00:02:41.330> more<00:02:42.330> sturdy<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.810> stable

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
molds getting more sturdy and stable

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.940 
molds getting more sturdy and stable
with<00:02:43.880> molten<00:02:44.880> reuses<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.900> usually<00:02:46.680> get<00:02:46.860> a

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
with molten reuses I usually get a

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.890 
with molten reuses I usually get a
balloon<00:02:47.070> sore<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.550> yeah<00:02:48.450> flip<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.780> up

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
balloon sore so yeah flip that up

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.930 
balloon sore so yeah flip that up
perform<00:02:49.200> little<00:02:49.410> cannon<00:02:49.770> whoa<00:02:50.550> let's<00:02:50.700> step<00:02:50.850> it

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
perform little cannon whoa let's step it

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.490 
perform little cannon whoa let's step it
off<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.240> side<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.420> right<00:02:51.630> now<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.350> here's

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
off to the side for right now and here's

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.880 
off to the side for right now and here's
the<00:02:52.590> main<00:02:52.710> body<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.070> robot<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.800> go

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the main body of the robot so just go

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.850 
the main body of the robot so just go
ahead<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.250> pop<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:56.640> out<00:02:57.560> pop<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.710> legs

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
ahead and pop these out pop the legs

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.190 
ahead and pop these out pop the legs
down<00:03:00.470> stand<00:03:01.470> them<00:03:01.620> down<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:03.450> used<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.930> use

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
down stand them down I just used I use

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.750 
down stand them down I just used I use
the<00:03:04.350> motion<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.770> transforming<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> legs<00:03:05.610> down

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the motion of transforming the legs down

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.280 
the motion of transforming the legs down
to<00:03:05.970> flip<00:03:06.150> those<00:03:06.270> kneecaps<00:03:06.660> out<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.960> can<00:03:07.080> flip

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
to flip those kneecaps out you can flip

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.050 
to flip those kneecaps out you can flip
them<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.440> individually<00:03:08.010> before<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.880> pull

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
them out individually before you pull

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.850 
them out individually before you pull
the<00:03:09.090> legs<00:03:09.330> down<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.660> want<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.050> saves<00:03:10.770> a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
the legs down if you want but saves a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.700 
the legs down if you want but saves a
little<00:03:11.040> time<00:03:11.190> if<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.460> just<00:03:12.170> kinda<00:03:13.170> just<00:03:13.290> pull

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
little time if you just kinda just pull

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.200 
little time if you just kinda just pull

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
the knee down let those pop up on their

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.540 
the knee down let those pop up on their
own

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:32.449

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
in there make sure that tabs into there

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.210 
in there make sure that tabs into there
get<00:03:36.270> them<00:03:36.390> all<00:03:36.480> nice<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.870> sturdy<00:03:37.220> apparently

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
get them all nice and sturdy apparently

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.979 
get them all nice and sturdy apparently
you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.580> if<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.120> want<00:03:39.239> as<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> transformation

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
you can if you want as a transformation

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.270 
you can if you want as a transformation
step<00:03:41.209> lift<00:03:42.209> these<00:03:42.480> up<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.320> find<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.770> that

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
step lift these up but I find that that

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.860 
step lift these up but I find that that
seems<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.610> be<00:03:44.640> all<00:03:44.760> where<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:44.940> flip<00:03:45.600> these<00:03:45.720> up

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
seems to be all where you flip these up

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.300 
seems to be all where you flip these up
there's<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.470> pin<00:03:46.680> there<00:03:46.830> but<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.040> seems<00:03:47.160> where

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
there's a pin there but that seems where

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.530 
there's a pin there but that seems where
we<00:03:47.370> where<00:03:47.520> a<00:03:47.550> lot<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.790> people<00:03:48.030> are<00:03:48.120> getting<00:03:48.300> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
we where a lot of people are getting the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.180 
we where a lot of people are getting the
stress<00:03:48.810> marks<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.320> from<00:03:49.470> this<00:03:49.620> pin<00:03:49.830> right<00:03:49.860> here

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
stress marks is from this pin right here

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.270 
stress marks is from this pin right here
and<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.330> easily<00:03:51.920> transform<00:03:52.920> him<00:03:53.040> without

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
and you can easily transform him without

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.190 
and you can easily transform him without
even<00:03:53.580> messing<00:03:53.760> with<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.959> my

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
even messing with that so my

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.580 
even messing with that so my
recommendation<00:03:55.800> is<00:03:55.920> why<00:03:56.519> risk<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.590> there

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
recommendation is why risk it and there

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.790 
recommendation is why risk it and there
is<00:03:58.950> adrenaline<00:03:59.910> in<00:04:00.690> robot<00:04:01.019> mode<00:04:01.050> he<00:04:01.530> does<00:04:01.680> not

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
is adrenaline in robot mode he does not

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.590 
is adrenaline in robot mode he does not
have<00:04:02.010> his<00:04:02.070> Decepticon<00:04:02.880> symbol<00:04:03.209> here<00:04:03.360> on<00:04:03.510> his

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
have his Decepticon symbol here on his

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.300 
have his Decepticon symbol here on his
chest<00:04:03.840> like<00:04:03.989> Megatron<00:04:04.260> does<00:04:04.560> but<00:04:05.070> he<00:04:05.130> does

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
chest like Megatron does but he does

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.820 
chest like Megatron does but he does
still<00:04:05.489> retain<00:04:05.610> those<00:04:05.940> two<00:04:06.180> g2<00:04:06.390> symbols<00:04:06.930> there

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
still retain those two g2 symbols there

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.180 
still retain those two g2 symbols there
on<00:04:08.010> either<00:04:08.250> side<00:04:08.550> of<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.269> cockpit<00:04:10.010> what<00:04:11.010> was

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
on either side of a the cockpit what was

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.380 
on either side of a the cockpit what was
the<00:04:11.310> copy<00:04:11.519> I<00:04:11.640> guess<00:04:11.790> an<00:04:11.880> actual<00:04:12.090> cockroach

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
the copy I guess an actual cockroach

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.100 
the copy I guess an actual cockroach
down<00:04:12.570> here<00:04:12.750> now

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
in the comics when he was in this form

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.699 
in the comics when he was in this form
yeah<00:04:51.239> part<00:04:51.509> of<00:04:51.539> me<00:04:51.629> is<00:04:51.689> because<00:04:51.869> I<00:04:52.019> loved<00:04:52.529> the

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:54.119 
issue that he appeared in when he first

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:56.209 
issue that he appeared in when he first
showed<00:04:54.209> up<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:55.169> Megatron<00:04:55.469> spotlight<00:04:56.099> with

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
showed up that Megatron spotlight with

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.739 
showed up that Megatron spotlight with
Nic<00:04:56.399> Roche<00:04:56.819> just<00:04:57.179> I<00:04:57.330> thought<00:04:57.629> the

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
Nic Roche just I thought the

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.029 
Nic Roche just I thought the
characterization<00:04:58.409> was<00:04:58.559> really<00:04:58.739> good<00:04:58.889> in<00:04:59.009> that

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
characterization was really good in that

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.609 
characterization was really good in that
I<00:04:59.369> really<00:04:59.969> liked<00:05:00.509> this<00:05:00.659> design<00:05:00.839> on<00:05:01.139> Megatron

00:05:01.609 --> 00:05:01.619 
I really liked this design on Megatron

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:06.290 
I really liked this design on Megatron
and<00:05:03.619> you<00:05:04.619> know<00:05:04.709> it<00:05:04.829> wasn't<00:05:05.399> a<00:05:05.550> form<00:05:06.179> we'd

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
and you know it wasn't a form we'd

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.069 
and you know it wasn't a form we'd
really<00:05:06.539> seen<00:05:06.779> Megatron<00:05:07.229> in<00:05:07.379> before<00:05:07.709> and<00:05:08.039> I

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:09.079 
really seen Megatron in before and I

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.909 
really seen Megatron in before and I
thought<00:05:10.079> it<00:05:10.139> really<00:05:10.439> worked<00:05:10.649> I<00:05:10.769> thought

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
thought it really worked I thought

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.639 
thought it really worked I thought
really<00:05:11.129> conveyed<00:05:11.429> power<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.269> I<00:05:12.719> was<00:05:12.959> big<00:05:13.379> and

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:13.649 
really conveyed power and I was big and

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:16.100 
really conveyed power and I was big and
huge<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.159> awesome<00:05:14.309> looking<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:14.939> then<00:05:15.629> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
huge and awesome looking and then and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.499 
huge and awesome looking and then and
then<00:05:16.559> he<00:05:16.649> went<00:05:16.769> back<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.009> his<00:05:17.309> I<00:05:17.579> guess<00:05:17.939> war

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
then he went back to his I guess war

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.899 
then he went back to his I guess war
within<00:05:18.719> looking<00:05:19.289> tank<00:05:19.649> mode<00:05:19.919> we<00:05:20.669> have<00:05:20.699> only

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
within looking tank mode we have only

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.419 
within looking tank mode we have only
seen<00:05:21.089> much<00:05:21.239> of<00:05:21.269> him<00:05:21.449> since<00:05:21.629> he<00:05:21.719> reverted<00:05:21.989> back

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:22.429 
seen much of him since he reverted back

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:26.089 
seen much of him since he reverted back
in<00:05:23.429> robots<00:05:23.759> in<00:05:23.879> disguise<00:05:23.909> but<00:05:24.899> again<00:05:25.499> it<00:05:25.679> fits

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
in robots in disguise but again it fits

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.129 
in robots in disguise but again it fits
really<00:05:26.279> well<00:05:26.429> with<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:27.209> g2<00:05:27.509> dreadwing<00:05:27.749> over
