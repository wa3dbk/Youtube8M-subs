00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
no image or non image so um an image the

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.590 
no image or non image so um an image the
difference<00:05:32.250> is<00:05:32.430> an<00:05:32.640> image<00:05:32.880> takes<00:05:33.150> fast<00:05:33.390> or

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
difference is an image takes fast or

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.040 
difference is an image takes fast or
longer<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.350> load<00:05:34.530> but<00:05:35.100> it<00:05:35.280> looks<00:05:35.490> better<00:05:35.700> and<00:05:35.820> a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
longer to load but it looks better and a

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.450 
longer to load but it looks better and a
non-image<00:05:37.050> for<00:05:37.530> example<00:05:37.890> if<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.280> want

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
non-image for example if you want

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.020 
non-image for example if you want
something<00:05:38.729> to<00:05:39.240> be<00:05:39.270> text<00:05:40.020> then<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.800> would<00:05:41.220> use

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
something to be text then you would use

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.090 
something to be text then you would use
a<00:05:42.060> non-image<00:05:42.660> because<00:05:43.020> then<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.440> are<00:05:43.470> you<00:05:43.830> put

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
a non-image because then you are you put

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.010 
a non-image because then you are you put
text<00:05:44.430> in<00:05:44.490> there<00:05:44.669> so<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.330> can<00:05:45.479> change<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.810> name

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
text in there so you can change the name

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.090 
text in there so you can change the name
of<00:05:46.050> it<00:05:46.260> i'm<00:05:46.410> showing<00:05:46.710> leave<00:05:46.860> it<00:05:46.979> as<00:05:47.070> the

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
of it i'm showing leave it as the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.400 
of it i'm showing leave it as the
default<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.790> URL<00:05:48.780> this<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.110> pretty

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
default and the URL this is pretty

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.870 
default and the URL this is pretty
important<00:05:49.800> because<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.490> could<00:05:50.640> actually
