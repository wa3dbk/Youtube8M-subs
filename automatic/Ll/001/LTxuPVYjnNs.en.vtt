00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:10.590
 just before bringing is mainly 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:16.679
 by yoga exercises or just before 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.529
 just art a dive so just before 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:22.439
 we will say if one morning I have a dive 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.819
 very deep scheduled at 11am the morning 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.589
 when I wake up it's true that I'm doing 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.689
 some small stretching exercises 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.300
 who binds them to the guys to wake up the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.539
 body is then there is actually a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.910
 work of 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.290
 a work of relaxation and 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:42.190
 breathing diaphragm preparation 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.110
 we will try to work on making 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.620
 the most flexible lungs effective 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.920
 possible 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.829
 because it takes both the breeze 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.809
 possible air that inspires is at the 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.269
 time when one has in great depth to 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.879
 more than 100 m happened to that the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.420
 lungs crushes the most comfortably 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.010
 possible 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.140
 so we have to work this amplitude 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 so that's very low 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.020
 the daily depends on the training 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.150
 varies according to the year for example 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.880
 on means an objective that takes place at 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.250
 September month where the future this 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.210
 year I'm going to try time to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.610
 game and try to break a record of 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.590
 world in the month of june 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.790
 andres so here I take in December 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.020
 offer because I'm just coming out of a 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 competition but as of January I'm going 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.740
 attack so it's been six months 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.290
 ben salah stand out from several 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.479
 ways early in the season he has 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.259
 so a lot of physical preparation 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.990
 that is, I'm not necessarily going 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.970
 do a lot of calls at sea I can 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.039
 finally that once in the week I 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.440
 am going to do it once or twice and had a 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.630
 sitting where two of two pools 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.679
 by cons a lot of preparation 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.429
 physics findus who ride a bike 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.530
 swimming a little bodybuilding too he 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.690
 must prepare the body for the future 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.090
 then in the middle of the season so the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.390
 two months after the two three 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.320
 month 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.079
 no no i have february by march april 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.549
 march april may it's going to be a straw of 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.220
 transition I will continue to make 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.140
 physical preparation but everything 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.000
 gently it'll go down and I'm going 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.829
 do more and more to call more 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.239
 to call in the pool I will 20h of 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.650
 acne in the gym also 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.200
 to prepare the muscles so called 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.739
 and I'm going to their mother more and more 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.360
 often 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.250
 it's good because it's spring 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.620
 water is warming up we try to 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.780
 follow the season and 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.879
 the last month is going to be devoted 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.010
 only to the dive so here I do 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.340
 almost nothing next to it 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.930
 more of more physical preparation 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.310
 almost no pool, however 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.780
 a lot more exercise stretching 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.629
 of breathing and there I am going to dive 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.459
 dive dive 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.459
 we do not dive all year 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 intensively
