00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.689 

all<00:00:21.380> right<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:21.650> start<00:00:21.890> this<00:00:22.010> project<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:22.550> use<00:00:22.670> a

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
all right to start this project I use a

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.099 
all right to start this project I use a
piece<00:00:22.939> of<00:00:22.970> cardboard<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:23.689> I<00:00:23.779> cut<00:00:23.960> about<00:00:24.050> two

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
piece of cardboard and I cut about two

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.659 
piece of cardboard and I cut about two
and<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.349> half<00:00:24.470> inches<00:00:24.740> wide<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.250> you<00:00:25.310> can<00:00:25.460> see<00:00:25.640> I

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
and a half inches wide and you can see I

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.670 
and a half inches wide and you can see I
scored<00:00:26.270> between<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.840> corrugations<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:27.590> only

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
scored between the corrugations I only

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.220 
scored between the corrugations I only
scored<00:00:28.009> one<00:00:28.220> side<00:00:28.489> and<00:00:28.820> then<00:00:29.599> for<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:29.869> top<00:00:30.050> I

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
scored one side and then for the top I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.900 
scored one side and then for the top I
cut<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.439> two<00:00:30.650> inch<00:00:30.829> circle<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.460> score<00:00:31.759> that

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
cut a two inch circle and score that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.389 
cut a two inch circle and score that
also<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:32.449> it<00:00:32.599> looked<00:00:32.780> like<00:00:32.900> boards<00:00:33.290> now<00:00:34.250> in

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
also so it looked like boards now in

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.579 
also so it looked like boards now in
this<00:00:34.520> next<00:00:34.730> photo<00:00:34.970> much<00:00:35.270> like<00:00:35.480> my<00:00:35.720> barrel

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:36.589 
this next photo much like my barrel

into the styrofoam balls and just wanted
to<00:01:18.350> make<00:01:18.500> an<00:01:18.619> interesting<00:01:19.720> contraption<00:01:20.720> look

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
to make an interesting contraption look

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.679
