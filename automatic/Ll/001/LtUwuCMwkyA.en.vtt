00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.850 
on it which is the drop down to a low D
which<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.330> super<00:03:44.630> essential<00:03:45.080> especially<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
which is super essential especially the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.620 
which is super essential especially the
fact<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.070> it's<00:03:46.250> not<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.370> 5/16<00:03:47.240> bass<00:03:47.420> ketball

fact that it's not a 5/16 bass ketball
oh<00:03:47.870> no<00:03:48.020> it's<00:03:48.140> easier<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:50.150> did<00:03:50.510> one<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
oh no it's easier and I did one of the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.900 
oh no it's easier and I did one of the
fancy<00:03:51.350> thing<00:03:51.530> on<00:03:51.650> this<00:03:51.800> bass<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.610> had<00:03:52.820> it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
fancy thing on this bass that I had it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.060 
fancy thing on this bass that I had it
on<00:03:53.030> my<00:03:53.150> own<00:03:53.180> which<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.660> D<00:03:55.720> which<00:03:56.720> are<00:03:56.960> Sims<00:03:57.800> in

you'll know you're in that area we start

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.110

to<00:05:21.800> feel<00:05:21.950> a<00:05:22.010> whole<00:05:22.280> underneath<00:05:22.790> you

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
to feel a whole underneath you

a<00:05:23.150> lot<00:05:23.419> of<00:05:23.479> times<00:05:23.630> I'm<00:05:23.720> not<00:05:23.780> looking<00:05:24.169> so<00:05:24.530> but

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
a lot of times I'm not looking so but

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.060 
a lot of times I'm not looking so but
it's<00:05:26.449> again<00:05:26.960> not<00:05:26.990> an<00:05:27.199> essential<00:05:27.470> thing<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:27.979> I

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
it's again not an essential thing and I

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.680 
it's again not an essential thing and I
didn't<00:05:28.310> want<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.550> lose<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.150> much<00:05:29.270> wood<00:05:29.510> by

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
didn't want to lose so much wood by

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.870 
didn't want to lose so much wood by
scalloping<00:05:30.380> out<00:05:30.530> of<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.710> whole<00:05:30.860> neck<00:05:31.160> I<00:05:31.490> thought

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
scalloping out of a whole neck I thought

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.040 
scalloping out of a whole neck I thought
it'd<00:05:31.970> be<00:05:32.000> kind<00:05:32.180> of<00:05:32.210> cool<00:05:32.419> thing<00:05:32.570> to<00:05:32.630> plant<00:05:32.840> a

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
it'd be kind of cool thing to plant a

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.780 
it'd be kind of cool thing to plant a
little<00:05:33.229> bit<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.530> scalloped<00:05:33.919> feel<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:34.699> we

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
little bit of a scalloped feel so we

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.430 
little bit of a scalloped feel so we
just<00:05:34.970> did<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.180> sort<00:05:35.780> of<00:05:35.840> originally<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.380> just

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
just did the sort of originally I just

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.100 
just did the sort of originally I just
did<00:05:36.710> half<00:05:36.889> way<00:05:37.100> across<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.820> that's<00:05:38.720> just<00:05:38.990> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
did half way across and that's just the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.070 
did half way across and that's just the
last<00:05:39.350> five<00:05:39.620> breaths<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.160> then<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:41.750> that's

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
last five breaths and then that that's

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.020 
last five breaths and then that that's
why<00:05:42.290> we<00:05:42.650> adapted<00:05:43.100> this<00:05:43.190> bullet-shaped<00:05:43.550> fret

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
why we adapted this bullet-shaped fret

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.939 
why we adapted this bullet-shaped fret
marker<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.600> coincide<00:05:45.020> with<00:05:45.260> you<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:47.949> scallop

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 
marker to coincide with you the scallop

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:56.469 
marker to coincide with you the scallop
all<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.669> way<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:49.760> mean<00:05:54.910> this<00:05:55.910> is<00:05:56.090> number<00:05:56.210> two

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
all the way I mean this is number two

all the way I mean this is number two
the<00:05:57.410> main<00:05:57.560> base<00:05:57.740> is<00:05:57.770> getting<00:05:58.070> strings<00:05:58.639> put

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
the main base is getting strings put

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.060 
the main base is getting strings put
onyx<00:05:59.090> we<00:05:59.210> had<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.330> sweaty<00:05:59.660> showing<00:06:00.169> the<00:06:00.770> strings

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
onyx we had a sweaty showing the strings

onyx we had a sweaty showing the strings
on<00:06:01.250> that<00:06:01.490> it<00:06:01.610> sounds<00:06:01.850> like<00:06:01.940> this<00:06:02.120> now<00:06:02.500> because

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
on that it sounds like this now because

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.590 
on that it sounds like this now because
they're<00:06:03.650> so<00:06:03.830> is<00:06:04.460> it<00:06:04.669> also<00:06:04.820> a<00:06:04.970> four<00:06:05.180> string

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
they're so is it also a four string

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.700 
they're so is it also a four string
yeah<00:06:06.050> so<00:06:06.770> with<00:06:07.900> so<00:06:08.900> many<00:06:09.020> people<00:06:09.410> have<00:06:09.500> moved

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
yeah so with so many people have moved

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.830 
yeah so with so many people have moved
up<00:06:09.889> to<00:06:10.010> five<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.550> six<00:06:10.789> and<00:06:11.180> you've<00:06:11.449> stuck

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
up to five and six and you've stuck

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.540 
up to five and six and you've stuck
mostly<00:06:12.110> with<00:06:12.530> four<00:06:12.740> strings<00:06:13.039> and<00:06:13.220> is<00:06:13.400> there<00:06:13.520> a

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
mostly with four strings and is there a

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.860 
mostly with four strings and is there a
reason<00:06:13.820> for<00:06:13.850> that<00:06:14.000> I<00:06:14.150> can<00:06:14.360> get<00:06:14.479> a<00:06:14.510> be<00:06:14.660> out<00:06:14.840> of

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
reason for that I can get a be out of

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:23.580 
reason for that I can get a be out of
this<00:06:15.020> easy<00:06:15.370> me<00:06:18.310> there's<00:06:19.310> a<00:06:19.400> T<00:06:19.639> and<00:06:19.850> there's<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.150> I

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.740 

so<00:06:24.590> I<00:06:24.650> can<00:06:24.770> bend<00:06:24.889> down<00:06:25.070> to<00:06:25.160> a<00:06:25.250> B<00:06:25.400> no<00:06:25.550> problem<00:06:26.000> and

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
so I can bend down to a B no problem and

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.110 
so I can bend down to a B no problem and
also<00:06:26.900> a<00:06:27.020> lot<00:06:27.320> the<00:06:27.500> device<00:06:27.770> a<00:06:27.800> bit<00:06:28.460> more<00:06:28.610> solid<00:06:28.820> B

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
also a lot the device a bit more solid B

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.930 
also a lot the device a bit more solid B
I<00:06:29.150> can<00:06:29.300> get<00:06:29.570> it<00:06:29.720> so<00:06:29.900> I<00:06:29.960> get<00:06:30.110> the<00:06:30.229> low<00:06:30.349> note<00:06:30.560> of<00:06:30.680> a

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
I can get it so I get the low note of a

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.870 
I can get it so I get the low note of a
of<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:32.150> five<00:06:32.780> or<00:06:32.810> six<00:06:33.080> string<00:06:33.260> bass<00:06:33.669> and<00:06:34.669> I'm

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
simplified but it's just a little bit

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.150 
simplified but it's just a little bit
confusing<00:07:08.330> for<00:07:08.449> me<00:07:08.690> and<00:07:08.960> um<00:07:09.199> it<00:07:09.710> would<00:07:09.860> require

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
confusing for me and um it would require

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.310 
confusing for me and um it would require
me<00:07:10.370> a<00:07:10.400> little<00:07:10.610> bit<00:07:10.760> to<00:07:11.449> apply<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.080> little<00:07:12.199> more

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
me a little bit to apply a little more

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.680 
me a little bit to apply a little more
thought<00:07:12.650> to<00:07:12.919> it<00:07:13.400> and<00:07:13.729> then<00:07:14.150> when<00:07:14.270> I'm<00:07:14.389> playing
