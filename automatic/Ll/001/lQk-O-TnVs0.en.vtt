00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hi people want one of the 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.700
 movies today a cursor is talking 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.859
 video for you because you found 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.420
 my my first time movie 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.160
 all were quite fun these days 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.019
 no longer makes looking for kind of videos 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 so now i want some sort of with already 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.580
 making movies of people I meet 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.590
 worse and this becomes part 1 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 and that is about guys I like 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.100
 First of all I can really get worse 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.279
 with boys it is that they go farming 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.590
 while they talk and just guys 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.140
 must always leave a farmer every hour or 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.550
 so and then it's just one they are on 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.899
 talk to you and that's how nice we became 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.020
 just continue some who likes it 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.059
 well in you know but you still have 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.290
 always because you are the farmer and his 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.940
 talk to him 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.770
 That's not what it is with guys in it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 just have a lot of exhaust fumes or something 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.300
 not i think it's a bit of him living 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 that those are gone then there may be that I 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.449
 of love 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.399
 I sit right in front of you are now 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.079
 farmers in my face thank you another thing 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.489
 where i really go i am a bad thing 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.390
 Guys went hint of it too 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.430
 very often 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.660
 For example if a girl is a hunt one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.119
 young place of what do you want for you 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.920
 birthday and girl i need nothing then 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.670
 it means that they do that and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.680
 girls 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.119
 yes we do it all still said nothing 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.890
 want but secretly we want anyway 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.450
 and we just don't want to happen 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.869
 and then you get and think about it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.759
 at country you don't understand if you think so 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.479
 a lot of girls want you earlier 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.650
 I am so timed that you know that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.960
 person thinks 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.880
 and then you think you understand me now 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.470
 where am i talking start the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.210
 I also find it annoying if you 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.369
 I am sacky so the boy doesn't think so 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 for example, your period is that one 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.630
 boy you really chunks the whole lesson 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.420
 and then you say stop it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 and therefore immediately sorry from gay people 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.000
 your period or something then I can really 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.890
 not to van we do not have to be very quiet 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 to be boys are so often grumpy 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.280
 and those as far as I know are not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.549
 period 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.649
 so yes that says something of or just 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.899
 something that every girl thinks of 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.399
 annoying is that boys are going very tough 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.940
 we do friends and with you really 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.470
 be totally different so be with you 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.720
 super sweet and i like their friends and 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.460
 do you think o no now I have to act tough 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.730
 then she thinks i am a you 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.250
 are 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.360
 and then they go very strange at once 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.680
 against you 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.050
 and I did this to a lot of guys 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.940
 so if you are a boy do this 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.350
 look stop that because your girlfriend from 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.120
 that really not nice 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.710
 and just stay sweet to it even though it should 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.330
 your friends door because it's you 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.400
 friends who accept you as you do 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.470
 are also a boys really very much 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.510
 respond to what they for example 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.780
 if you really air your whole heart with young 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.750
 and then you get a reply 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.930
 word back and then essen okay 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:51.380
 or it was just me you really my 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.940
 feelings and then so also they Gym 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.880

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.860
 for their thinking and god went olympic 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.290

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.860
 still have a lesson but they really just go 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.420
 for the for just really good and afterwards 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.460
 were really in that way in class 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.530

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.420
 few because sometimes did not even get one 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.310
 figure and still this really like the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.300
