of the history of science fiction series
today<00:00:06.120> we're<00:00:06.240> gonna<00:00:06.330> be<00:00:06.450> looking<00:00:06.540> at<00:00:06.779> the

today we're gonna be looking at the

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.810 
today we're gonna be looking at the
period<00:00:07.109> from<00:00:07.229> the<00:00:07.290> 1980s<00:00:08.130> up<00:00:08.370> until<00:00:08.760> the

little bit in the last video we looked
at<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> period<00:00:12.720> from<00:00:12.900> 1940<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.920> 1970s<00:00:14.760> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220

its largely positive outlook so we went
from<00:00:19.740> science<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.340> technology<00:00:20.910> always<00:00:21.090> being

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
from science and technology always being
wonderful<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.140> amazing<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.770> looking<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.190> how

sub-genre<00:03:15.890> but<00:03:16.820> there<00:03:17.060> have<00:03:17.299> been<00:03:17.329> the

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
sub-genre but there have been the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.509 
sub-genre but there have been the
emergence<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.320> loads<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.709> new<00:03:18.859> themes<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
emergence of loads of new themes and

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.020 
emergence of loads of new themes and
ideas<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:20.239> let's<00:03:20.720> examine<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.200> few<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.470> those<00:03:22.030> as

ideas so let's examine a few of those as

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.220 
ideas so let's examine a few of those as
new<00:03:23.269> scientific<00:03:23.630> discoveries<00:03:24.109> and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
new scientific discoveries and

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.750

thing like Neal Stephenson's Dimond age
where<00:04:02.269> it's<00:04:02.359> mostly<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.690> background<00:04:03.230> thing<00:04:03.500> but

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
where it's mostly a background thing but

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.349 
where it's mostly a background thing but
it's<00:04:03.980> used<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.250> construct<00:04:04.609> everything<00:04:04.850> and<00:04:05.269> to

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
it's used to construct everything and to

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.170 
it's used to construct everything and to
feed<00:04:05.630> everyone<00:04:06.489> another<00:04:07.489> concept<00:04:07.819> is<00:04:07.940> people

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
future world where all of the normal

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.140 
future world where all of the normal
food<00:04:30.320> crops<00:04:30.620> have<00:04:30.860> been<00:04:30.890> wiped<00:04:31.310> out<00:04:31.550> by<00:04:31.730> GM

there<00:05:23.060> was<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.510> real<00:05:23.750> face<00:05:24.020> where<00:05:24.230> science

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470

change and they have been changing
slowly<00:05:32.000> but<00:05:32.419> surely

about<00:06:24.500> life<00:06:24.770> while<00:06:25.070> we<00:06:25.160> sleep<00:06:25.400> so<00:06:25.910> we're

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
about life while we sleep so we're

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.340 
about life while we sleep so we're
trying<00:06:26.270> out<00:06:26.540> different<00:06:26.570> reactions<00:06:27.290> to

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
trying out different reactions to

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.320 
trying out different reactions to
potential<00:06:27.950> scenarios<00:06:28.430> however<00:06:28.880> improbable

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330

those<00:06:29.750> scenarios<00:06:30.229> may<00:06:30.440> seem<00:06:30.710> so<00:06:31.220> that<00:06:31.400> we're

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
those scenarios may seem so that we're

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.950 
those scenarios may seem so that we're
better<00:06:31.669> prepared<00:06:32.210> if<00:06:32.360> something<00:06:32.390> like<00:06:32.750> that

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.350 
better prepared if something like that
happens<00:06:33.380> in<00:06:33.500> real<00:06:33.530> life<00:06:33.919> and<00:06:34.250> I<00:06:34.880> like<00:06:35.150> to<00:06:35.300> think

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
happens in real life and I like to think

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.790 
happens in real life and I like to think
of

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800
