beautiful<00:01:39.680> microphone<00:01:40.430> I've<00:01:40.700> had<00:01:40.909> that<00:01:41.090> for

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
beautiful microphone I've had that for

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.929 
beautiful microphone I've had that for
45<00:01:43.430> years

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
45 years

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.050 
45 years
the<00:01:44.210> older<00:01:44.450> AKG<00:01:44.899> microphones<00:01:45.770> were<00:01:46.430> not<00:01:46.640> built

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
the older AKG microphones were not built

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.200 
the older AKG microphones were not built
with<00:01:47.530> spectral<00:01:48.530> analysis<00:01:49.310> they<00:01:49.759> built<00:01:50.030> them

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
with spectral analysis they built them

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.959 
with spectral analysis they built them
so<00:01:50.390> they<00:01:50.450> sounded<00:01:51.020> good<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.640> a<00:01:52.759> matter

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
so they sounded good and it's a matter

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.990 
so they sounded good and it's a matter
of<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.299> sound<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:54.430> there's<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.520> smoothness

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
of the sound and there's a smoothness

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.910 
of the sound and there's a smoothness
and<00:01:56.600> there's<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.369> characteristic<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:59.920> hello

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
and there's a characteristic that hello

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.310 
and there's a characteristic that hello
for<00:02:01.189> local<00:02:01.520> mics<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:02.000> are<00:02:02.090> very<00:02:02.270> good<00:02:02.539> though

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
for local mics that are very good though

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.099 
for local mics that are very good though
others<00:02:03.560> still<00:02:03.770> carefully<00:02:04.399> made<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:06.020> know

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
others still carefully made and you know

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.779 
others still carefully made and you know
there<00:02:06.350> are<00:02:06.469> still<00:02:06.740> people<00:02:06.950> with<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.310> factory

it's<00:02:34.210> why<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.410> studio<00:02:36.100> was<00:02:36.310> successful<00:02:36.940> I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
it's why the studio was successful I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780 
it's why the studio was successful I
upgrade<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.900> try<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.440> refine<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.340> try<00:02:39.580> and

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
upgrade and I try and refine and try and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.840 
upgrade and I try and refine and try and
improve<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.710> a<00:02:41.860> dedication<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.580> what

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
improve and it's a dedication to what

improve and it's a dedication to what
you're<00:02:43.090> doing<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.690> very<00:02:43.930> critical<00:02:44.530> and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
you're doing that's very critical and

without that if you're in business to

transistors and a few other things and

transistors and a few other things and
make<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> microphone<00:02:53.470> there<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.630> they<00:02:55.630> work

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
make a microphone there the they work

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.610 
make a microphone there the they work
but<00:02:56.620> they<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:56.920> no<00:02:57.130> spirit<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:59.320> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
but they have no spirit and it's the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.830 
but they have no spirit and it's the
spirit<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.310> I'm<00:03:00.790> looking<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:01.480> when<00:03:01.720> I

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
spirit that I'm looking for when I

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.500 
spirit that I'm looking for when I
listen<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.350> piece<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:02.650> equipment<00:03:03.510> AKG

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
listen to a piece of equipment AKG

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.530 
listen to a piece of equipment AKG
headphones<00:03:05.550> know<00:03:06.550> are<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.790> mainstay<00:03:07.330> of<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
headphones know are the mainstay of the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.900 
headphones know are the mainstay of the
studio<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:10.140> hate<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.170> say<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.610> I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
studio and I hate to say it but I can I

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.190 
studio and I hate to say it but I can I
can<00:03:13.090> get<00:03:13.210> repair<00:03:13.660> parts<00:03:14.110> pretty<00:03:14.460> pretty

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
can get repair parts pretty pretty

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.320 
can get repair parts pretty pretty
reliably<00:03:17.200> from<00:03:17.560> AKG<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.520> I<00:03:18.550> can<00:03:18.760> repair<00:03:19.150> the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
reliably from AKG so I can repair the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.160 
reliably from AKG so I can repair the
headphones<00:03:19.780> that's<00:03:20.380> why<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.860> them<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:22.170> did

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
headphones that's why I like them I did

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.590 
headphones that's why I like them I did
not<00:03:23.200> learn<00:03:23.620> engineering<00:03:24.190> by<00:03:24.910> sitting<00:03:25.390> through

a<00:03:25.660> couple<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.140> rock<00:03:26.350> sessions<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:28.390> know<00:03:28.480> do

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
a couple of rock sessions so you know do

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.260 
a couple of rock sessions so you know do
your<00:03:28.870> homework<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.760> no<00:03:30.760> matter<00:03:31.000> how<00:03:31.210> talented

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
your homework and no matter how talented

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.850 
your homework and no matter how talented
you<00:03:32.140> are<00:03:33.690> after<00:03:34.690> your<00:03:34.840> homework<00:03:35.110> go<00:03:35.470> home<00:03:35.650> and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
you are after your homework go home and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.110 
you are after your homework go home and
practice<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:37.200> there's<00:03:38.200> no<00:03:38.410> way<00:03:38.560> around<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.120> if

practice and there's no way around it if
there<00:03:40.390> were<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.930> would<00:03:40.959> have<00:03:41.230> found<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.770> because

there were I would have found it because
