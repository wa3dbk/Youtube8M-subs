your own one so make sure you go find
one<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.430> once<00:02:24.579> you've<00:02:24.700> set<00:02:24.879> that<00:02:25.230> go<00:02:26.230> under

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
case it's this address is probably going

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.030 
case it's this address is probably going
to<00:02:37.299> be<00:02:37.359> a<00:02:37.450> local<00:02:37.870> address<00:02:38.109> so<00:02:38.530> it'll<00:02:38.920> look

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
to be a local address so it'll look

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.209 
to be a local address so it'll look
similar<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.609> that<00:02:39.819> maybe<00:02:40.859> this<00:02:41.859> matter<00:02:42.040> if<00:02:42.129> it

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
similar to that maybe this matter if it

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.849 
similar to that maybe this matter if it
doesn't<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:42.670> answer<00:02:43.000> whatever<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:44.109> proxy

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
doesn't just answer whatever the proxy

doesn't just answer whatever the proxy
is<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.129> your<00:02:45.569> home<00:02:46.569> or<00:02:46.780> school<00:02:47.290> network<00:02:47.939> okay

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
is on your home or school network okay

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.379 
is on your home or school network okay
once<00:02:49.150> you've<00:02:49.299> done<00:02:49.419> that<00:02:49.480> under<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.470> SSH

accept connections on port 443 is

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.850 
accept connections on port 443 is

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
because some proxies block other things
