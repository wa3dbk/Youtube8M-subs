 we find ourselves on a new video 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.420
 on watchdoc this time all 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.029
 just because I found everything 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.220
 alone in my flight breach making a 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.720
 stunt then you understood it for 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.310
 do this guide you are going to have to do 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.679
 a stunt game it's crazy it's 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.449
 hard on wat job but good in the end 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.100
 we get used to it and it becomes great 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.660
 easy anyway I also wanted you 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.460
 to say that jean suitcases this video to the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.829
 click each one to do so I thank them 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.940
 from the heart if mulhouse for himself 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.649
 slide you are going to have to 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.989
 position here in the map in these 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:49.000
 little islands next to that pot next 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.350
 you will have to buy a motorcycle me 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.149
 I advise you to buy a bike 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.039
 will simply help you because 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.449
 if you miss the stun you will fall 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.789
 in the water and you will have to swim 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.620
 to the coast and find the bike 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.230
 so that's a bit boring as a result 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 you will have to climb the bridge and 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.030
 gain momentum for the sto mik 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.570
 fresh 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.300
 from that moment on you will have to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.100
 enable focus and try to 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.950
 put in the back wheel to touch this 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.190
 street lamp with your rear wheel and this 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.860
 street lamp will just project you 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.090
 directly above this building 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.490
 so loose 1 tell you people that 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.270
 you did the hardest thing in this 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.710
 bed that after with your bike you go 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.030
 have to go into this hole and there you 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 are going to be in a building 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.659
 the problem is we do not know 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.189
 shoot through the walls with 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.830
 submachine guns or from a bridge over 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.370
 all this but with the destroy hours on 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.720
 knows how to pull through the walls also for 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.720
 to have the destroyer you're going to have to 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.370
 do the 18 criminal escort and thanks 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.940
 on to leeds you will be able to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.080
 type in good bars with the cops 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.780
 unfortunately on fast and dead end 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.040
 then you're going to have to commit suicide and 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.510
