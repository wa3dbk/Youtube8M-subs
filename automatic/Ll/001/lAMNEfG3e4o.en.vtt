00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.070
 have burnt others together today 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.990
 I will do this for the first time 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 Try it yourself and I'm totally 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.969
 curious if that works and yes I show 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 Just do not do that and you guys 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.110
 there with a bit and I hope you 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 I like the video and I like it too 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.329
 the series so maybe you switched 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 next few days again and have the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 I am very happy 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.170
 and now have fun with you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.390
 even sugared almonds 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.020
 so now I have something first her all 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.239
 I had to do that and I did it here 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.379
 So a pack of sweet almonds 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.729
 That's 200 grams of sugar you have 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 also 200 grams 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.700
 then yes, then the water that 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.770
 Now 100 millimeters are a pack 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 vanilla sugar and a small pinch of cinnamon 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.540
 and to cool down then often somehow 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.000
 here you can get a tin or something 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.770
 yes and that's just what I have 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
 bit smeared with margarine 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.119
 this paper and then you only need 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.229
 drove and then it can actually 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.810
 already go 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:42.650
 The pan is hot and now 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.650
 comes the 200 gram sugar a terrorist 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:54.550
 a pinch of cinnamon and the water like that 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.770
 looks a bit disgusting on me now 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.630
 I read on the internet that one to 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.590
 rather we should take a wooden spoon 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.380
 do not really make sense now 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.160
 wooden spoon I take something like that now 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.080
 and the whole thing is cooking now 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.110
 bring 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:16.650
 yes in medium heat and yes do that 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.650
 just now 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.970
 the whole is often we turn on first 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:41.560
 Get down and stand now 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:44.920
 almonds yes, we leave that for so long 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.590
 cook until all the water evaporates 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.510
 evaporated and there just only the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.400
 almonds and sugar are left over 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.829
 as you can see or maybe 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.790
 The mass will not sink, either 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.620
 a bit more viscous, that is 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.840
 notices that the water is slow now 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.660
 really goes out 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.670
 I have to say all this share with it 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.200
 the water evaporates already takes one 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.120
 Well, I do not know how long I spent 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.730
 here stand 67 minutes maybe in 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.930
 By comparison, it has cooked but 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.220
 that a little bit longer now 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.700
 But I see a success and me 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.049
 believe because it is so far then only 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.049
 still the sugar left 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.040
 now it is really quite common 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.560
 all liquid is damned 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.379
 and I honestly do not know 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.280
 how long have I kept this in here 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.280
 must let 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.260
 I noticed that the sugar 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.220
 you may become liquid again 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.520
 see you here and now you have so long 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.950
 stir until yes to all make the 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.890
 people and the sugar added 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.340
 So really never stop 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.340
 hear 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:59.970
 and yes, the needy is not long 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.970
 take it until it's done 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.760
 I would say that's enough for me 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.940
 I do not want to do that too long now 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.250
 leave and now I give the whole 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:32.260
 just on the tin to make it nice 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:35.430
 can satisfy my is a scratch 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:39.390
 a bit of anja melted sugar out 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.950
 and then simply cancels with addition 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.950
 that would have spread a bit more 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.290
 already on the sheet and then it can 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.310
 first stop and stay that way 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.380
 nice cool 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.090
 Okay, people are welcome now 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.870
 and I'm honestly surprised 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.630
 how delicious are the simple but that 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.860
 super comparable to the 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.900
 Christmas market and the whole apartment 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.200
 just break on this sugar now 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.260
 cinnamon mixture or as delicious as that 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.680
 smells delicious again and yes I think 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:17.310
 It was really really great idea 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.230
 Somehow for friends then what else 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.420
 want to give christmas presents or 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.660
 just give it away as a christmas present 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.500
 then I think it's just right 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.290
 really nice 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:35.580
 it beats and just does something 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.050
 really cool and I would be happy 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:42.900
 if you could do it 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:45.450
 and all the stuff like the ingredients exactly 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.880
 The ingredients are again in the infobox 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.070
 if you are more of that , of course 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.810
 tasted simply looked after and when 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.460
 I would not do it to her 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:58.440
 really happy if you give me any photos 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:00.510
 post solution on facebook and you can 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.980
 also like to answer again and 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.990
 otherwise I would say 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.730
 see you tomorrow, so hopefully 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:10.730
 her landlord on and jan trains 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.730
 bye
