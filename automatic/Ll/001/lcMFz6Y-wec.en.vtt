00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.130
 Now I want to show you an example that 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.680
 I know that many will apply who does not 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.300
 He has a row of magazines in his house 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.360
 old women who do not know what to do with them 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.849
 They are obsolete and saw the re read 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.070
 rather are a hindrance and the 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.960
 magazines could be recycled but many 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.869
 sometimes their covers come plasticized 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.640
 and so slow to biodegrade 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.850
 Today I am going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.580
 practical clipboard we will need 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.160
 as a raw material the magazine paper 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.489
 so in this case I have used 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.379
 for this measure in specific two sheets 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:47.530
 of a large format magazine 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.460
 pen or pencil pins or pins 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.270
 Velcro 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.130
 paper scissors fabric scissors 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.330
 scalpel or cutter 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.330
 packing tape 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.930
 bias the color of your preference rule 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 and transparent contact paper 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.770
 how time on television is so 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.870
 valuable I have been given the task of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 bring prepared each step to 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.200
 step but I tell you 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.330
 basically cut this magazine and the other 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 that is to say we have cut two 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.240
 pages 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.140
 I show you then how it should look 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.290
 our sheet when cutting this is the idea 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.350
 when they do this process the page of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.360
 our magazine is going to look like this 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.730
 to be the skeleton the structure on 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.440
 which we are going to work and the other 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.620
 page 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.080
 I told them that I had already cut the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.240
 let's do totally in strips is 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.580
 say we do not leave it in structure with 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.190
 skeleton but we take one as 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.000
 skeleton and the other we cut all the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.980
 completely strips 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.860
 let's use a little tape 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.149
 as to help us make it the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.149
 I work a little massage 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.490
 thus 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.980
 let's paste here 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.319
 and now we're going to start braiding 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.740
 this way 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.160
 we passed one below 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.130
 one above is going to do it over here a 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.390
 below 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.390
 one above 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 one below 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.050
 one above we have our first 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.140
 braided row 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.450
 if here we start over in our 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.910
 second line we are going to do the process 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 Inverse, that is , let's pass the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.340
 first below this way 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.160
 let's go to our next step by step 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 that I already told you that I had prepared 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.380
 and the idea is that we will be left with this 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.800
 shape 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.690
 as you can see we braided the skeleton and 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.840
 We went through each of our 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.780
 pieces one above or one below 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.120
 so that our clipboard is more 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.920
 Compact will not break easy 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.890
 then let's give it a protection 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.620
 extra with this packing tape and it's 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.280
 very simple, look, let's paste it from 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.280
 this form 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.000
 to give us a little more 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.829
 body and rigidity does not have to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.540
 to be so perfect I know that you are 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.640
 a little more perfectionists than me 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.150
 but you are going to see that there is not so much 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.120
 problem because the idea is that this is 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.239
 will be in the internal part of 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.239
 our clipboard this is the idea 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.000
 it became more compact more flexible and now 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.730
 we will continue the process of 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.330
 sewing machine 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.580
 the bias and if you want in the 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.060
 inner part you can put a cloth 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.290
 waterproof or resistant I have brought a 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.760
 piece of fabric old man and now we are going to 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.760
 proceed to put our bias 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.350
 this bias I think it's going to give you a bit 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.070
 of joy 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.090
 extra our clipboard is going to see 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.090
 pretty pretty 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.599
 we take out of the machine 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.099
 is our bias put around 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.099
 the magazine and now we're going to cut 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.039
 this corner
