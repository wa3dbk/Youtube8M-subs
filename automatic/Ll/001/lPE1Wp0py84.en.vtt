host<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:02.820> for<00:00:02.939> Team<00:00:03.330> native<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.580> today<00:00:05.580> I

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
host here for Team native and today I

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.040 
host here for Team native and today I
was<00:00:07.020> playing<00:00:07.410> around<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.830> snapshot<00:00:08.340> and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
was playing around on the snapshot and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.330 
was playing around on the snapshot and
things<00:00:10.050> got<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.380> little<00:00:10.650> funky<00:00:11.099> not<00:00:11.519> gonna<00:00:11.730> lie

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
things got a little funky not gonna lie

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
things got a little funky not gonna lie
the<00:00:14.340> string<00:00:14.849> we<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.480> here<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.960> kind<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.800> wanted

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the string we got here I kind of wanted

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.460 
the string we got here I kind of wanted
to<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.310> what<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.520> could<00:00:17.670> do<00:00:17.910> if<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.779> was<00:00:18.930> off<00:00:19.140> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
to see what it could do if it was off of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.099 
to see what it could do if it was off of
the<00:00:19.980> trip<00:00:20.490> wire<00:00:20.730> hooks<00:00:21.210> whatever<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.960> want<00:00:21.990> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the trip wire hooks whatever you want to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.759 
the trip wire hooks whatever you want to
call<00:00:22.260> him<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.990> found<00:00:24.990> something<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:25.710> of

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
call him and found something kind of

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.279 
call him and found something kind of
cool<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:28.429> update<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.970> friggin<00:00:30.929> bud

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
cool out you can update a friggin bud

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.990 
cool out you can update a friggin bud
switch<00:00:33.110> just<00:00:34.110> by<00:00:34.200> stepping<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.000> thought

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
switch just by stepping on it I thought

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.229 
switch just by stepping on it I thought
that<00:00:36.090> was<00:00:36.180> pretty<00:00:36.300> cool<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.809> find<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.239> it

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that was pretty cool to find out and it

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.740 
that was pretty cool to find out and it
actually<00:00:39.510> gives<00:00:40.010> two<00:00:41.010> pulses<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.640> guess<00:00:42.540> when

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
actually gives two pulses I guess when

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.040 
actually gives two pulses I guess when
you<00:00:42.840> step<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:44.820> sends<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> pulse<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> when

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you step on it sends a pulse and when

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.439 
you step on it sends a pulse and when
you<00:00:49.140> step<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> sends<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> pulse<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you step off it sends a pulse and that

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.889 
you step off it sends a pulse and that
pulse<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:52.039> quickly<00:00:53.039> taken<00:00:53.579> back<00:00:53.789> now<00:00:54.149> with<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pulse is quickly taken back now with a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.069 
pulse is quickly taken back now with a
pressure<00:00:55.530> plate<00:00:55.710> obviously<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.870> just

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
pressure plate obviously you would just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
pressure plate obviously you would just
activate<00:00:58.770> the<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> piston<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.210> would

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
activate the the piston and it would

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.500 
activate the the piston and it would
just<00:01:03.359> stay<00:01:03.600> extended<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.420> don't<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
just stay extended so I don't know I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.640 
just stay extended so I don't know I
thought<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.990> pretty<00:01:07.140> cool<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
thought this was pretty cool and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.789 
thought this was pretty cool and
obviously<00:01:08.810> multiple<00:01:09.810> types<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.380> blood

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
obviously multiple types of blood

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.690 
obviously multiple types of blood
switches<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:12.409> used<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.770> actually

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
switches can be used with this actually

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
switches can be used with this actually
every<00:01:14.970> type<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.180> blood<00:01:15.420> switch<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.810> could

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
every type of blood switch you could

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.469 
every type of blood switch you could
think<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:17.549> course<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.150> has<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> hitbox

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
think of and of course it has a hitbox

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
think of and of course it has a hitbox
so<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.580> you're<00:01:20.729> using<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
so you know if you're using it for a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
so you know if you're using it for a
trap<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.500> you'd<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:23.070> wary<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
trap you know you'd have to be wary of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
trap you know you'd have to be wary of
that<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> stack<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.470> top<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> itself

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that so if you stack it on top of itself

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.870 
that so if you stack it on top of itself
put<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:28.250> now<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.460> still<00:01:29.700> see

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
put it right here now you can still see

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.219 
put it right here now you can still see
the<00:01:29.970> hitbox<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.600> walking<00:01:30.869> straight<00:01:31.079> ahead

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the hitbox just walking straight ahead

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.420 
the hitbox just walking straight ahead
but<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> does<00:01:32.189> activate<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> bud<00:01:32.759> switch<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
but it does activate a bud switch and

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.679 
but it does activate a bud switch and
just<00:01:35.430> thinking<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> some<00:01:35.880> quick<00:01:36.060> trap<00:01:36.329> ideas

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
just thinking of some quick trap ideas

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.160 
just thinking of some quick trap ideas
go<00:01:37.560> ahead<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.740> throw<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.570> dispenser<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.869> just

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
go ahead and throw a dispenser here just

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.109 
go ahead and throw a dispenser here just
have<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.650> long<00:01:40.799> dark<00:01:41.070> hallway<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
have kind of a long dark hallway and a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.490 
have kind of a long dark hallway and a
KaBlam<00:01:42.899> yeah<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:44.189> him<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.810> couldn't

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
KaBlam yeah you got him so I couldn't

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
KaBlam yeah you got him so I couldn't
really<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.100> anything<00:01:47.549> off<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> top<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
really think of anything off the top of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.580 
really think of anything off the top of
the<00:01:48.270> dome<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.409> too<00:01:49.590> cool<00:01:49.829> but

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the dome you know that was too cool but

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.030 
the dome you know that was too cool but
maybe<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.740> guys<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.509> send<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:55.200> video<00:01:55.470> maybe

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
maybe you guys can send this video maybe

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.940 
maybe you guys can send this video maybe
to<00:01:56.310> vex<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.820> etho<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.590> know<00:01:58.590> they're<00:01:58.829> both

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to vex or etho I know they're both

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.100 
to vex or etho I know they're both
working<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.310> new<00:01:59.399> maps<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:00.990> be

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
working on new maps and I think would be

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.330 
working on new maps and I think would be
kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> cool<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.500> they<00:02:01.740> implemented<00:02:02.070> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
kind of cool if they implemented this

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.660 
kind of cool if they implemented this
because<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.390> pretty<00:02:03.840> stealthy<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
because it is pretty stealthy it is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.570 
because it is pretty stealthy it is
taking<00:02:06.180> advantage<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> 1.3<00:02:07.829> statistics

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
taking advantage of the 1.3 statistics

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.240 
taking advantage of the 1.3 statistics
and<00:02:08.819> being<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.739> all<00:02:10.950> kinds<00:02:11.099> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and being that you know all kinds of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
and being that you know all kinds of
cool<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> could<00:02:12.090> even<00:02:12.180> put<00:02:12.420> lava<00:02:12.569> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
cool so that you could even put lava in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.370 
cool so that you could even put lava in
here
