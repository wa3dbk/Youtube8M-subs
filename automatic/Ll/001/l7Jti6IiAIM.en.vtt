00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
it's very good also to see how a team is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.190 
it's very good also to see how a team is
acting<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.700> difficult<00:03:25.150> moments<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.840> see<00:03:26.050> how

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
acting in difficult moments you see how

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.930 
acting in difficult moments you see how
people<00:03:26.590> try<00:03:26.740> to<00:03:26.770> work<00:03:27.070> together<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.610> find<00:03:27.850> a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
people try to work together to find a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.090 
people try to work together to find a
solution<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:29.050> think<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.560> also<00:03:29.740> a<00:03:29.890> very

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
solution and I think this is also a very

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.790 
solution and I think this is also a very
important<00:03:30.670> point<00:03:31.570> in<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.020> evolution<00:03:32.140> of<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
important point in the evolution of the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.040 
important point in the evolution of the
team<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.580> see<00:03:33.790> how<00:03:34.060> everybody<00:03:34.360> reacts<00:03:34.959> in

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
team to see how everybody reacts in

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.870 
team to see how everybody reacts in
difficult<00:03:35.500> times<00:03:35.650> how<00:03:36.070> stressful<00:03:36.400> they<00:03:36.730> also

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
difficult times how stressful they also

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.750 
difficult times how stressful they also
can<00:03:37.209> be<00:03:37.360> and<00:03:37.680> how<00:03:38.680> people<00:03:39.040> can<00:03:39.220> come<00:03:39.370> up<00:03:39.550> with

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.720 
can be and how people can come up with
very<00:03:39.970> creative<00:03:40.150> ideas<00:03:41.140> so<00:03:41.800> for<00:03:42.010> us<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.580> was<00:03:42.610> a
