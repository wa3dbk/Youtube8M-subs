00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you have to engage the rear wing and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.009 
you have to engage the rear wing and
because<00:02:14.430> plus<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.299> have<00:02:15.450> these<00:02:15.569> new<00:02:15.750> tires

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
because plus you have these new tires

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.309 
because plus you have these new tires
that<00:02:16.379> are<00:02:16.410> really<00:02:17.280> not<00:02:17.400> easy<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.790> use<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.720> I'll

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that are really not easy to use so I'll

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.900 
that are really not easy to use so I'll
be<00:02:19.500> real<00:02:19.769> surprised<00:02:20.160> there's<00:02:20.519> not<00:02:20.579> some

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
be real surprised there's not some

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940 
be real surprised there's not some

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
serious over takings you know probably

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.370 
serious over takings you know probably
one<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> most<00:02:23.340> exciting<00:02:23.640> races<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
one of the most exciting races the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.559 
one of the most exciting races the
public<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.190> st.<00:02:26.400> for<00:02:26.579> a<00:02:26.610> while<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.360> few

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
things here on the car in Melbourne I

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.770 
things here on the car in Melbourne I
think<00:02:29.430> we've<00:02:29.519> sold<00:02:30.000> all<00:02:30.180> our<00:02:30.209> reliability

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
think we've sold all our reliability

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.839 
think we've sold all our reliability
issues<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.129> you're<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:32.400> any<00:02:32.549> team<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
issues and if you're with any team that

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.539 
issues and if you're with any team that
can<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:34.530> improve<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.099> car<00:02:35.310> over<00:02:35.459> the

no<00:03:22.310> one<00:03:22.490> has<00:03:22.580> been<00:03:22.760> good<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.060> me<00:03:23.090> over<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.360> last

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
no one has been good to me over the last

no one has been good to me over the last
couple<00:03:23.780> years<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.770> would<00:03:24.860> be<00:03:25.010> amazing<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.430> get

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
couple years it would be amazing to get

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.520 
couple years it would be amazing to get
a<00:03:25.670> hat<00:03:25.820> trick<00:03:25.970> here<00:03:26.270> in<00:03:26.840> Melbourne<00:03:27.200> for<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
a hat trick here in Melbourne for the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.710 
a hat trick here in Melbourne for the
first<00:03:27.740> time<00:03:27.860> oh<00:03:27.980> I've<00:03:28.340> ever<00:03:28.550> done<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.720> so

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
first time oh I've ever done that so

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.960 
first time oh I've ever done that so
that's<00:03:30.620> got<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:30.860> be<00:03:30.950> mine<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:31.520> i<00:03:31.580> think<00:03:31.910> this

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
that's got to be mine but i think this

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.700 
that's got to be mine but i think this
year<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.240> probably<00:03:32.870> more<00:03:33.050> tricky<00:03:33.320> than<00:03:33.440> any

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
year is probably more tricky than any

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.740 
year is probably more tricky than any
other<00:03:33.890> year<00:03:34.130> because<00:03:34.550> fallen<00:03:35.360> one<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.600> so

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
other year because fallen one is so

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.540 
other year because fallen one is so
competitive<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.500> month<00:03:36.680> it's<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.400> long

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
competitive in the month it's a long

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.390 
competitive in the month it's a long
shot<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:37.820> uh<00:03:38.230> Never<00:03:39.230> Say<00:03:39.320> Never<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.950> that's
