using<00:01:06.200> we're<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> slice<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
using we're just going to slice down the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
using we're just going to slice down the
lines<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.500> also<00:01:10.500> we're<00:01:10.860> going

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
lines up and down and also we're going

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.040 
lines up and down and also we're going
to<00:01:11.280> unfold<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> slice<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.500> too

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.110 

all<00:01:20.650> right<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.280> tissue<00:01:21.460> paper<00:01:21.640> we're

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
all right so the tissue paper we're

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.910 
all right so the tissue paper we're
going<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.480> keep<00:01:22.600> folding<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:23.200> over<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.620> over

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
going to keep folding it over and over

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.470 
going to keep folding it over and over
again<00:01:24.010> so<00:01:24.370> that<00:01:24.460> way<00:01:24.730> we<00:01:24.880> can<00:01:25.030> get<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.240> whole

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
again so that way we can get a whole

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.780 
again so that way we can get a whole
bunch<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.780> parts<00:01:26.020> at<00:01:26.140> once<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.710> along<00:01:27.610> the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
bunch of parts at once and along the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.850 
bunch of parts at once and along the
folded<00:01:28.150> line<00:01:28.300> we're<00:01:28.690> going<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:29.050> cut<00:01:29.260> half<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.740> a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
folded line we're going to cut half of a

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.980 
folded line we're going to cut half of a
heart<00:01:30.070> when<00:01:30.910> you<00:01:31.000> unfold<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.540> you<00:01:31.570> should<00:01:31.840> get

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
heart when you unfold it you should get

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:41.520 
heart when you unfold it you should get
a<00:01:32.020> lot<00:01:32.230> of<00:01:32.380> parts<00:01:32.530> like<00:01:32.800> I<00:01:32.830> said<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:40.530> then

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
a lot of parts like I said and then

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.110 
a lot of parts like I said and then
repeat<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.890> same<00:01:42.130> process<00:01:42.220> with<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:42.940> other

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
repeat the same process with the other

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:53.010 
repeat the same process with the other
color<00:01:43.420> tissue<00:01:43.720> paper<00:01:51.420> okay<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.480> back<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.780> that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
color tissue paper okay so back to that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.600 
color tissue paper okay so back to that
shole<00:01:53.230> tube<00:01:53.470> on<00:01:53.650> we're<00:01:54.220> going<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.490> add<00:01:54.580> a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
shole tube on we're going to add a

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.010 
shole tube on we're going to add a
little<00:01:54.880> bit<00:01:55.060> more<00:01:55.090> detail<00:01:55.600> so<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.840> looks<00:01:55.960> like

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
little bit more detail so it looks like

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.900 
little bit more detail so it looks like
yeah<00:01:56.230> she<00:01:56.350> tried<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> little<00:01:57.010> bit<00:01:57.280> more<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.700> put

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
yeah she tried a little bit more and put

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.520 
yeah she tried a little bit more and put
more<00:01:58.060> time<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.420> effort<00:01:58.480> into<00:01:58.870> it<00:01:58.990> by<00:01:59.110> adding<00:01:59.470> a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
more time and effort into it by adding a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.410 
more time and effort into it by adding a
