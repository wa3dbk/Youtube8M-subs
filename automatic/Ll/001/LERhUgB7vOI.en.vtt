00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 agreement, the senators considered the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 excessive workload with certainty 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.439
 the project that was approved in the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 which was not the one that is not 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.800
 an agreement was reached between the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.860
 redirect 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.250
 after 11 hours uninterrupted even 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.559
 with the new text the discussion continued 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 30% of drivers are taking cocaine 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.350
 because they are forced to work beyond 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.650

 happy here 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.509
 quite the contrary I have respect 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.299
 I am aware that I also know 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.740
 perfectly what the driver 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.860
 represents the entire company 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.080
 until the drivers were divided 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 wanted to make the journey possible.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 they work harder but already 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.070
