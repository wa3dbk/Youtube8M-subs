in the garden and I'm testing out three
small<00:00:48.270> little<00:00:48.450> setups<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.200> use<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> on

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
small little setups that I can use so on

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.639 
small little setups that I can use so on
the<00:00:49.920> left<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.370> completely<00:00:51.410> blowing<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.530> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
I need so next up I've got two smaller

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
I need so next up I've got two smaller
LED<00:01:13.170> setups<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.950> wanted<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
LED setups here I wanted to see if I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.130 
LED setups here I wanted to see if I
could<00:01:14.909> achieve<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.270> same<00:01:15.479> thing<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> big

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
could achieve the same thing as the big

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.630 
could achieve the same thing as the big
five<00:01:16.439> hundred<00:01:16.770> watt<00:01:16.890> halogen<00:01:17.040> floods<00:01:17.490> up

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
five hundred watt halogen floods up

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
five hundred watt halogen floods up
there<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.509> LED<00:01:18.930> varnish<00:01:19.920> have<00:01:20.009> led<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
there but with LED varnish have led of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.219 
there but with LED varnish have led of
course<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.000> these<00:01:21.180> things<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.780> using

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
course is that these things are using

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
course is that these things are using
one<00:01:22.439> kilowatt<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> power<00:01:23.150> which<00:01:24.150> means<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.479> need

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
one kilowatt of power which means I need

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.320 
one kilowatt of power which means I need
to<00:01:24.689> run<00:01:24.869> their<00:01:25.049> own<00:01:25.400> power<00:01:26.400> cable<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
to run their own power cable out just to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.789 
to run their own power cable out just to
these<00:01:27.450> lights<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> can't<00:01:28.170> run<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.560> off<00:01:28.650> any

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
these lights and can't run them off any

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
these lights and can't run them off any
other<00:01:28.950> power<00:01:29.189> supply<00:01:29.630> which<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.659> which<00:01:31.079> makes

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
other power supply which is which makes

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
other power supply which is which makes
a<00:01:31.439> life<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.740> lot<00:01:32.100> more<00:01:32.159> difficult<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.880> then

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a life a lot more difficult but then

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.870 
a life a lot more difficult but then
again<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.600> give<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.350> bright<00:01:34.590> light

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
again they do give a really bright light

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
again they do give a really bright light
so<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> LED<00:01:36.210> array<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> first<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.229> here

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
so the LED array here the first one here

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.499 
so the LED array here the first one here
we've<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.189> American<00:01:38.610> DJ<00:01:38.790> mega<00:01:39.240> bar

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
we've just got an American DJ mega bar

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
we've just got an American DJ mega bar
so<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> mega<00:01:40.650> bar<00:01:40.860> isn't<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so the mega bar isn't actually that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
so the mega bar isn't actually that
bright<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.270> also<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.869> beam<00:01:43.079> angles<00:01:43.439> quite

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
bright and also it's beam angles quite

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
bright and also it's beam angles quite
narrow<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.369> only<00:01:44.549> actually<00:01:45.000> lighting<00:01:45.360> up

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
narrow so it's only actually lighting up

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.569 
narrow so it's only actually lighting up
a<00:01:45.750> small<00:01:46.439> area<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> garden<00:01:47.009> whereas<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a small area of the garden whereas the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.160 
a small area of the garden whereas the
flood<00:01:47.790> was<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> lighting<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.869> whole

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
flood was kind of lighting up this whole

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.219 
flood was kind of lighting up this whole
area<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.520> floodlights<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
area with the two floodlights so and it

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.630 
area with the two floodlights so and it
does<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> job<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.979> need<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> light<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> small

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
does the job if I need to light a small

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.980 
does the job if I need to light a small
area<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.329> probably<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.780> them<00:01:54.869> for

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
area but I probably use them for

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
area but I probably use them for
something<00:01:55.140> else<00:01:55.350> probably<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:56.009> light<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> wall

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
something else probably up light a wall

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.179 
something else probably up light a wall
inside<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> marquee<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.020> maybe<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.950> use

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
inside the marquee or maybe just use

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.980 
inside the marquee or maybe just use
them<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.939> wash<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> ceiling<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.899> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
them as a wash on the ceiling of the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.499 
them as a wash on the ceiling of the
marquee<00:02:01.579> so<00:02:02.579> next<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.909> sitting<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.270> top<00:02:03.390> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
marquee so next up sitting on top of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.209 
marquee so next up sitting on top of
that<00:02:03.570> really<00:02:03.750> tall<00:02:03.869> tripod<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> American

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that really tall tripod is the American

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
that really tall tripod is the American
DJ<00:02:05.399> dot<00:02:05.790> flood<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.140> there's

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
DJ dot flood and this I think there's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
DJ dot flood and this I think there's
actually<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.740> very<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.369> job<00:02:08.429> compared

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
actually a very very good job compared

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.210 
actually a very very good job compared
to<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> halogen<00:02:09.780> floods<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.470> it's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
to the halogen floods over here it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.339 
to the halogen floods over here it's
nowhere<00:02:11.400> near<00:02:11.550> as<00:02:11.730> bright<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:13.020> does<00:02:13.200> give

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
nowhere near as bright but it does give

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.720 
nowhere near as bright but it does give
a<00:02:13.379> nice<00:02:13.530> wide<00:02:13.800> coverage<00:02:14.220> if<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.400> spin<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a nice wide coverage if I spin the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.089 
a nice wide coverage if I spin the
camera<00:02:14.910> round<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.739> it's<00:02:16.890> doing

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
camera round here we can see it's doing

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.500 
camera round here we can see it's doing
a<00:02:17.160> fairly<00:02:17.370> decent<00:02:17.730> job<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.910> lighting<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.390> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
a fairly decent job of lighting up the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.559 
a fairly decent job of lighting up the
entire<00:02:18.540> garden<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:20.150> I've<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.360> really

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
entire garden here I've got a really

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.940 
entire garden here I've got a really
neat<00:02:21.720> little<00:02:21.900> way<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.290> mounting<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.739> dot

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
neat little way of mounting the dot

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.290 
neat little way of mounting the dot
flood<00:02:23.220> into<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.520> tripod<00:02:23.940> you'll<00:02:24.090> notice

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
flood into this tripod you'll notice

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.160 
flood into this tripod you'll notice
there's<00:02:24.450> no<00:02:24.540> t-bar

it's just mounted straight onto the top
and<00:02:26.790> what<00:02:26.879> I've<00:02:26.970> done<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.270> taken<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.599> speaker

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
dots flat on top of the tripod there now

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.680 
dots flat on top of the tripod there now
I<00:02:38.099> didn't<00:02:38.400> quite<00:02:38.610> fit<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> top<00:02:39.330> here<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I didn't quite fit on the top here this

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
I didn't quite fit on the top here this
is<00:02:39.810> actually<00:02:40.050> slightly<00:02:40.290> wider<00:02:40.709> diameter<00:02:40.950> than

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
is actually slightly wider diameter than

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.490 
is actually slightly wider diameter than
the<00:02:41.550> lighting<00:02:42.090> bar<00:02:42.239> tube<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.260> what<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.379> did

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the lighting bar tube here so what I did

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.020 
the lighting bar tube here so what I did
is<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:43.860> right<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.220> pity<00:02:44.370> gaffer<00:02:44.610> tape<00:02:44.640> around

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
is just right to pity gaffer tape around

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.759 
is just right to pity gaffer tape around
it<00:02:45.239> made<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> bit<00:02:45.750> thicker<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.230> just

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
it made it a bit thicker and just

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:47.960 
it made it a bit thicker and just
tighten<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.220> clamp<00:02:47.400> down<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:47.849> it's

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
tighten the clamp down on there it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.880 
tighten the clamp down on there it's
really<00:02:48.030> nice<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.510> secure<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.379> advantage<00:02:49.800> of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
really nice and secure the advantage of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
really nice and secure the advantage of
it<00:02:49.980> being<00:02:50.129> led<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.550> course<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.090> go<00:02:51.180> ahead

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
it being led of course as I can go ahead

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.600 
it being led of course as I can go ahead
and<00:02:51.510> change<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.930> color<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.379> go<00:02:53.220> down<00:02:53.400> here<00:02:53.430> to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
and change the color I go down here to

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.640 
and change the color I go down here to
my<00:02:53.700> wireless<00:02:54.060> foot<00:02:54.360> controller<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.930> DF<00:02:55.230> FC

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
my wireless foot controller the DF FC

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.589 
my wireless foot controller the DF FC
and<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.400> go<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.700> here<00:02:56.730> set<00:02:57.330> it<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.569> a

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
and I can go in here set it to be a

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.589 
and I can go in here set it to be a
static<00:02:57.780> color<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.409> then<00:02:59.010> scroll<00:02:59.310> through<00:02:59.599> and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
static color and then scroll through and

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.820 
static color and then scroll through and
there's<00:03:01.590> open<00:03:02.010> white<00:03:03.470> so<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.560> does<00:03:04.680> actually

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
there's open white so it does actually

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.729 
there's open white so it does actually
give<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.550> nice<00:03:05.700> bright<00:03:06.060> white<00:03:06.330> light

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
give a really nice bright white light

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.930 
give a really nice bright white light
nowhere<00:03:07.739> near<00:03:07.890> as<00:03:08.010> bright<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.790> big

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
nowhere near as bright as the big

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.119 
nowhere near as bright as the big
halogen<00:03:09.330> floods<00:03:09.599> but<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.560> does<00:03:10.709> do<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.890> very

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
halogen floods but it does do a very

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.160 
halogen floods but it does do a very
good<00:03:11.159> job<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.790> what<00:03:12.599> I'm<00:03:12.720> probably<00:03:12.870> going<00:03:13.080> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
good job so what I'm probably going to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.080 
good job so what I'm probably going to
do<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:13.560> I'll<00:03:13.739> end<00:03:13.890> up<00:03:13.950> using<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.400> big<00:03:14.640> halogen

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
do is I'll end up using the big halogen

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
do is I'll end up using the big halogen
floods<00:03:15.360> outside<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> marquee<00:03:16.409> to<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.950> light

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
floods outside the marquee to just light

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.070 
floods outside the marquee to just light
the<00:03:17.370> garden<00:03:17.700> area<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.209> people<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.989> easily

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the garden area so people can easily

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.509 
the garden area so people can easily
walk<00:03:19.379> in<00:03:19.560> now<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.920> marquee<00:03:20.280> without

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
walk in now to the marquee without

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.940 
walk in now to the marquee without
falling<00:03:20.849> over<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:22.290> dots<00:03:22.500> flood<00:03:22.769> I'll

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
falling over the dots flood I'll

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.440 
falling over the dots flood I'll
probably<00:03:23.099> put<00:03:23.310> inside<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.909> marquee<00:03:24.269> in<00:03:24.390> a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
probably put inside the marquee in a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.729 
probably put inside the marquee in a
corner<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.989> use<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.379> kind<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.620> my

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
corner and use that as kind of my

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.110 
corner and use that as kind of my
general<00:03:25.950> wash<00:03:26.310> light<00:03:26.580> for<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.819> entire

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
general wash light for the entire

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.180 
general wash light for the entire
marquee<00:03:27.599> I'll<00:03:27.930> probably<00:03:28.440> end<00:03:28.590> up<00:03:28.680> pointing<00:03:29.040> up

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
marquee I'll probably end up pointing up

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.589 
marquee I'll probably end up pointing up
at<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.340> ceiling<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.760> then<00:03:29.909> bouncing<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.480> back

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
at the ceiling and then bouncing it back

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.149 
at the ceiling and then bouncing it back
down<00:03:30.840> onto<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.140> tables<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:31.890> don't<00:03:32.069> have

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
down onto the tables so we don't have

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.619 
down onto the tables so we don't have
the<00:03:32.280> problem<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:33.060> bright<00:03:33.269> source

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
the problem of a really bright source

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.420 
the problem of a really bright source
because<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.620> light<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:34.950> actually<00:03:35.220> quite

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
because this light is actually quite

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.850 
because this light is actually quite
bright<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.879> look<00:03:35.909> at<00:03:36.349> and<00:03:37.349> then<00:03:37.440> as<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.650> said<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
bright to look at and then as I said the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.640 
bright to look at and then as I said the
mega<00:03:38.849> bar<00:03:39.030> here<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.599> dark<00:03:39.840> I'll<00:03:40.379> use<00:03:40.560> that

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
mega bar here in the dark I'll use that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
mega bar here in the dark I'll use that
something<00:03:41.010> else<00:03:41.190> I'll<00:03:41.280> probably<00:03:41.430> end<00:03:41.580> up

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
something else I'll probably end up

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.690 
something else I'll probably end up
using<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.180> up<00:03:42.299> lighting<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:44.220> anyway<00:03:44.519> why

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
using that for up lighting so anyway why

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.759 
using that for up lighting so anyway why
am<00:03:44.790> i<00:03:44.879> shooting<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.269> video<00:03:45.450> well<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.260> just

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
am i shooting this video well I just

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.570 
am i shooting this video well I just
thought<00:03:47.040> I'd<00:03:47.159> show<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.340> what<00:03:47.459> I'm<00:03:47.549> doing

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
thought I'd show you what I'm doing

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.610 
thought I'd show you what I'm doing
really<00:03:48.000> I'm<00:03:48.269> just<00:03:48.540> testing<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.959> setup<00:03:49.200> see<00:03:49.530> if

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
really I'm just testing you setup see if

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.199 
really I'm just testing you setup see if
they<00:03:49.739> work<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.280> mean<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.549> really<00:03:50.879> wouldn't<00:03:51.060> want

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
they work I mean I really wouldn't want

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.210 
they work I mean I really wouldn't want
to<00:03:51.239> go<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.599> gig<00:03:51.810> blind<00:03:52.200> without<00:03:52.890> really

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
to go to this gig blind without really

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.589 
to go to this gig blind without really
knowing<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:54.000> these<00:03:54.150> things<00:03:54.299> I'm<00:03:54.480> actually

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
knowing what these things I'm actually

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.330 
knowing what these things I'm actually
doing<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:54.989> dark<00:03:55.230> because<00:03:55.530> if<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.739> decided<00:03:56.129> to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
doing the dark because if I decided to

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.759 
doing the dark because if I decided to
use<00:03:56.519> these<00:03:56.730> American<00:03:57.689> DJ<00:03:57.840> mega<00:03:58.230> bars<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.739> just

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
use these American DJ mega bars and just

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.050 
use these American DJ mega bars and just
stuck<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.159> on<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.310> tripod<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.700> said<00:03:59.909> yeah

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
stuck that on a tripod and said yeah

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.250 
stuck that on a tripod and said yeah
that<00:04:00.239> was<00:04:00.390> fine<00:04:00.569> for<00:04:00.780> all<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.989> outdoor

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
that was fine for all the outdoor

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.229 
that was fine for all the outdoor
lighting<00:04:01.680> I'd<00:04:01.950> be<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> bit<00:04:02.640> stuck<00:04:02.909> so<00:04:03.090> it's<00:04:03.209> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
lighting I'd be a bit stuck so it's a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.820 
lighting I'd be a bit stuck so it's a
really<00:04:03.420> good<00:04:03.510> idea<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:04.140> test<00:04:04.409> now<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:04.709> your

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
really good idea to test now if your

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.440 
really good idea to test now if your
different<00:04:05.099> setups<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.849> actually<00:04:06.090> see<00:04:06.299> them

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
different setups and actually see them

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.119 
different setups and actually see them
in<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:07.049> location<00:04:07.500> they're<00:04:07.620> gonna<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.040> I

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
in the location they're gonna be in I

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.860 
in the location they're gonna be in I
mean<00:04:08.280> it's<00:04:08.430> not<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.909> actual<00:04:09.030> garden<00:04:09.569> but<00:04:09.720> it's

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
mean it's not the actual garden but it's

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.839 
mean it's not the actual garden but it's
still<00:04:09.959> outside<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.739> see<00:04:10.920> how<00:04:11.430> far<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
still outside you can see how far the

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.369 
still outside you can see how far the
light<00:04:11.970> goes<00:04:12.209> how<00:04:12.450> wide<00:04:12.689> the<00:04:12.870> spread<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.230> and

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
light goes how wide the spread is and

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.289 
light goes how wide the spread is and
how<00:04:13.439> bright<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.830> is<00:04:13.950> but<00:04:14.700> anyway<00:04:14.909> enough<00:04:15.000> about

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
how bright it is but anyway enough about

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.849 
how bright it is but anyway enough about
that<00:04:15.450> what<00:04:15.900> else<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.229> going<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.530> at<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.709> moment

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
that what else is going on at the moment
