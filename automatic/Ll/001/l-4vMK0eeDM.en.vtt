00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
first of all how to pinpoint so that you

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.100 
first of all how to pinpoint so that you
can<00:05:50.430> retrieve<00:05:51.119> the<00:05:51.419> target<00:05:51.839> with<00:05:51.990> the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
can retrieve the target with the

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.799 
can retrieve the target with the
smallest<00:05:52.439> hole<00:05:52.769> possible<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:54.419> best<00:05:54.629> way<00:05:54.779> to

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:54.809 
smallest hole possible the best way to

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.350 
smallest hole possible the best way to
do<00:05:55.019> that<00:05:55.169> is<00:05:55.349> to<00:05:55.469> practice<00:05:55.619> in<00:05:55.949> your<00:05:56.099> yard<00:05:56.360> by

do that is to practice in your yard by

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.920 
do that is to practice in your yard by
placing<00:05:58.079> the<00:05:58.769> the<00:05:59.490> coin<00:05:59.729> on<00:06:00.029> the<00:06:00.089> ground<00:06:00.659> and

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:04.499 
put a cloth over it turn around go back

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.920 
put a cloth over it turn around go back
out<00:06:04.860> detect<00:06:05.399> pinpoint<00:06:06.059> and<00:06:06.300> see<00:06:06.539> if<00:06:06.659> you<00:06:06.779> can

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
out detect pinpoint and see if you can

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.290 
out detect pinpoint and see if you can
touch<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.349> coin<00:06:07.589> with<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:07.829> screwdriver<00:06:08.300> find
