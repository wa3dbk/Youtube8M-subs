00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
for the neck nor tone which I only just

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.680 
for the neck nor tone which I only just
found<00:00:59.900> out<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:00.199> other<00:01:00.230> day<00:01:01.089> 3-way<00:01:02.089> toggle

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690

switch - got some passive pickups in it
I'm<00:01:06.500> going<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.710> probably<00:01:07.400> swap<00:01:07.730> them<00:01:07.880> out<00:01:07.940> for

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
I'm going to probably swap them out for

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
much why some of these the passive ones

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.330 
much why some of these the passive ones
this<00:01:15.260> is<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.479> h18<00:01:17.510> set<00:01:18.170> well<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.310> just

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
this is the h18 set well this is just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.190 
this is the h18 set well this is just
the<00:01:19.580> bridge<00:01:19.790> bridge<00:01:20.390> one<00:01:20.540> bubble<00:01:20.900> so<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.050> got<00:01:21.110> a

the bridge bridge one bubble so it got a
neck<00:01:21.350> one<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:22.690> might<00:01:23.690> keep<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.110> one<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:24.560> with

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
neck one I might keep this one just with

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.250 
neck one I might keep this one just with
passive<00:01:25.370> pickups<00:01:25.490> in<00:01:25.880> it

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
neck which again I'm not used to but

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.930 
neck which again I'm not used to but
yeah<00:01:33.410> it's<00:01:33.530> really<00:01:33.770> smooth<00:01:34.070> like<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.490> satin

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
yeah it's really smooth like a satin

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.000 
yeah it's really smooth like a satin
finish<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.480> then<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> really<00:01:36.410> nice<00:01:36.530> kind<00:01:36.800> of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
finish and then a really nice kind of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.300 
finish and then a really nice kind of
neck<00:01:37.640> join<00:01:38.030> there<00:01:38.300> this<00:01:38.540> super<00:01:39.170> smooth<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.620> my

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
neck join there this super smooth and my

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.020 
neck join there this super smooth and my
for<00:01:40.670> access<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.230> really<00:01:42.230> easy<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.640> scale

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
for access is really easy the the scale

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.660 
for access is really easy the the scale
length<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.510> actually<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.380> bit<00:01:45.830> longer<00:01:46.070> as<00:01:46.430> well

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
length is actually a bit longer as well

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.510 
length is actually a bit longer as well
on<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:46.940> one<00:01:47.090> I<00:01:47.120> think<00:01:47.180> it's<00:01:47.390> 25<00:01:47.840> inch<00:01:48.220> neck<00:01:49.220> so

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
on this one I think it's 25 inch neck so

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.730 
on this one I think it's 25 inch neck so
getting<00:01:50.210> used<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.660> bit<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.050> um<00:01:51.200> I've
