either way I'm my first fingers barely

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.520 
either way I'm my first fingers barely
touching<00:02:56.240> that<00:02:56.360> low<00:02:56.540> e<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.930> mute<00:02:57.110> that<00:02:57.140> out

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
touching that low e to mute that out

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.710 
touching that low e to mute that out
because<00:02:57.770> I'm<00:02:57.980> strumming<00:02:58.430> hard<00:02:58.670> here<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.510> if<00:02:59.630> I

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
because I'm strumming hard here and if I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.410 
because I'm strumming hard here and if I
don't<00:02:59.780> it's<00:03:00.050> going<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.290> go<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:02.150> don't<00:03:02.240> want

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
don't it's going to go you don't want

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.290 
don't it's going to go you don't want
the<00:03:02.510> open<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.870> them<00:03:03.020> and<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> high<00:03:04.250> e<00:03:04.310> I've<00:03:05.090> got

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
the open in them and the high e I've got

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.060 
the open in them and the high e I've got
that<00:03:05.480> muted<00:03:05.810> with<00:03:05.930> my<00:03:06.080> index<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:06.620> probably

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
that muted with my index I probably

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.860 
that muted with my index I probably
won't<00:03:07.220> hit<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.580> but<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.910> it's<00:03:08.209> muted<00:03:08.630> so

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
won't hit it but if I do it's muted so

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.270 
won't hit it but if I do it's muted so
muting<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.350> just<00:03:09.560> as<00:03:09.650> important<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
muting is just as important it's the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.410 
muting is just as important it's the
chord<00:03:10.580> you're<00:03:10.790> playing<00:03:10.820> all<00:03:11.239> right

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
chord you're playing all right

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.510 
chord you're playing all right
so<00:03:12.140> we're<00:03:12.260> going<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.410> go<00:03:12.590> we're<00:03:13.280> gonna<00:03:13.400> hit

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
so we're going to go we're gonna hit

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.180 
so we're going to go we're gonna hit
this<00:03:13.670> side<00:03:13.910> it's<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.120> C<00:03:14.330> major<00:03:14.510> chord<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.190> then

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
this side it's a C major chord and then

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.080 
this side it's a C major chord and then
we're<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.459> to<00:03:16.489> move<00:03:16.640> up<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.910> whole-step

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
we're going to move up a whole-step

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.979 
we're going to move up a whole-step
sharp<00:03:17.660> two<00:03:17.900> five<00:03:18.170> seven<00:03:18.739> seven<00:03:18.950> seven<00:03:19.550> and

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
sharp two five seven seven seven and

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.300 
sharp two five seven seven seven and
it's<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.080> fast<00:03:21.350> thing<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.800> we're<00:03:21.950> gonna<00:03:22.040> want<00:03:22.250> to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
it's a fast thing so we're gonna want to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.490 
it's a fast thing so we're gonna want to
upstroke<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.790> up<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:27.230> then<00:03:27.320> hit

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
upstroke that so we up and then hit

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.460 
upstroke that so we up and then hit
another<00:03:27.590> up<00:03:27.950> stroke<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.330> then<00:03:29.510> then<00:03:29.720> repeat

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
another up stroke and then then repeat

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.550 
another up stroke and then then repeat
that<00:03:30.680> three<00:03:31.459> more<00:03:31.670> times<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.060> it's

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.700 

another<00:03:38.250> thing<00:03:38.460> okay<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.970> want<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:39.330> show<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.710> my

wondering what that's doing you don't
have<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.430> do<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.350> security<00:03:49.350> on<00:03:49.590> my

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
have to do that it's a security on my

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.480 
have to do that it's a security on my
muting<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.120> finger<00:03:51.530> which<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.890> don't

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
muting that if this finger which I don't

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.820 
muting that if this finger which I don't
even<00:03:53.670> think<00:03:53.850> about<00:03:53.940> doing<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.780> or<00:03:55.080> this<00:03:55.440> it's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
even think about doing this or this it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.310 
even think about doing this or this it's
become<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> habit<00:03:56.570> I've<00:03:57.570> tried<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.990> show<00:03:58.020> my

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
become a habit I've tried to show my

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.470 
become a habit I've tried to show my
private<00:03:58.680> students<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.850> know<00:03:59.970> putting<00:04:00.270> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
private students you know putting the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.950 
private students you know putting the
middle<00:04:00.720> finger<00:04:00.930> there<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.860> problem<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.610> I'm

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
middle finger there the problem is I'm

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.540 
middle finger there the problem is I'm
in<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.050> beginning<00:04:04.470> stages<00:04:04.740> usually<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
in the beginning stages usually the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.790 
in the beginning stages usually the
student<00:04:06.360> winds<00:04:06.570> up<00:04:06.690> pushing<00:04:07.050> too<00:04:07.200> hard<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.650> it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
student winds up pushing too hard and it

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.360 
student winds up pushing too hard and it
ends<00:04:08.010> up<00:04:08.070> ringing<00:04:08.400> with<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.730> cord<00:04:08.970> incoming

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
ends up ringing with the cord incoming

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.700 
ends up ringing with the cord incoming
so<00:04:11.370> it's<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.970> fine<00:04:12.180> line<00:04:12.390> between<00:04:12.570> disaster<00:04:13.470> and

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
so it's a fine line between disaster and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.479 
so it's a fine line between disaster and
beauty<00:04:14.670> okay<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.770> you<00:04:16.890> can<00:04:17.010> practice<00:04:17.460> that

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
beauty okay so but you can practice that

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.070 
beauty okay so but you can practice that
with<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.910> middle<00:04:18.120> finger<00:04:18.150> but<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:18.930> you're

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
with the middle finger but if you're

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.420 
with the middle finger but if you're
handling<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.500> with<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.800> index<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.280> you're

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
handling it with this index and you're

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.580 
handling it with this index and you're
confident<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.600> know<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:22.260> takes<00:04:22.500> a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
confident with that you know it takes a

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.930 
confident with that you know it takes a
while<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.800> get<00:04:23.040> used<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.790> establish

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
while to get used to it to establish

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.030 
while to get used to it to establish
that<00:04:24.420> habit<00:04:24.810> okay<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.500> then<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.830> next

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
that habit okay and then this next

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.560 
that habit okay and then this next
little<00:04:26.310> riff<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.580> reminds<00:04:26.910> me<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.120> Zeppelin

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
little riff this reminds me of Zeppelin

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.330 
little riff this reminds me of Zeppelin
for<00:04:27.840> sure<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.200> goes

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.159 

and<00:04:35.610> what<00:04:35.759> it<00:04:35.849> is<00:04:35.879> is<00:04:36.270> three<00:04:36.569> five<00:04:36.810> on<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.139> a

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
and what it is is three five on the a

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.589 
and what it is is three five on the a
and<00:04:38.090> then<00:04:39.090> three<00:04:39.360> five<00:04:39.569> three<00:04:39.599> on<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.259> D<00:04:40.440> and

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
and then three five three on the D and

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.890
