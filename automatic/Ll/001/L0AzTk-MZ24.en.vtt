00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
I never do when I install these I've

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.460 
I never do when I install these I've
installed<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.160> bunch<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.609> them<00:00:30.109> but<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> do

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
installed a bunch of them but if you do

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.310 
installed a bunch of them but if you do
it<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.890> this

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260 

they<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.100> stick<00:00:38.489> until<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.970> push

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they don't really stick until you push

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
they don't really stick until you push
it<00:00:40.170> isn't<00:00:40.470> like<00:00:40.590> you're<00:00:40.770> gonna<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.220> close

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it isn't like you're gonna get it close

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.390 
it isn't like you're gonna get it close
and<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.850> gonna<00:00:42.739> stick<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.220> be

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
and it's gonna stick and you're gonna be

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.600 
and it's gonna stick and you're gonna be
in<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> wrong<00:00:44.760> position<00:00:46.220> since<00:00:47.220> they<00:00:47.370> fit

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in the wrong position since they fit

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.939 
in the wrong position since they fit
into<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> recessed<00:00:48.329> areas<00:00:48.870> okay<00:00:49.650> so<00:00:49.710> you're

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
into the recessed areas okay so you're

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.549 
into the recessed areas okay so you're
gonna<00:00:50.040> want<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> put<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.610> uh<00:00:51.140> your<00:00:52.140> visors

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
down out of the way it kind of slides up

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.579 
down out of the way it kind of slides up
underneath<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.720> first<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> see

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
underneath this first and as you can see

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.549 
underneath this first and as you can see
with<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> lot<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.839> place<00:01:04.199> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
with these there's not a lot of place so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.760 
with these there's not a lot of place so
you're<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.890> gonna<00:01:05.900> go<00:01:06.900> Center<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
you're just gonna go Center it where it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.499 
you're just gonna go Center it where it
needs<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:13.580> push<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.910> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.300> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
needs to go I push up a little bit to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
needs to go I push up a little bit to
get<00:01:15.660> it<00:01:15.810> kinda<00:01:16.140> stuck<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:17.970> gonna

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
get it kinda stuck and then I'm gonna

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.620 
get it kinda stuck and then I'm gonna
take<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.450> board<00:01:18.690> from<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.800> can<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
take my board from right here I can I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.810 
take my board from right here I can I
can<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:22.310> press<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
can get a good press right in the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
can get a good press right in the
backside<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.660> but<00:01:25.440> then<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
backside of this but then to get this

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.029 
backside of this but then to get this
rough<00:01:26.310> part<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.320> always<00:01:28.320> climb<00:01:28.649> out<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
rough part I always climb out of the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.370 
rough part I always climb out of the
Jeep<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.580> then<00:01:30.000> playing<00:01:30.300> like<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.259> way

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
Jeep and then playing like this that way

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.270 
Jeep and then playing like this that way
I<00:01:31.410> could<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> leverage<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:34.039> push<00:01:35.039> up

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I could I have the leverage to push up

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
I could I have the leverage to push up
hard

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.499 

but<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.400> key<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.880> stuff<00:01:43.180> that

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
but that is the key to this stuff that

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
but that is the key to this stuff that
this<00:01:44.229> 3m<00:01:44.650> tape<00:01:44.890> sticks<00:01:45.280> really<00:01:45.909> really<00:01:46.210> good

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this 3m tape sticks really really good

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.310 
this 3m tape sticks really really good
as<00:01:48.100> long<00:01:48.490> as<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.850> push<00:01:49.060> up<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.720> harder<00:01:50.170> it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
as long as you push up that harder it's

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.679 
as long as you push up that harder it's
pushed<00:01:50.619> up<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.860> better<00:01:51.190> it's<00:01:51.369> gonna<00:01:51.520> stay

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.530 

the<00:01:55.689> fact<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.700> usually<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:57.820> sticks<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.330> good

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
the fact is usually it sticks so good

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.999 
the fact is usually it sticks so good
it's<00:01:58.750> almost<00:01:59.020> impossible<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.710> pull<00:01:59.920> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
it's almost impossible to pull the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.350 
it's almost impossible to pull the
panel's<00:02:00.340> out<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.729> want<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.970> be<00:02:01.030> able<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.240> get

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
panel's out you want to be able to get

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.660 
panel's out you want to be able to get
them<00:02:01.450> out<00:02:01.539> if<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.810> want<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:03.039> other<00:02:03.159> side<00:02:03.250> is

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
them out if you want the other side is

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.749 
them out if you want the other side is
exactly<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.330> same<00:02:04.539> way<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:06.190> we<00:02:06.220> don't<00:02:06.610> really

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
exactly the same way so we don't really

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.619 
exactly the same way so we don't really
need<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.030> show<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.869> that's<00:02:08.440> it
