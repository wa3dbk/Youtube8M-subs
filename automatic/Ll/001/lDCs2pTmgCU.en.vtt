00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.899
 he has been abused still at a very great distance he was divided and suddenly 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:08.179
 I was opening three groups of lights in the sky 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.719
 at the same time because I was telling the operator that I was 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.920
 seeing multiple signals but now I see three of them separated by 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.940
 approximately 50 kilometers 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.680
 they have very strong signals appear like a triangle on the screen every time 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.680
 more people pointed is something quite unusual 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 surprisingly since they are possessing with their radar screen what the officer of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.800
 Ugandan police and another witness report to 911 operator 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.340
 they went up and down at high speed has never seen anything that moved so 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.320
 Quick 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.710
 one hour I have multiple signals 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.389
 this object is divided into three 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:50.930
 there are three or four light the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.090
 when high average speed in terms of policy in the country 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.320
 what you had that night were objects doing things that actually 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.230
 planes can not do it is also hot 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.360
 I never saw that round curves come like an airplane would 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.160
 they were jumping from one place to another and always at a right angle as in a 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.300
 sign of the trace of the objects for almost two hours watching how they moved to 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 speeds higher than those of any conventional aircraft 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.720
 there are 13 4500 up to 15 millimeters I could not believe that the ones that was so high the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.570
 height range indicator showed multiple aspects too many for 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390
 count them several dozens 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.560
 as a spot on the visitor arch extending at least 50 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 kilometer 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.000
 finally put he can not keep chasing the objects and these 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.160
 disappear 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.150
 the supposed young UFO never had an explanation on the part of the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.720
 authorities 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.090
 if the federal aviation administration in chicago observed those 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.440
 objects never recognized it 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.380
 in fact according to the fa it is not possible to verify what 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.880
 such as shampoo are you knew when you did your drawings the idea destroys your 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.029
 files every six months 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.769
 I do, I would be something and I have never seen anything like it before 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.159
 fourteen years after the event 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.609
 bush that still stands firm 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.639
 what the monitorio on the radar was not an airplane 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.859
 nor can the anomalies be attributed to the conditions 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.619
 atmospheric 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.639
 we have radar information corroborated by eyewitnesses 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.689
 the 911 calls we have two bridges of information completely 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.730
 independent 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.989
 that corroborate the version 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.959
 it's exciting the interview the professor held 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.730
 contrasted in this interview with jackson fit the story perfectly 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.730
 has not changed in 14 years 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:59.529
 no matter what appeared above all in michigan on March 8, 1994 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.929
 on the contract of the combo on December 14, 1994 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.309
 and about multiple cities in southern Illinois on January 5, 2000 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:14.099
 police officers the 911 and the radar operators looked 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.479
 involved in unexplained events and exposed them to the world's attention 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.839
 also the idea arises that the ships maybe there have been related to 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.059
 somehow 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.549
 but some candy is a big object whatever it is 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.900
 when it comes to a systemic effect that is occurring in several states and 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:32.999
 federal agencies 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.539
 it's hard to ignore 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.039
 because many of these witnesses are trained observers their 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.639
 credibility is even greater and that makes these cases so convincing 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.049
 I'm impressed with the size of these ships are immense bright 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:46.699
 floating 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.699
 they are suspended in the air disappearing at breakneck speed 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.290
 and where they can come parked and who is behind all this 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.770
 now the evidence in video and digital images 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.200
 provide first glimpses of what those witnesses observed 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.549
 could simply be advanced military vehicles that have not yet been 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.769
 revealed 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.019
 these are alien spaceships attracting ordinary citizens 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.559
 as my god 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.079
 the team has discovered new and important facts and research
