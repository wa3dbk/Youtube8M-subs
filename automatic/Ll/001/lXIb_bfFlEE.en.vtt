 and percent of coach people there because there at the same time because 

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:25.269
 I heard about her because I knew 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.390
 the link she had with with the particular neighborhoods north and thunderstorms

 2 there are elected outgoing a lot of elected as outgoing and the important 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.180
 it's about presenting women so 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 the ump and decided to introduce women 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840
 in a lot of normal dempster circumspection 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.440
 that I am a substitute and that I should not help him and in addition I find 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.730
 legitimate that 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.590
 in politics of renewal people want to identify with elected officials what we 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.390
 request it's politics we always think it's for the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 the enarchs and and those who did the landais studies 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.790

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.300
 his compatriots and paradoxically made his dynamism and view what she wants 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.180
 damascus and so I will have I am with her and we redo the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.890
 neighborhoods it will be fine 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.990
 and on the ground precisely stop it first that you put forward in this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.210
 are the ideas of the npa and the desire to see how the two are organized 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.780
