when I Drive this Lexus it's a constant

when I Drive this Lexus it's a constant
reminder<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.810> I<00:01:01.020> need<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.560> in<00:01:01.710> tune<00:01:02.040> with

my<00:01:02.489> inner<00:01:02.850> Zen<00:01:03.710> because<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> way<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.070> drive<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
my inner Zen because the way you drive a

my inner Zen because the way you drive a
car<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.090> more<00:01:06.360> important<00:01:07.050> than<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> car

car is more important than the car

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
itself what I mean is you can drive a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
itself what I mean is you can drive a
hybrid<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.850> aggressively<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.200> wouldn't

hybrid very aggressively and it wouldn't

hybrid very aggressively and it wouldn't
be<00:01:13.650> any<00:01:13.800> better<00:01:14.070> than<00:01:14.190> driving<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.910> SUV

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

something<00:02:05.170> really<00:02:05.380> unique<00:02:05.860> about<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.280> CT

something really unique about the CT

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.449 
something really unique about the CT
200h<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:07.659> its<00:02:07.930> rear<00:02:08.110> view<00:02:08.319> camera<00:02:08.769> it's<00:02:09.340> not

200h is its rear view camera it's not

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.880 
200h is its rear view camera it's not
located<00:02:10.300> on<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.660> dash<00:02:10.869> by<00:02:11.140> any<00:02:11.319> means<00:02:11.500> instead

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
located on the dash by any means instead

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.710

it's actually in the rear view mirror

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.479 
it's actually in the rear view mirror
and<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.790> makes<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.569> lot<00:02:16.989> easier<00:02:17.489> to
