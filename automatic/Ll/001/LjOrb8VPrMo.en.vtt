00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
start to adventure bike riding 6.1

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.529 
start to adventure bike riding 6.1
gallon<00:00:46.360> fuel<00:00:46.660> tank<00:00:47.100> 21<00:00:48.100> inch<00:00:48.340> front<00:00:48.460> wheels<00:00:49.059> so

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
gallon fuel tank 21 inch front wheels so

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.360 
gallon fuel tank 21 inch front wheels so
these<00:00:49.750> things<00:00:50.079> really<00:00:50.770> make<00:00:51.070> a<00:00:51.100> big

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
these things really make a big

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.610 
these things really make a big
difference<00:00:51.520> to<00:00:51.820> adventure<00:00:52.300> riding<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:53.410> any

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
difference to adventure riding in any

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.590 
difference to adventure riding in any
off-road<00:00:54.190> terrain<00:00:54.430> so<00:00:54.940> it's<00:00:55.090> much<00:00:55.270> better

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
off-road terrain so it's much better

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.319 
off-road terrain so it's much better
than<00:00:56.219> adventure<00:00:57.219> bikes<00:00:57.399> with<00:00:57.610> smaller<00:00:57.940> front

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
than adventure bikes with smaller front

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.930 
than adventure bikes with smaller front
wheels<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.350> it's<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.070> motorcycle<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:00.699> you<00:01:00.760> can

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
wheels so it's a motorcycle that you can

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.299 
wheels so it's a motorcycle that you can
really<00:01:01.180> tick<00:01:01.629> on<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.109> off-road<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:02.800> overall

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
really tick on and off-road and overall

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.150 
really tick on and off-road and overall
it's<00:01:03.550> been<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.730> decent<00:01:03.969> motorcycle<00:01:05.130> take<00:01:06.130> a
