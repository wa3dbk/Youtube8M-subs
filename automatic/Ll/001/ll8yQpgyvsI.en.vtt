00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.940
 control the speed of the next cooler 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.140

 another course you can add kikoler 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.430

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.350
 this side here she notified the wires 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.360

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.979
 that mess and the office is 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.840
 really very good the staff that does 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.580
 make a nice pc and do not have that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.039
 messy things that inhabit you 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.430
 put a cool motherboard on a board 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:32.419

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.690
 right here and now with this one is the 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.630
 cooler to be 200mm or so 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.479
 20 to 20 mm this is already here with the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.759
 cabinet that obviously abc ex lyon is 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.229
 This kid that has how you control 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.949
 the fifth for example I can decrease here 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.830
 O 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.880
 I can even stop the club from stopping 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.770
 run here 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.750
 here you can control this issue of 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.639
 temperature and also the noise issue 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.050
 but this club here is very quiet 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.180
 you can leave it at the most time 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.400

 in the middle of the game you can stay 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.930
 quiet is how you monitor 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.180

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.880
 there are 35 degrees really is so one 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.470
 very good system is thus optimized 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.509
 not to get too hot at the same 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.880
 time all the red like that but it's just 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.770
 the beauty of the cabinet 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.690

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.849
 even teams have raised a lot of money and 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.130
