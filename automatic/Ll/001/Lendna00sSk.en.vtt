00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello everyone or chicken and in this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 video tutorial we are group settings 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.910
 ads entered key words and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.219
 negative words i'll tell you how 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.230
 you need to write and , accordingly, we also 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.350
 words and why you need to break detailed 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.789
 into a group and how to do it how to break 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 correct keywords on groups 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.810
 drove means previous video we 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 you picked up in the previous two videos 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.480
 selected words and negative words 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.840
 and we already have a ready plate with 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 matched 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 keywords are not a bunch and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.940
 negative words all I can do 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.750
 do it now just copy them 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.390
 and when creating a group led 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 and I'll just bring them here in the window 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 where we have a keyword field on 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.230
 accounts i only have keywords about 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 oars to buy oars and oars for the boat 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.850
 protect the most frequently requested words 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.539
 buble left therefore in order not to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.129
 get confused in your account in these groups 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.060
 ads I am now an ad group 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.890
 Immediately and call as buy paddles at all 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.900
 I recommend you always so yes because 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.450
 so you will be very easy to manage 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.659
 if you want to find for example these words 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.180
 and ads then now the box is related 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 to this word you will not need 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 shovel the whole account and seek out 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 holding on is you immediately looking at 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.440
 structure is just an advertising campaign 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 ads immediately find this group 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.160
 for the account I have a group buy a paddle 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 create ads that are missing the well 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.740
 there is no possibility to increase the text 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.800
 ads and ads usually create 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.590
 further on when the group is created 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.550
 and you just need to enter 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.090
 text ads on bills now 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.950
 we will process ours 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 negative words what to do with them 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.650
 There are several types of matching 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.290
 keywords and now I have the words 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.610
 written in broad match types 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.380
 broad match type implies 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.729
 the fact that your words will not be shown 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.390
 only by this word which 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.209
 wrote about associative words and this is not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.200
 always positive because for example i 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.800
 I sell very 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.250
 advertisements may be shown by motors 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.860
 for boats we have already discussed that in 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.780
 In this case, if your customer wants to buy 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.010
 paddles and you sell motors 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.170
 or vice versa, the client is looking for a motor in search 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.260
 and you show him advertising fun she 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.470
 he is not interested in the first, he will not 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.140
 it click the second if even u click 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.670
 he will not see the motors there and most likely 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.130
 and quickly leave the site without having made 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.519
 nor any purchase of you a per click and for 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.680
 the bottom of the plates means therefore wide type 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.900
 matches which have no characters at all 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.110
 any keywords i could 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.600
 do not recommend and I recommend 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.209
 you put such magic pluses here 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.110
 every negative words that everyone 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.430
 keyword which mean do 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.000
 from ordinary words 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.410
 required words for example in this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.380
 milling buy a paddle 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.900
 two words with a plus sign it means that if 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.090
 the user will write just a paddle 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.560
 advertising will not see but if he asks 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.700
 for example buy a paddle in Kiev 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.739
 there or 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.660
 on troyeschina anywhere that is here there is 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.069
 I will buy phrases in spring 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.190
 campaigns will seem in the case of 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.860
 pretexts plus signs to put excuses 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.739
 do not need it in this way prepositions 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.569
 All and official words are missing and if 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.480
 put your pluses as a pretext and 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.269
 make them mandatory but not all 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.890
 users write 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.319
 prepositions when asked anything in 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.970
 google and very often we see there 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.920
 requests for example sushi delivery and not in 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.099
 Kiev and sushi delivery Kiev, that is, I 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.780
 hurried her try to reduce the time on 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.470
 some actions now i will put 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.670
 plus sign and to all words and continue with 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.670
 him islam 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.729
 it I would become a plus sign to all key 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.009
 words and added the word buy again 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.319
 paddle derived from buy channel and 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.360
 Gleason shop you never know who will be so 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:49.910
 ask at least the statistics of this is not 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:54.509
 It was but I will add suddenly there will be rumors 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.819
 all list is ready for ordinary words until 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.130
 rather to the service word dots not worth 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.319
 only the obligatory words are not 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.090
 need to make phrases of four five words 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.229
 for those who are very long 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.909
 someone will ask 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.440
 usually phrases of four or 5 words 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.599
 reality away it is very rare not 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.699
 decide don't even make a group 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.009
 ads 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:19.349
 go ahead and here we have substituted 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.240
 default bid per click which we 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.690
 assigned on the advertising settings 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.669
 campaigns generally how to assign cost 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.759
 I usually put you will cost on 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.199
 peephole and then I already look at the statistics 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.569
 advertising campaign if an ad 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.550
 shown in the top 3 means you can 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.159
 reduce if you do not reach the top 3 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.360
 need to understand but in such a way to find 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:48.020
 it is further here I click indicate 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:52.229
 billing details later here and turn to 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.050
 setting up companies already in the interface i 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.759
 ad groups and already with this 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.610
 interface, you will continue to work 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.650
 constantly means my company status 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.169
 company for 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.470
 because it starts tomorrow and you're here 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:08.020
 on the keywords tab you have 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:11.240
 functionality to add 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.639
 negative keywords besides negative keywords you can 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.699
 add at the level of the whole account but in 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.789
 In this case, I do not need it, I will 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:21.860
 add negative words only to mad 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.930
 topics accordingly i will add them on 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:29.539
 Ad Group Level Means Copying 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:34.250
 all your negative keywords matched in advance 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:36.289
 and just insert any in the list 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.560
 signs to the minus words worth not need 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:42.350
 just save this list 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.090
 here is this negative group level 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.860
 ads but these were words on 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.110
 campaign level if you have any 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.330
 common words this picture is free 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.580
 all steel write them down at the level 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.660
 Companies for example, I will now add on 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:02.030

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:05.080
 words peak photo photo photos all 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.490
 save on this job exactly with 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.080
 setting negative keywords end 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.880
 there are absolutely no secrets 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.370
 the only rule you need 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.210
 Negative words match each group 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.630
 ads 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.490
 you can not miss any because well 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.800
 where you do not put the word menu there 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.400
 you will lose your budget 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:29.060
 in vain and in the next video we are with you 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.550
 set up a text ad for this 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.870
 I will tell the group 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:36.370
 secrets to creating common fictitious 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.370
 ads not switching
