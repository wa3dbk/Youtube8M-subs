00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.620
Hi, I'm Pallavi,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.980
The look I'm about to show you

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.800
is really clean and simple,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.020
and it's perfect for a modern, confident woman.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.280
It's a look you can take from a boardroom

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.300
to a coffee shop. . .

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.500
to lunch with the girls.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.760
It's one you can wear anytime, anyday!

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.120
And it should take you less than 10 minutes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.180
to achieve!

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.120
To show you this look, I'm going to use

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.840
the 'Pure Passion' range of cosmetics from Studio West

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.800
by Westside.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.440
To get started,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.200
over a moisturised face,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
I'm going to use a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.500
Flawless Finish Foundation, by Studiowest.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.580
What I love about this foundation, is that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.660
it's something that you can build up from really sheer finish to a medium coverage finish.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.540
I recommend that you take a good amount of your foundation,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.040
and begin by using it in the center of your face,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.560
blending outwards.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.220
What this will do is, it'll highlight and brighten the area of your face,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.500
that is naturally catching light.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.360
While it recedes into the darkness on the rounded corners of your face.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.180
You don't really need much foundation here,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.820
because every time you put too much foundation on the absolute edges of your face,

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.220
it'll appear like a mask.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.900
This is a great trick to use, especially when you have a foundation

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.180
that's quite close to your skin but not a true match.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.800
And also, it brightens and creates a base for all the colour cosmetics

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.280
which normally are compact and in the center of the face:

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.540
for your eye makeup, for your blush, for your lips.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.300
And as you can see, even at the end of this application

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.060
the face is looking flawless and all the redness has gone

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.960
but there is still a sense of a very polished and finished look.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.520
Make sure that, if you're wearing something as open as this, you want to take,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.960
the foundation down a little bit.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.700
Just to make sure, there's a kind of evenness between the face and neck.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.080
And before you apply powder, just make sure you give it a second,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.500
so the moisture rests, and then you set it with powder.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.340
To set the foundation, I'm going to use a Flawless Finish Compact.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.020
I'm going to use it with a brush because I really want just to mattify the skin,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.240
and not really apply a powder.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.460
So I'm just going to dust the powder along the bottom of her eye,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.220
on both sides, the center of her face, on her nose,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.840
upper lip, chin and along the neck because you have some product there as well.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.500
When you hear the word 'Compact', you normally think that it's just a foundation,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.740
but that's not true.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.460
Compact is actually the casing in which several products can come,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.200
so there are cream compacts, there are cream foundation compacts

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.920
powder foundation compacts and setting powders.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.640
This happens to be a setting powder which you can build to a semi coverage finish.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.320
So her base is done, and I'm going to get started with the eyes.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.460
It's really the simplest eye makeup you can do.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.800
I'm going to use a palette called Daytime Neutrals.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.260
As you can see, the colours are really quite skin like, and not very shimmery,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.620
although they do have a bit of sheen.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.720
I'm going to start with this very 'biscuit-y' looking colour, right here like a wheat.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.740
And take it on a blending brush, because I don't want to pack the colour on

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.080
and make it look too silvery.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.660
So I'm just going to take a small amount of that and sweep it all across her lid.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's literally to brighten the lid.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.260
So just make sure, you don't work it into the crease,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.480
work it right up until the crease.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.320
Very softly, so you just get a small amount of sheen.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.020
So if you take a look at it closely, you can see that it's almost like it's your own skin

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.760
that has been really well moisturised.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.120
And that's it, no more fuss, it's as simple as that.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.100
I'm going to choose a nice chocolate brown as a liner, because I think

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.700
brown liners are something that most of us tend not to use

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.140
because I think as Indians, what we do have, is quite a bit of pigmentation around the eyes

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.560
and we do tend to believe that brown can, you know, kind of blend with that,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.540
and make our eyes look dull.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.580
But I'm going to show you a brown that would work really well for you.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.320
So here's the roll-up kohl pencil, that can be worn inside and outside the eye

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.520
So just a touch of liner on the upper waterline,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.960
and a small amount of brown just in the corner just to tie the eye together.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.100
So not too far into the eye, just the corner.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.740
This also opens up the eyes,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.220
very soft smudge.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.220
I'm just going to repeat on the other side.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.940
So that's really simple, and once the eyes are done,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.840
I'm going to put a thin coat of mascara, you don't want too much mascara for the day,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.180
and especially if you have great lashes.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.260
Just enough to define the hair.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.540
Yeah, and none on the bottom lashes because there's going to be a little more colour

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.540
in terms of cheeks and a pretty mouth.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.880
So that's great for, you know a quick look for the eyes.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.000
I'm going to get on with a blush.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.760
Again, I'm going to keep it really sheer, so no shaping, nothing!

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.780
This blush is called 'Dusty Rose'.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.740
Just going to use a small amount of it,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.440
along her cheeks, so start with the apple of the cheek.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.520
and work it towards the hairline.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.180
To finish off, I'm going to use a long wear lipstick, by Studiowest,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.780
it's called Apricot Blush.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.680
In spite of being a long wear product, it doesn't tug and pull at your skin.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.900
It's very intensely moisturising and hydrating,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.380
and the colour stays opaque and soft on your lips through the day.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.380
Now the thing is with a look like this, which is quite muted and understated,

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.360
you can choose to wear a bright mouth even at work.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.158
It shouldn't matter if you choose even a nice subtle red or

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.100
something with an undertone of red,  or brick or something like that.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.280
I'm just keeping it soft and fresh with this peachy colour.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.460
As you can see, this look is easy as pie to achieve.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.600
