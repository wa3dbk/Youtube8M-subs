00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.880 

got<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> question<00:00:02.100> about<00:00:02.870> how<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.929> throttle

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
got a question about how the throttle

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.740 
got a question about how the throttle
linkage<00:00:05.190> on<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> three<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.450> half<00:00:06.540> four

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
linkage on a three and a half four

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.320 
linkage on a three and a half four
sprigs<00:00:07.080> 92<00:00:08.150> 908<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.469> this<00:00:10.469> one's<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.830> 92<00:00:11.309> 502<00:00:11.820> but

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
sprigs 92 908 or this one's a 92 502 but

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.150 
sprigs 92 908 or this one's a 92 502 but
as<00:00:13.110> far<00:00:13.320> as<00:00:13.349> your<00:00:13.469> throttle<00:00:13.769> linkage<00:00:14.040> is

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
as far as your throttle linkage is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.530 
as far as your throttle linkage is
concerned<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.759> all<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> same

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
concerned it's all the same

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.410 
concerned it's all the same
so<00:00:16.139> basically<00:00:16.529> your<00:00:17.220> throttle<00:00:17.760> linkage<00:00:18.180> from

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
so basically your throttle linkage from

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.779 
so basically your throttle linkage from
the<00:00:18.510> governor<00:00:18.960> consists<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.460> long

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the governor consists of this long

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.330 
the governor consists of this long
spring<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.900> link<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.500> this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
spring and the link and this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.779 
spring and the link and this
funny-looking<00:00:24.060> side<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> link<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.789> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
funny-looking side of the link here it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.050 
funny-looking side of the link here it
goes<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:28.349> governor<00:00:28.890> arm<00:00:29.130> as<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.670> can

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
goes in the governor arm as you can

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.150 
goes in the governor arm as you can
hopefully<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.529> there<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:33.320> then<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.950> other

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
hopefully see there and then the other

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.470 
hopefully see there and then the other
end<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> link<00:00:36.200> goes<00:00:37.200> into<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> throttle

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
end of the link goes into the throttle

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.450 
end of the link goes into the throttle

you<00:02:15.730> need<00:02:15.910> something<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.450> space<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.790> gas<00:02:19.000> tank

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
you need something to space the gas tank

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.450 
you need something to space the gas tank
there<00:02:19.540> or<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.960> can<00:02:20.350> break<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> lug<00:02:21.040> right<00:02:21.280> off

there or you can break the lug right off
the<00:02:21.610> gas<00:02:21.790> tank<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.330> then<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.570> useless<00:02:24.000> but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the gas tank and then it's useless but

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.170 
the gas tank and then it's useless but
anyways<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.710> hope<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.130> helps<00:02:28.090> you

anyways so that I hope that helps you
out<00:02:28.240> there<00:02:28.570> and<00:02:28.780> how<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.680> linkage<00:02:30.130> goes<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
out there and how the linkage goes the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.810 
out there and how the linkage goes the
main<00:02:31.600> thing<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.870> course<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.380> just<00:02:32.820> getting

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
main thing of course is just getting

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.540 
main thing of course is just getting
this<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.250> guy<00:02:36.490> here<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.120> the

governor correctly and then you know

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.880 
governor correctly and then you know
feeding<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.600> spring<00:02:43.900> around<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.440> end<00:02:44.650> and

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
feeding the spring around that end and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.460 
feeding the spring around that end and
this<00:02:45.340> spring<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:46.960> see<00:02:47.110> here<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
this spring as you can see here the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.470 
this spring as you can see here the
spring<00:02:47.770> loops<00:02:48.280> around<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.320> loop<00:02:50.320> on<00:02:50.590> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
spring loops around the loop on the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.699 
spring loops around the loop on the
throttle<00:02:52.480> linkage<00:02:52.600> there<00:02:53.050> maybe<00:02:53.410> it's<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
throttle linkage there maybe it's a

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.380 
throttle linkage there maybe it's a
little<00:02:53.800> more<00:02:54.040> visible<00:02:54.459> on<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.820> one<00:02:55.000> but

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
little more visible on that one but

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
little more visible on that one but
anyway<00:02:56.170> that's<00:02:56.500> how<00:02:56.650> he<00:02:56.770> goes<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:59.170> to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
anyway that's how he goes so just to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.620 
anyway that's how he goes so just to
want<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.980> show<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.430> how<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.270> linkage

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
want to show you how the the linkage

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.920 
want to show you how the the linkage
goes<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.140> on<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.350> three<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:02.920> a<00:03:03.010> half<00:03:03.130> horse

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
goes there on a three and a half horse

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.559 
goes there on a three and a half horse
