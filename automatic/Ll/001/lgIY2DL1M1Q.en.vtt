from this film so I mean those two
actors<00:02:19.329> didn't<00:02:19.900> do<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> bad<00:02:20.170> job

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
actors didn't do a bad job

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.949 
actors didn't do a bad job
I<00:02:20.769> personally<00:02:21.430> watch<00:02:21.849> this<00:02:22.120> film<00:02:22.330> mainly

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
I personally watch this film mainly

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.720 
I personally watch this film mainly
because<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.560> guy<00:02:23.680> from<00:02:23.920> angels<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.610> it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
because the guy from angels in it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.550 
because the guy from angels in it
because<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.569> liked<00:02:25.840> angel<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> think<00:02:26.470> is

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
because I really liked angel I think is

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.130 
because I really liked angel I think is
a<00:02:26.620> pretty<00:02:26.739> good<00:02:26.860> TV<00:02:27.129> show<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.720> besides<00:02:29.020> that

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
a pretty good TV show but besides that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
a pretty good TV show but besides that
the<00:02:29.349> acting<00:02:29.650> wasn't<00:02:30.010> too<00:02:30.160> bad<00:02:30.340> but<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> think

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the acting wasn't too bad but I think

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.520 
the acting wasn't too bad but I think
those<00:02:31.150> are<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.599> know<00:02:31.690> obviously<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.349> two

those are you know obviously the two

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.740 
those are you know obviously the two
best<00:02:32.770> actors<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.730> film<00:02:33.910> let's<00:02:34.510> talk<00:02:34.629> about

he wears black gloves and it's just a
simple<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.569> effective<00:02:46.690> look<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.860> killer

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
simple but effective look for the killer

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.180 
simple but effective look for the killer
I<00:02:48.370> hate<00:02:49.360> when<00:02:49.750> horror<00:02:50.140> movies<00:02:50.500> try<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.860> make

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
I hate when horror movies try to make

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.190 
I hate when horror movies try to make
their<00:02:51.370> killers<00:02:51.760> look<00:02:51.940> like<00:02:52.120> mock<00:02:52.360> over<00:02:52.690> Jason

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
their killers look like mock over Jason

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.259 
their killers look like mock over Jason
with<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.769> one<00:02:53.980> he<00:02:54.129> has<00:02:54.220> his<00:02:54.430> own<00:02:54.459> distinct<00:02:55.090> to

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
with this one he has his own distinct to

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.059 
with this one he has his own distinct to
look<00:02:55.480> about<00:02:55.720> him<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.470> that's<00:02:56.769> just<00:02:56.860> what

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
look about him and that's just what

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.650 
look about him and that's just what
makes<00:02:57.160> him<00:02:57.370> unique<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.030> lot<00:02:58.209> Kelly<00:02:58.420> wasn't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
makes him unique and a lot Kelly wasn't

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.360 
makes him unique and a lot Kelly wasn't
trying<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.019> duplicate<00:02:59.590> Jason<00:03:00.220> or<00:03:00.340> Michael

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
trying to duplicate Jason or Michael

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.720 
trying to duplicate Jason or Michael
like<00:03:00.819> I<00:03:00.940> said<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:03.040> way<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.519> killer

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
like I said so the way that the killer

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.850 
like I said so the way that the killer
looks<00:03:04.000> he<00:03:04.209> looks<00:03:04.239> freaky<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.080> simple<00:03:05.650> I

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
looks he looks freaky but it's simple I

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.040 
looks he looks freaky but it's simple I
like<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:07.180> kills<00:03:07.480> are<00:03:07.720> actually

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
like that the kills are actually

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.900 
like that the kills are actually
probably<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.470> best<00:03:08.739> part<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.550> whole<00:03:09.730> film

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
probably the best part of the whole film

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.750 
probably the best part of the whole film
like<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.300> kills<00:03:10.569> are<00:03:10.720> always<00:03:11.050> creative

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
like the kills are always creative

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.670 
like the kills are always creative
there's<00:03:12.760> one<00:03:13.030> simple<00:03:13.360> kill<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.349> know<00:03:14.470> when

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
there's one simple kill you know when

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.479 
there's one simple kill you know when
they're<00:03:14.830> in<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.099> morgue

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
they're in the morgue

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.820 
they're in the morgue
this<00:03:16.330> girl<00:03:16.569> hides<00:03:16.810> in<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> body<00:03:17.230> bag<00:03:17.319> and<00:03:17.530> you

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
this girl hides in a body bag and you

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.290 
this girl hides in a body bag and you
know<00:03:17.890> he's<00:03:18.040> just<00:03:18.159> well<00:03:18.459> in<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.730> way<00:03:18.879> boom

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
know he's just well in a way boom

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.930 
know he's just well in a way boom
hitting<00:03:19.810> body<00:03:20.080> bag<00:03:20.349> after<00:03:20.650> body<00:03:21.040> bag<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.670> us

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
hitting body bag after body bag and us

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.880 
hitting body bag after body bag and us
the<00:03:22.269> viewers<00:03:22.599> we<00:03:22.810> didn't<00:03:23.110> see<00:03:23.230> which<00:03:23.409> body<00:03:23.650> bag

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
the viewers we didn't see which body bag

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.949 
the viewers we didn't see which body bag
she<00:03:24.099> got<00:03:24.280> in<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:24.940> kind<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.239> suspenseful

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
she got in so it's kind of suspenseful

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.979 
she got in so it's kind of suspenseful
but<00:03:26.709> he<00:03:26.860> finally<00:03:27.129> does<00:03:27.430> he<00:03:27.760> goes<00:03:27.909> boom<00:03:28.480> gets

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
her that was pretty good

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.500 
her that was pretty good
I'm<00:03:32.470> probably<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.860> most<00:03:32.920> simplest<00:03:33.519> one<00:03:33.819> but

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
I'm probably the most simplest one but

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.630 
I'm probably the most simplest one but
after<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.200> he<00:03:35.409> have<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:35.800> know<00:03:35.920> he<00:03:36.250> takes<00:03:36.459> his

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
after that he have you know he takes his

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.460 
after that he have you know he takes his
crime<00:03:36.970> not<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.239> crossbow<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:38.019> bow<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.319> arrow

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
crime not a crossbow but a bow and arrow

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.280 
crime not a crossbow but a bow and arrow
and<00:03:38.739> boom<00:03:39.459> shoots<00:03:39.879> this<00:03:40.090> girl<00:03:40.330> three<00:03:41.019> times
