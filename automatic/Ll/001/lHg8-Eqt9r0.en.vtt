00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.270
 the great success of the 90s like me nobody 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.850
 he has loved 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.750
 let's see what our jury thinks 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.670
 alejandro of them john e 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.710
 you still have to work a little 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.740
 closes because your closures always 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.970
 they always know me little I think that well 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.460
 work well the closures especially 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.529
 when you figure down and there's one thing that 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.170
 I'm more worried that you're still far away 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.699
 of the character beyond the intent that 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.520
 I was doing it's like you 're not 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.680
 feeling joon bon jovi even then you 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.260
 voice still does not sound real sounds 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:39.519
 too feigned it sounds like a 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.559
 imitation still very very little polished yes 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.820
 worth the term then I ask you for 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.340
 please work more in this 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 personification because you're staying 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.050
 very separate from the original character 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.670
 I like your intensity I like the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.649
 voice I feel it seemed like that you have to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.699
 polish some things but I see that you go 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.519
 by very good way 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.860
 you have the attitude you have that energy in 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.729
 the stage really for me what 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.729
 you did very well tonight 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.890
 it remains difficult when an artist 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.730
 Anglo-Saxon tries to interpret a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.560
 song in Spanish and try to give it 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.030
 practically the necessary clarity and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 something that pleased me a lot is that you 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.500
 you even got to do these 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.050
 Americanized average imports that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 I did in the year 95 is the second 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.440
 opportunity that he had to make a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.210
 song in Spanish and I think it was not 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.530
 nothing bad and for me this that had this 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.530
 I liked that night and a lot 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.280
 the score if I can prove a bit 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.530
 it was really I think it's 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.540
 far removed from the voice of consob 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.580
 and I do not know you say the perfect 8 but 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.990
 it's as if you do not hear the bon jovi no 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 because of that band it hurts us to say 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.620
 that I 'm disqualifying you 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.600
 score is no longer telling you what 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.119
 you say if it's right it's not right 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.119
 my opinion goes electoral idle 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.319
 and you do not have to work yet a 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.849
 Little is missing work but it is 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.970
 I see good way with a good attitude 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.970
 and I've seen an incredible improvement
