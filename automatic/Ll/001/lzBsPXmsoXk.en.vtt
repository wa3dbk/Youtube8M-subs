00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.490
 analyze dangerous diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, tuberculosis, influenza 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.800
 some fungal viruses and bacteria is the work of clinical chemists 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.740
 laboratory of the general hospital of the state these diagnostic assistants 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.740
 doctor stuck inside a laboratory are anonymous heroes because without their 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.930
 work the work of the doctors would be extremely complicated the laboratory 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.089
 hospital incentive 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.550
 I drive we manage all the staff there all that are rivers with brushes 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 bodily 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.530
 come from all the services you handle, external consultation manages your agencies and 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.560
 everything that raises lists 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.410
 hospitalization are all services practically you are him 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.210
 the concentration of everything that is the general hospital with the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.880
 different diagnostic diseases 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.100
 and risks inherent to Monday 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.820
 cc in application the standard and you go modifying knows when and requesting 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.940
 to the authorities in compliance with hygiene safety manuals 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.150
 that what we have to do as chemists now you see the chemists 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.080
 they all work with robes 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.070
 currently with two goals 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.050
 compuware mouths with their gloves 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.490
 inclusive for certain sampling the logical cumbión that are of risk 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.690
 like the flu shots because you have to go with a special dress 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.900
 and everything is disposable 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.790
 we all know already that in that they do not prepare reactive mine everything is 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.530
 the silver enology of tip mine transform all this that does not want 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.340
 to say that you do not have your responsibilities in these risks 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.390
 also with clinical stays 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.810
 but those issues have already been totally minimized and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.880
 of getting involved in other things you won us going to uncover thus face it before 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.950
 of destroying transportation 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.730
 something that we are or not 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.610
 for everything already done and has not modified 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.580
 everything that was us díez or of the profession 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.549
 which are enough for 28 clinicians 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.469
 three secretaries and a technician is composed of laboratory personnel 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.179
 The general hospital of the state is divided into eight departments 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.209
 In addition to the teaching and quality area 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.959
 currently each of the laboratory chemists has a team 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.140
 security personnel consisting of gloves masks disposable costumes and 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.189
 other additions the arrival of the latest technology came to transform 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:32.250
 the way of laboratory work increasing the accuracy and speed 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:37.040
 minimizing the risks for staff analyzing a single sample led to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.059
 average one full hour 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.629
 each chemist analyzed the average of 10 to 15 samples daily 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.790
 because the passing of the years did not reach 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.659
 to innovate all this to go modifying 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.230
 there are people who had other things the hospital grew in the hospital it 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.179
 modified without smoke 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.079
 and then my laboratory could not be left behind 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.829
 in the laboratory it had to be according to the needs of what he earns 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.899
 the general population in Latin America 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:07.899
 and so it was that as a laboratory worker he was transforming 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.150
 and based on that applies everything that were measures of 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.569
 of security because then nobody we all had we pointed out that it was in 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.879
 that time when only 180 votes more or less 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:25.709
 and before we saw the patients so they deteriorated that they wanted 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.969
 were individual aplastic anemia nobody thought about what was a 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.049
 eta disease that even 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.730
 they did not take the samples with gloves before it was live shows in order 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.329
 be 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.659
 because I had government the security that we have now for all that is the 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.169
 management of biological risks 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.739
 thanks to a fortune to mention the application of rules to us having 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.349
 what 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.979
 be according to the hospital stick to the medical area and the processes of 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.309
 certification what centers a quality control 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.099
 you have to transform you 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.479
 totally transforming and turning the 360 ​​degree profession 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:04.699
 and to become what we are or not
