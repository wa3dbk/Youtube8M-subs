00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.059
 ok bye to all the guys that came into this 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.410
 new people of today are here a nis among peoples 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.509
 because we are here because I find myself 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.940
 legendary si nissim issimo zekrom 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.380
 then it rained because in the spring 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.420
 pepper always head north to north 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.210
 of coach opoli until you reach the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.130
 dragon tower blows just arrived 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.160
 we'll see we'll see 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.900
 the father of professor aralia who 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.690
 he says we have not yet managed to understand 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.670
 nothing of the dragon tower blows as possible 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 what you see to the reals are the same basis 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.129
 of the mystery of the tower itself we see 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.730
 that you approach gas park or if here 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.010
 you too two years ago on this tower the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.809
 guy faces a bit like that guy 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 he pursued ideals he wanted to change the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.379
 world 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.480
 exactly the one that rises majestically in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 bottom of the street and the tower was conspire is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.260
 an ancient tower erected before 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.609
 again that I was not founded 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.210
 it is said that the pokemon dragon 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.790
 legendary waited at the top tower 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.970
 the advent of the one who sought the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.799
 ideals and so it was 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 but that's the dark quarrel I understand then 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 even if you want to go up 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.540
 at the top of the tower you also print it 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 I don't think of alpetta to change the world 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.580
 it is possible but to change oneself 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.189
 the one so admitted that one was willing to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.200
 continue their ideals or excuse not 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.820
 I was going to talk things over 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.590
 depth yesterday there is nothing better 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 of something sweet in these cases 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 devil gets sweet gato we put in 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.030
 bag is fine then the next e 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.520
 we see that if we go now we access the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.369
 big tower when we first arrive 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.340
 here I added a member of ours 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.909
 shake ride because we will need it for 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.610
 paralyze zekrom zekrom per cent 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.829
 a hundred are afraid that air France is not there 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 succeeds so I decided to insert him 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:07.460
 so let's go so far 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.009
 we also take ball 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.470
 we will need it then we will continue 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.830
 now this is the first time then 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.000
 let us take all the stone objects 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.310
 brillo quite useful protein object 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.160
 it is not that we need much, however, always 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:32.390
 better than nothing and let's continue by di 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:38.780
 so then let's read you now for these 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:41.900
 stairways and beyond then the first ball 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 the second gray sphere is splendid 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.690
 the third to a sphere these spheres 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.060
 they serve to empower the types of the gods 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.489
 pokémon respectively stages a deal 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.190
 wrathful stages or algae in practice you 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.989
 you do keep it and moves for example of 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.480
 pal who knows that being dragon water 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.480
 those of algae will be increased by being 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.840
 being drawn steel menter year and le 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.810
 the power of the moves type of turned into 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.850
 being between prospectuses they will increase 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.160
 so we have already climbed so much we see 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:25.280
 here that there is a little what is there is a 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:29.660
 comet piece and went up to many can if there 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.920
 I can bo and then here we are 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.590
 the effect of the repellent to where 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.180
 they will be another one ok and let's get closer 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.620
 with care and see 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.870
 the dark she is moving inside 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.239
 of the bag can pull it out 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.370
 no boys not our double meanings name 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.019
 but it's okay then after the fact that 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.760
 we pulled it out we see what time 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.709
 the dark quarrel is absorbing the aura of 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.420
 everything around you 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.070
 the darkness absorbs paula who is there 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.700
 around it turns it into an energy 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.930
 powerful in an instant releases it 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.910
 let's see a beautiful action now 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.430
 really beautiful look a little 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.910
 zekrom beautiful just beautiful a nice one 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.910
 pokémon 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.030
 is throwing rays shaken super 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:18.079
 powerful I do not know what that is 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.930
 doing and is now slightly vibrating 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.630
 and here is the majestic zero then 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.180
 I would say to save because I do not want not 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:32.419
 I want him to die absolutely absolutely ok 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.780
 save ok and now let's go talk to 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.970
 the powerful 0 bank roush open to 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.630
 mouth really scared 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.880
 ok now we send hold being having 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.000
 a really high defense will resist 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.990
 to all his moves between scrolls 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.990
 look to hurt guys 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.630
 I thought it would do much to tell me a lot about 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.220
 less instead we have it anyway 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.419
 time to use fake cannon that 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.030
 however it is not very effective but 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.380
 the important thing is that it paralyzes him because 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.840
 scyths that you haven't talked about it ever since 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.960
 one hundred percent earthquake uses 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:14.930
 exclusive we use earthquake and 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.520
 uses in perfect light croton that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.039
 capons we use at the next pokémon 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.039
 we send bosses and we can start 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.510
 throw the ultra balls for sure a 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.320
 thousand per thousand that we capture it at 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.210
 first come on 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.570
 enter the first 0 while entering enters 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.860
 enter enter one or boys captured 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.289
 first try guys lol 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.550
 ok i got it right on this and see 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.900
 now that n 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.880
 if chrome has recognized your value 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.470
 considers you the number is just like that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.330
 will you coach me will change the world 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.190
 a message for you go to the pits 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.830
 giant closes it back to me has it 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.479
 a friend of mine told the world that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.610
 wishes for little will definitely not 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.180
 a world with the engine I look forward to 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.550
 being able to live there makes a strange nod 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.930
 day there will be no need for a few 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.600
 ball pokémon and human beings 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.940
 Saraniti in mutual trust and yes 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.490
 they will help each other and this is the world 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.130
 that I want to see and see what goes away 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.479
 or girls we took zero but the first 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:21.710
 attempt maybe because type in white e 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:23.420
 black was captured much more easily 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.500
 all pokémon as if it were some 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.510
 in the limelight at the beginning and maybe it's for 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.480
 this bo however we have had anyway 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.730
 really ass if it's not for that though 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.360
 I'm glad they are extremely 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:44.690
 glad to have caught him a little 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:46.940
 see then the weaker then more 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.300
 defense less than special party 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.740
 let's go see some of his moves now 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.570
 clashed zen unbelieving from signs and 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.460
 exclusive all physical moves indeed the 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.490
 his attack his attack really is 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.410
 very high and nothing if you want it 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.960
 use it you can only use in the 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.730
 tia ruber because precisely it is a bit 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.120
 as a hub it is really strong no 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.430
 it would destroy everything you can use it with 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.620
 light torpedo type move that learns 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.880
 level 100 a more powerful version of 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:19.340
 crossover man however that can less precise 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.850
 let's say drag claws then you can put 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.440
 also earthquake and stone outrage 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.260
 cut if you can learn it otherwise 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.610
 choose you I used it can that 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:34.010
 I did a lot of it with a scarf stole 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.590
 the scarf that stuff the wide choice 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.000
 I think it's called and no boys 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.550
 thanks for the presentation, see you 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.150
 in the next videos where we will capture care 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.150
 Hi everyone
