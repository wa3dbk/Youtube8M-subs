00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
think I saw a lot in him that I'd you

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.860 
think I saw a lot in him that I'd you
know<00:03:57.500> wanna<00:03:57.799> see<00:03:58.190> myself<00:03:58.370> he<00:03:59.030> was<00:03:59.060> someone<00:03:59.480> you

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
know wanna see myself he was someone you

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.509 
know wanna see myself he was someone you
know<00:03:59.989> he<00:04:00.230> always<00:04:00.380> stood<00:04:00.769> up<00:04:00.860> for<00:04:00.920> his<00:04:01.130> team<00:04:01.340> and
