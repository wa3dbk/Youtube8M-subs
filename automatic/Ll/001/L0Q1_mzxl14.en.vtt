00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 spike again and today we continue our 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 Minecraft mods reviews and today 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.000
 us mod which will add a lot of new 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.460
 danzhe our favorite game and let's all 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.410
 we will definitely see them and we will start with 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.359
 also called regen 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 ziggurats will be remembered in the ordinary world and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 rarely enough until we can 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.560
 to meet him by the way only in the desert and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 let's see what it is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.240
 interesting useful and I immediately see 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.850
 golden blocks and i think it's nice they 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.520
 in my opinion from all four sides at once 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.430
 I will say that I did not look at it in advance 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.830
 that is , by the way the card is made 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.870
 mod developers to make it special 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.220
 see all the map you can download in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.340
 video description 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.660
 so let's take take take 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.940
 a little torch namely 1 and put 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 pretty good, I think a lot 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.050
 many emeralds and principle we can many 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.350
 to trade residents and this is very cool 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.990
 obsidian even eat well in principle first 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.180
 the temple left pretty good 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.540
 impressions well let's see what 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.520
 will be from others so come back up 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.170
 here by the way we have what's here 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 that here we still have gold cool and here 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.510
 we have a small balcony along the way 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 Yes, and we fly on and next with us 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:40.340
 Temple will let endermena it'll go 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.260
 and here we can meet ice and 2 eggs 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.290
 2 dragon eggs of course and go up 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.810
 upstairs and see here what we see here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.260
 portal to the edge but there we will not go oh 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.630
 okay and let's go further I think that here 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.960
 this building is quite useful and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.670
 principle not to look not to look 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.010
 what do they look for not looking for a fortress 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.680
 You can find just such a building and 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.480
 principle from it already jump the portal and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.730
 kill the poor dragon 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.420
 Well, here already someone killed him and we 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:15.120
 we see that here lies the poor dragon here 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.480
 I do not know who did not understand this skeleton 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 the dragon to the remains more precisely from him in 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.340
 Basically, I do not know 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.860
 who wants can unsubscribe in 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.810
 comments and basically nothing 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.280
 other than gold, we are not here 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.260
 find and move on we have a temple 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.080
 This topic is acting first visit and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.190
 here we have such 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.440
 the totem that we can find emeralds i 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.090
 I do not know the creators of fashion is very likely 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.560
 loved emeralds once scattered them 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.470
 almost all further yes this house 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.200
 this is his house in the sea because of something 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.150
 you won't find it just on this one 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.680
 map that is so simple not built 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.370
 you know what actually ask 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.320
 developer here with us 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.800
 I forgot to name how to say how 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.490
 called it further ok ok here u 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.380
 we have here what I see in principle 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.450
 principle quite such a rich dange and 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.510
 in my opinion called the Mexican temple yes 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.510
 here the blocks are behind the blocks of diamonds and I don't know 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.489
 No guys this is not a cheat I will immediately say 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.400
 because it is very rare 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.560
 meet it just go mikroft and 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.220
 run for five minutes and you don't 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.480
 meet or what i 'm assuring you 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.760
 Further we are here is such a house as well, 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.980
 away hell library let's say so 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.070
 here what we see here we see very 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.250
 many books I do not know in my book this 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.400
 very useful thing and principle further 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.560
 may well enrich you aisle 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.810
 upstairs i'm not there is a passage upstairs and 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.570
 Immediately have enchant and tincture too 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.970
 very useful well upstairs probably something 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.780
 will be like and think so there is something 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.230
 like a maze and I don't recognize something 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.459
 in general, so here that we have here 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.680
 Well, in general, two indra chests that they 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:17.900
 lies master okay i don't drive them and in 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.530
 In general , this library seems to be 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.030
 cool and by the way very useful 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.280
 next is the head of poor gastas well here 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.410
 I think you will find only useful 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.680
 iron and gold well it is not so 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.600
 not so small and in general you find 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.000
 you can this deck by the way and this 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.820
 library too only in hell 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.850
 the house goes from hell too 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.700
 such a house with built-in farms then 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.250
 I just don't know how this water is 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.590
 maybe in hell but still I assure you 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:59.120
 these buildings are generated only in hell 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:01.850
 and here and here with us here with us 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.620
 the same thing in general is the schedule you were and 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.150
 portal that is you can if you find 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.990
 such a building in hell quietly return 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.870
 home we go further this is our well 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 attached to this house and last 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.750
 probably the most interesting building and 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.600
 the rarest 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.370
 we have this here 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.810
 will meet too 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.000
 in hell nether crystal tempo meets 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.979
 here we are such ice and here many times 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.780
 stone you can pick on redstone 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.930
 here, of course, is not important because 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.910
 there are three golden rooms 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.100
 emerald and diamond well let's get started 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.640
 from the coolest it is of course diamond and 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.500
 we have a lot of diamonds here and 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:47.240
 accordingly there are diamond blocks well in 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.070
 send other rooms too 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.330
 I donâ€™t know in principle why because 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.770
 they are all like that here 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.660
 and 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.610
 its all principle is all the same that is 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.030
 there will be gold such gold 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.560
 little man I do not know and by the way here yet 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.069
 hellish warts as you might have noticed 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:08.639
 also quite a useful thing go further 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:11.500
 here we have emeralds what to say 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.569
 emerald room like room but 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.310
 for some reason it was made average as the most 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.620
 chief probably I don't know but in my 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.199
 diamonds like something like that better 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.530
 lizoblyudov diseases and 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.840
 and the battle is scheduled I am writing write to 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.199
 comments that prefer diamonds 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.240
 or 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:33.699
 emerald and well and in principle concessions I even 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.539
 amazing really the same no then 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.849
