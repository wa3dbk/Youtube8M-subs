really difficult off-road work so I'm

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.069 
really difficult off-road work so I'm
going<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.700> fit<00:00:25.090> it<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.240> my<00:00:25.450> vehicle<00:00:25.599> quickly<00:00:25.869> a

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
going to fit it to my vehicle quickly a

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.429 
going to fit it to my vehicle quickly a
couple<00:00:26.470> of<00:00:26.590> devices<00:00:27.300> that'll<00:00:28.300> help<00:00:28.509> me<00:00:28.810> cope

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 

it's<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.790> simple<00:01:18.939> as<00:01:19.210> just<00:01:19.420> selecting<00:01:19.870> the

moves sending pulsed information to the
receiver<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.460> all<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.760> do<00:01:42.940> let's<00:01:43.810> take<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:43.960> bit

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
receiver and all you do let's take a bit

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
receiver and all you do let's take a bit
of<00:01:44.200> velcro<00:01:44.320> on<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.650> dashboard<00:01:45.190> and<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of velcro on the dashboard and that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:01.120 
of velcro on the dashboard and that
simple<00:01:49.000> as<00:01:49.090> that

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.880 

we're<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.820> our<00:02:01.850> way<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.150> of<00:02:02.630> old<00:02:02.810> apartment<00:02:03.650> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
we're on our way to of old apartment a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.490 
we're on our way to of old apartment a
wild<00:02:04.580> horse<00:02:04.790> Ridge<00:02:05.240> Gregg<00:02:05.930> informs<00:02:06.350> me<00:02:06.470> that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
wild horse Ridge Gregg informs me that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.160 
wild horse Ridge Gregg informs me that
there<00:02:06.860> were<00:02:07.040> might<00:02:07.700> even<00:02:07.909> still<00:02:08.209> be<00:02:08.420> wild

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
there were might even still be wild

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:20.520 
there were might even still be wild
horses<00:02:09.590> they're<00:02:15.580> challenging<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.850> vehicle

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.490 

that<00:02:21.130> machine

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that machine

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
that machine
great<00:02:23.040> vehicle<00:02:23.580> obviously<00:02:24.390> far<00:02:24.630> more<00:02:24.660> capable

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
great vehicle obviously far more capable

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:34.550 
great vehicle obviously far more capable
off-road<00:02:29.900> yeah<00:02:30.900> it's<00:02:31.020> working<00:02:32.210> right<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
off-road yeah it's working right and of

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.350 
off-road yeah it's working right and of
course<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:34.980> go<00:02:35.250> off<00:02:35.400> blase<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.210> off

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
course you just go off blase just off

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.120 
course you just go off blase just off
you'll<00:02:36.570> go<00:02:36.690> up<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.960> hill<00:02:37.170> over<00:02:37.530> boulders<00:02:37.830> and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
you'll go up the hill over boulders and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.930 
you'll go up the hill over boulders and
everything<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.670> his<00:02:38.990> with<00:02:39.990> his<00:02:40.020> vehicle<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.210 

so<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:44.970> think<00:02:45.240> actually<00:02:46.020> I'm<00:02:46.440> anticipating<00:02:46.740> on

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
so I think actually I'm anticipating on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.130 
so I think actually I'm anticipating on
this<00:02:47.400> trip<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:48.000> are<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.570> pushing<00:02:48.930> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
this trip we are going to be pushing the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.950 
this trip we are going to be pushing the
Fortuna<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.830> its<00:02:50.040> absolute<00:02:50.360> off-road<00:02:51.360> limit

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
Fortuna to its absolute off-road limit
