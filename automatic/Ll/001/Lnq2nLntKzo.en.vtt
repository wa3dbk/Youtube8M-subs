00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
allows me just a block of a massive area

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.590 
allows me just a block of a massive area
of<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:40.550> center<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.880> map<00:02:42.120> which<00:02:42.420> is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
of the center of the map which is

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.180 
of the center of the map which is
basically<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:43.440> area<00:02:43.770> well<00:02:43.950> round

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
basically this just this area well round

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.240 
basically this just this area well round
now<00:02:44.780> if<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:46.110> do<00:02:46.170> don't<00:02:46.710> do<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> lot<00:02:46.950> over<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:49.250> lot

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
now if they do don't do a lot over a lot

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.360 
now if they do don't do a lot over a lot
of<00:02:50.340> well<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.180> don't<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.630> me<00:02:51.810> many<00:02:52.050> kills<00:02:52.370> for

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.310 
of well so don't get me many kills for
me<00:02:53.520> but<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.850> certainly<00:02:54.030> secures<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.050> area

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
me but it certainly secures the area

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.950 
me but it certainly secures the area
just<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.710> case<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.390> safe<00:02:57.630> place

the study hain so steady aim and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.770 
the study hain so steady aim and
sovereign<00:04:58.990> power<00:05:00.360> brilliant<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.449> think

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
sovereign power brilliant I think

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.969 
sovereign power brilliant I think
they're<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.020> only<00:05:02.169> ones<00:05:02.349> often<00:05:02.530> locked<00:05:02.740> so

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
they're the only ones often locked so

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.830 
they're the only ones often locked so
far<00:05:03.310> I'm<00:05:03.610> sure<00:05:03.939> there's<00:05:04.180> one<00:05:04.300> more<00:05:04.539> actually

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.810 
very early and right when the
leaderboards<00:06:51.710> preset<00:06:52.710> he<00:06:53.010> played<00:06:53.400> it<00:06:53.580> on

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
leaderboards preset he played it on

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.640 
leaderboards preset he played it on
stones<00:06:54.210> and<00:06:54.540> I<00:06:54.990> think<00:06:55.290> he's<00:06:55.410> named<00:06:55.620> X<00:06:55.890> CDD<00:06:56.760> and

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
stones and I think he's named X CDD and

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.080 
stones and I think he's named X CDD and
he<00:06:58.650> was<00:06:58.800> in<00:06:58.919> the<00:06:59.010> top<00:06:59.160> 200<00:06:59.400> he<00:06:59.760> was<00:06:59.850> hundred

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
he was in the top 200 he was hundred

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.700 
he was in the top 200 he was hundred
eighty<00:07:00.300> seven<00:07:00.630> when<00:07:00.750> I<00:07:00.870> saw<00:07:03.290> well<00:07:04.290> sometime

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
eighty seven when I saw well sometime

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.320 
eighty seven when I saw well sometime
last<00:07:04.890> night<00:07:05.040> and<00:07:05.310> then<00:07:05.400> he<00:07:05.490> messaged<00:07:05.820> everyone

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
last night and then he messaged everyone

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.690 
last night and then he messaged everyone
this<00:07:06.450> morning<00:07:06.690> saying<00:07:07.470> he'd<00:07:07.650> hit<00:07:07.830> level<00:07:08.040> 70

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
this morning saying he'd hit level 70

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.510 
this morning saying he'd hit level 70
the<00:07:08.910> jam<00:07:09.360> again<00:07:09.479> and<00:07:10.320> I<00:07:10.620> won't<00:07:10.770> spoil<00:07:11.160> it<00:07:11.190> for

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
the jam again and I won't spoil it for

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.880 
the jam again and I won't spoil it for
you<00:07:11.550> like<00:07:11.880> you<00:07:11.910> did<00:07:12.180> cross<00:07:12.479> what<00:07:13.320> you<00:07:13.440> guess<00:07:13.710> at

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
you like you did cross what you guess at

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.190 
you like you did cross what you guess at
level<00:07:14.250> 70<00:07:14.640> is<00:07:14.729> your<00:07:14.910> prestige<00:07:15.330> reward

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
level 70 is your prestige reward

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.020 
level 70 is your prestige reward
but<00:07:16.830> it's<00:07:16.980> certainly<00:07:17.190> not<00:07:17.460> something<00:07:17.520> you've

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
but it's certainly not something you've

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.300 
but it's certainly not something you've
seen<00:07:18.270> in<00:07:18.450> any<00:07:18.630> other<00:07:18.830> creative<00:07:19.830> class<00:07:19.950> video

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
seen in any other creative class video

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.410 
seen in any other creative class video
so<00:07:20.640> far<00:07:21.170> one<00:07:22.170> thing<00:07:22.320> goes<00:07:22.470> I<00:07:23.120> wasn't<00:07:24.120> impressed

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
so far one thing goes I wasn't impressed

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:31.160 
so far one thing goes I wasn't impressed
with<00:07:26.480> was<00:07:27.480> being<00:07:28.140> I<00:07:29.300> don't<00:07:30.300> know<00:07:30.360> the<00:07:30.930> fact

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.170 
with was being I don't know the fact

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.440 
with was being I don't know the fact
that<00:07:31.260> he<00:07:31.680> just<00:07:31.860> got<00:07:32.010> so<00:07:32.400> many<00:07:32.730> different

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.450 
that he just got so many different

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.670 
that he just got so many different
challenges<00:07:36.450> for<00:07:36.720> a<00:07:36.780> single<00:07:37.140> gun<00:07:37.290> and<00:07:37.470> you<00:07:37.530> have

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
challenges for a single gun and you have

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.940 
challenges for a single gun and you have
to<00:07:37.800> use<00:07:38.270> some<00:07:39.270> of<00:07:39.300> the<00:07:39.630> challenge<00:07:40.380> rewards<00:07:40.800> to

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:40.950 
to use some of the challenge rewards to

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.800 
to use some of the challenge rewards to

think<00:07:43.230> it<00:07:43.320> would<00:07:43.470> be<00:07:43.500> nice<00:07:43.710> to<00:07:43.890> be<00:07:43.920> able<00:07:44.070> to<00:07:44.310> aim

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.210 
think it would be nice to be able to aim
