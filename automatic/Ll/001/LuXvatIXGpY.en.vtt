00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.740
 rare 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.020
 on the other hand the intention 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.250
 and also noted that many drummers abuse eight 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.900
 made of the tarola 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.030
 because in the video you see 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.210
 of your favorite group is growing this year oaxaca no comet is closed because 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.120
 another thing is to watch a video recording actually play what you're 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.660
 doing 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.020
 let's use the intensity of the blow not knowing what not with what you have to the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.080
 of a deep and continuous attack qualifies 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.490
 in this case 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.290
 I've always seen that many drummers forget that they have pombo that does not 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.250
 they neglect because the mere 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250
 moment of being touching people 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.250
 pomicating pombo reality is a must is behind the coup must close the base 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.250
 so that your group is a rhythmic and solid pleasure 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.380
 we'll see 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 Venezuelan blow must be totally dry 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.940
 dry 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.110
 there is no need even sometimes to put cushions pillows because you can not 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.710
 use your same birthday 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.860
 with the pedal 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.220
 after the blow and leave completely a packet glued patch 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 so is this 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.690
 boland ed 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.300
 this kind of beats a very low tone if you're playing in a small place 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.110
 it does not hurt the viewer not carla no no it is not healthy you can even 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.100
 she told him the killer confidence in permanent with more accuracy 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.019
 and a deeper blow that benefits you 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.019
 here acting 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.299
 we do not know how the table the tarola that you have to take care of a lot is very 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.289
 important because in and of itself a take it 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.129
 in the tone to the is a very very fully measured and acute tone 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.469
 that we are going to take care of a nuance that we are going to do 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.639
 you do not have to use the volume not to which they accused the blow you are not to fall 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.669
 all the blow there is a control of nuances 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.909
 the nuance is totally 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.749
 much more I remove lower than the blow of the hype 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.289
 I watched 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.959
 there is no need for me to use so much volume the tarola to mediate the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.859
 drum 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.609
 with the tabala 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.979
 on the bottom to be what we observe a lot in the patricians 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.499
 It is very weak Otarola abuse denied it would have been tied 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:18.269
 but let's move on to the next 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 more than a step of setbacks setbacks in its 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.039
 Hurry in mind is 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:25.480
 a resource that is used 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.859
 to fill those constant times within music 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.870
 yes 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.870
 the setbacks you can be playing with them but in a way 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.349
 very very very 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.200
 accepted 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 who can give in like this by 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.719
 but do not make the mistake in touching all this 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.409
 songs 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.879
 pity is not good 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.809
 it removes fluency 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.719
 and it removes definition in what you do then thesis is that it does xuventude 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.229
 double format 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.769
 let's do 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.379
 a low blow mediation that I expose 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:12.009
 tell a year of setbacks 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.139
 trying to be 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.909
 that's it 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:17.900
 qualifying 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.900
 this precision 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:52.569
 I took you control 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.180
 much more more massive and heavier act 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.509
 that can bring you even more security 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.700
 both the bass player 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.180
 as your group 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.290
 and without hurting the viewer in volume abuse 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.279
 despot robla 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.159
 two setbacks
