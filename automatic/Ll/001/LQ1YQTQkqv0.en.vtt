00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello dear, here is Diane von Pollack 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.359
 is and I'll show you something today 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.990
 in recent times have taken to the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.490
 job 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.920
 I know one or the other thinks 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
 but always too little to join the team 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 They do not care so much 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.529
 because I have a lot of breakfast 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 and therefore not lunch with me 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.529
 quite as lush fails but the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.330
 dinner again 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 but I hope one or the other 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 inspiration may be there and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.890
 will definitely enjoy it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.480
 watch 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 I have again my tupperware of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.470
 Morning prepared very well with us now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.960
 late and you already see there 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 Tomorrow morning a glass or 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 salad with the day for bets in it 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.840
 the prawns just ready packaged 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.760
 You can of course also omit to buy 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.640
 or by other things like tofu 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.020
 replace the complete told her 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 See here now and blackmail a few 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.789
 because I fit you very well together 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.829
 Asian classes have the salad 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.750
 sauce made just like normal lemon 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.660
 a bit of soy sauce and yes if you are 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.489
 still want to give chillida 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 then I saw what I did 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.470
 a fridge has for vegetables 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.170
 Unfortunately, it was now back and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 a little bit of spring onions and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.650
 I think it will be cold tomorrow morning 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.240
 I'll have my morning lunch 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 time evening had me back my 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.310
 lunch prepared by tomorrow and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.930
 we had 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.810
 nice evening for dinner there have 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.490
 I see the rest of the rice you see 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 packed including a tupperware again 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.729
 that is so wild with normal now 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.020
 jasmin rice mixed and then there is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.299
 zuckerschoten with small 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.600
 Seared shrimp and a hack 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.280
 dark soy sauce and quite another 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.259
 but that will not be tomorrow 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 definitely healthy says make 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 We have dinner now 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.630
 homemade pizza made that is 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.000
 now mine and the league already has it 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.250
 There are around two camps on the pizza 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.829
 left camp it is now right 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.299
 I purposely made me no different and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.700
 I'll get that tomorrow with me and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.799
 you know, cold pizza almost tastes good 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.539
 as well as warm and I have now 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.180
 almost no cheese on it 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.790
 is acceptable and we still have it 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.260
 a few things on it and otherwise 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230
 actually only tomatoes and something 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.300
 Onions made the part on our own and we 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 originally only had wholegrain 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.959
 spelled flour but now you have to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.459
 we do that a bit normal mail because 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.349
 I just think that the dough otherwise 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.080
 To cookie-like is for my taste 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.849
 and so tastes best I think we 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.459
 had fried noodles tonight 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.629
 eat together and that's pretty 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.500
 much left over 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:44.550
 I just have to think that now 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.379
 there's tomorrow cold I have extra on it 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.569
 respected that still much liquid 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.989
 have made because otherwise the travelers 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.069
 rather not tomorrow 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.019
 and for those of you now 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.470
 ask yourself that and my broke 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.870
 jubilation 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 I've already done that again 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.159
 So right on the channel tilt 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.290
 There's more to me this morning 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.420
 simple what easy in me now 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.330
 sniping my tupperware together 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.370
 and that the carrots take it 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.870
 I just like sometimes so the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.819
 swell not small but rather 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.140
 they just become simple in between 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.810
 the whole carrot a bit 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.849
 snack and that is more grain bread 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 from our farmers next door 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.610
 and it's really delicious though 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.970
 one as grand as a big fan am 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.099
 and there you can see a bit on the left 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.989
 two more eggs from our sad 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.970
 Listen I'll be small now 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.950
 Snibble and then was with the book 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.269
 prove and then that is mine 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.700
 I lunch with him 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.010
 I've got something at least again 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.640
 prepared and that is easy now 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.270
 again rice with chicken was the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.400
 stepmother of my friend has from 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.200
 their thai meet still parts 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.360
 brought with you and it is so cute with 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.710
 curry and yes so that's all 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.190
 traditionally made part 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.230
 with spices and all sorts and that 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.600
 we want a piece of switzerland because of that 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.280
 I take now also exceptionally well 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.130
 times munich although I the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.300
 actually do not even need more 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.520
 that's not what matters anymore 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.720
 this week took writes 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.190
 me in the comments if you have it 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.900
 one or the other interesting 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.390
 and perhaps this is enough again 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.890
 a video like I do that as I do 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.940
 i prepared in any case 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.940
 behind kimi
