00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.690
 Here I am going to use the knitting needle. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.389
 I'm number four 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.310
 I'm also with an appropriate thread 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 for this proud numbering then 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.980
 here I have malan and on the label 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.619
 indication has been marking which number 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.419
 needle that you can use with the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.969
 movie in question 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:34.890
 here I have a wool a little bit more 

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:37.800
 thick that the club is that the woman then 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.380
 here the numbering that is suggested in the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.200
 label is 4 to 6 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.130
 I'm with needle 4 I'm with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.860
 the numbering that is basically correct 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.840
 but we can always do the work 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.270
 wired 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 as I will say by changing this 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.710
 numbering is not necessarily what 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.079
 it's there we should use 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 use more or less depends on the result 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 that we want to achieve 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.700
 so go there to have material and let's go 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.439
 begin to learn how to put the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.549
 stitches on the needle 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.619
 see only you will catch the tip of the wire 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.069
 and will leave some left over there that I 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.829
 I'm leaving leftovers well. 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.139
 this piece of you is going through 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.039
 these two fingers look looks at the station 

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:31.590
 that's where it's going to happen 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.529
 the rest of the thread the thread that is going 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 for the ball being pulled from the 

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:38.939
 brand new 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.689
 you will go over your thumb and 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.109
 back together with the base of the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.179
 The thread you passed there at the beginning 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:51.139
 keep these two wires safe with 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:56.039
 these two of them look at which station 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:57.539
 this is the format this is the wire position 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.770
 in the fingers 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:05.669
 already in the first step to arrange the thread 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.550
 this way since it is tidy 

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.300
 the wire and your fingers you will get the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.760
 your needle 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170
 the first point is what gives a little bit 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.610
 more work because you have to 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.439
 pinch it on the needle 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.780
 so it's so look you're going to move on 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.560
 needle underneath 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.870
 of the wire looks here between the big toe and the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.750
 indicator looks here is where the needle is 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.780
 You see, the top part does not have 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.959
 wire and here from below so I 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.590
 I step underneath your son, how are you? 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.930
 will rotate the needle so that it comes 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.110
 The front of the big toe looks like I'm 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.709
 on the dollar against the tip of the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.390
 needle inside this handle that you 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:55.110
 Did you hold the wire on your thumb? 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.239
 she 's in here again you go 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.209
 pull up an alcove here 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.950
 in this space between the indicator and the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.170
 Look, that's where the needle is. 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.170
 You'll pull a dance again. 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:16.250
 You 're doing 19 in the looks 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:20.239
 All right, go back inside the handle. 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.320
 passing again over the gift 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.820
 pull the thumbscrew out and adjust the thread 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:34.200
 on the needle 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:37.019
 looks only fitting for him fit and 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.650
 little if you complete alex and nezinho you 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.200
 here set the end of July and for 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.870
 continue yoy the position of the movie is 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.690
 same you have an ok now again 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.769
 you have on the handle of the turn on the big toe looks 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.880
 here you had done this step of the 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.760
 into the wire by pulling this handle 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.120
 passes the needle under the wire 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.730
 again 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.390
 remove the big toe handle and adjust the island only 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.700
 the handle on the thumb is made 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:16.620
 go under the wire 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.359
 pull the handle off your thumb and adjust one more 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:25.110
 time to the big toe is shrouded're the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.950
 needle inside this handle chile the wire 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.610
 of the thumb and fit and so you go 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.039
 inserting the stitches into your needle 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:40.699
 as many times as often 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.699
 needed to understand 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.689
 I hope to grow 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:49.229
 In case you do not understand, come back. 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.520
 movie watch again because it really is 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.360
 very easy 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.819
 Okay, so this is the first process and if 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.650
 put the stitches in the needle 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:02.599
 after that we can 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.599
 work our points
