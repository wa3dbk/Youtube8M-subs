00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
tabs pretty much in place here I have to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.560 
tabs pretty much in place here I have to
finish<00:00:40.469> welding<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> stuff<00:00:41.309> once<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.360> this

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.639 
finish welding and stuff once I got this
table<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:43.579> but<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.780> end<00:00:46.110> all

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
taped the bung to the tubing because

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
taped the bung to the tubing because
each<00:00:51.420> individual<00:00:52.110> tube<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.829> don't

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
each individual tube you know I don't

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.560 
each individual tube you know I don't
know<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.640> sure<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.270> length<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
know for sure if that's the length I

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.709 
know for sure if that's the length I
want<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.910> get<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> alignment<00:00:57.300> there

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
want I have to get the alignment there

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.049 
want I have to get the alignment there
on<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.020> whole<00:00:58.289> hub<00:00:58.859> assembly<00:00:59.309> once<00:00:59.820> that's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
on that whole hub assembly once that's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
on that whole hub assembly once that's
kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.539> shape<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
kind of in shape then you know and I

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
kind of in shape then you know and I
might<00:01:03.180> may<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> cut<00:01:03.840> individual<00:01:04.320> tubes

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
might may have to cut individual tubes

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
might may have to cut individual tubes
to<00:01:04.710> make<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.010> happen<00:01:05.129> yet<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:06.299> leaving

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
to make that happen yet so I'm leaving

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.859 
to make that happen yet so I'm leaving
that<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.869> now<00:01:07.520> so<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.299> side<00:01:09.570> here

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that for now so here at this side here

so<00:01:11.720> I've<00:01:12.720> got<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.500> brackets<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so I've got some brackets there that I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.410 
so I've got some brackets there that I
just<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.270> ready<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.810> attack<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.210> that<00:01:18.210> one

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
just are ready to attack on and that one

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
just are ready to attack on and that one
there<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> side<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
there is off to the side I just got a

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.210 
there is off to the side I just got a
hogtied<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> side<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.220> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hogtied off to the side there and that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.550 
hogtied off to the side there and that
one<00:01:23.340> could<00:01:23.490> sit<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> while<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:25.409> this

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
one could sit there for a while so this

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.670 
one could sit there for a while so this
is<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:25.920> working<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
is the one I'm working on right now and

is the one I'm working on right now and
I<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.799> those<00:01:29.070> tabs<00:01:29.340> looking<00:01:30.049> like<00:01:31.049> they're

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
I got those tabs looking like they're

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.850 
I got those tabs looking like they're
fitting<00:01:31.530> pretty<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.530> what<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.650> trying

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.539 
fitting pretty good so what I'm trying
to<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.869> get<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> gap<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> arms

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to do here is get the gap on the a arms

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
to do here is get the gap on the a arms
the<00:01:39.540> same<00:01:39.840> from<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.650> end<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:42.180> end<00:01:42.409> see

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the same from this end to that end see

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
the same from this end to that end see
this<00:01:43.590> end<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.920> can't<00:01:44.159> change<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.820> those

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
this end I can't change because those

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.569 
this end I can't change because those
melting<00:01:45.720> locations<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.829> kind<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.369> written

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
melting locations that's kind of written

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
melting locations that's kind of written
in<00:01:47.759> stone<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.240> unless<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.630> would<00:01:48.810> cut<00:01:49.020> up

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
in stone there unless I would cut up

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.730 
in stone there unless I would cut up
that<00:01:49.290> hub<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> reweld<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> modify<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.030> but

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
that hub and reweld it and modify it but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
that hub and reweld it and modify it but
for<00:01:52.740> now<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.070> it's<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.299> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
for now that's it's it's just the way it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
for now that's it's it's just the way it
is<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> distance<00:01:56.219> there

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
is that's the that's the distance there

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.600 
is that's the that's the distance there
so<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> did<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.619> took<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.009> measurement

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
so what I did is I took a measurement

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.069 
so what I did is I took a measurement
off<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:02.130> duplicated<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.329> with

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
off of that and I duplicated it with

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.160 
off of that and I duplicated it with
this<00:02:04.670> spacer<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.360> if<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.750> use<00:02:06.930> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this spacer here so if I if I use this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.619 
this spacer here so if I if I use this
level<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.160> piece<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.520> paper<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.060> this

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
level and this piece of paper and this

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.699 
level and this piece of paper and this
piece<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.050> tubing<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:12.470> piece<00:02:13.470> here

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
piece of tubing and then this piece here

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.180 
piece of tubing and then this piece here
is<00:02:13.830> just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
is just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
is just
just<00:02:14.400> sitting<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.000> spacer<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.760> then<00:02:17.760> I

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
just sitting on that spacer and then I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.370 
just sitting on that spacer and then I
put<00:02:18.510> also<00:02:18.840> put<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> level<00:02:20.450> between<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:22.350> and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
put also put a level between here and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.760 
put also put a level between here and
here<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.760> get<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:25.110> know<00:02:25.230> where<00:02:25.740> I

here just to get this you know where I

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.960 
here just to get this you know where I
wanted<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.280> way

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
wanted it that way

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.710 
wanted it that way
so<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.800> say<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.280> end<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.940> ready<00:02:30.630> to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
so like I say this end is just ready to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.980 
so like I say this end is just ready to
tack<00:02:31.020> on<00:02:31.200> there<00:02:31.440> now<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:32.270> then<00:02:33.270> next<00:02:33.870> I'm

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
tack on there now and then next I'm

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.410 
tack on there now and then next I'm
going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> move<00:02:34.230> over<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.530> there<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.090> once<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
of these all the AR m2 being all that
stuff<00:02:46.410> comes<00:02:46.980> off<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:48.030> going<00:02:48.120> to

also got a bit of a project that I want
to<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.770> Firebird<00:02:56.250> well<00:02:56.880> actually<00:02:57.030> got

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
to do on this Firebird well actually got

to do on this Firebird well actually got
lots<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.570> stuff<00:02:57.750> want<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.050> do<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.860> one

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
little one in particular it's been kind

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.990 
little one in particular it's been kind
of<00:03:01.710> in<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.040> back<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.460> my<00:03:02.520> mind<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.970> long

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
of in the back of my mind for a long

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.110 
of in the back of my mind for a long
time<00:03:03.330> but<00:03:03.540> nothing<00:03:04.020> ever<00:03:04.260> happens<00:03:04.680> because

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
time but nothing ever happens because

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.400 
time but nothing ever happens because
well<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.630> kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.290> those

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
well it's kind of like one of those

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.740 
well it's kind of like one of those
things<00:03:07.650> where<00:03:07.830> it's<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.330> puzzle

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
things where it's it's a bit of a puzzle

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.210 
things where it's it's a bit of a puzzle
and<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.960> just<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.500> know<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.620> just<00:03:10.710> haven't<00:03:11.130> got

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and you just you know I just haven't got

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.320 
and you just you know I just haven't got
it<00:03:11.340> solved<00:03:11.970> yet

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
it solved yet

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.420 
it solved yet
but<00:03:12.960> I<00:03:12.990> think<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.040> want<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.280> do

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
but I think I know now what I want to do

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.900 
but I think I know now what I want to do
and<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:15.990> case<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.860> problem<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
and in this case the problem is is the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.570 
and in this case the problem is is the
way<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.209> door<00:03:18.420> fits<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.020> if<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.860> see<00:03:20.220> how

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
way that door fits and if you see how

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.120 
way that door fits and if you see how
the<00:03:20.640> door<00:03:21.060> actually<00:03:21.360> extends<00:03:21.989> away<00:03:22.800> from<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
the door actually extends away from the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.660 
the door actually extends away from the
body<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.320> bottom<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.250> actually

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
body and but the bottom it actually

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.120 
body and but the bottom it actually
sucks<00:03:27.000> into<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.510> body<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.860> door<00:03:29.100> is

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
sucks into the body so that the door is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.820 
sucks into the body so that the door is
a<00:03:29.280> little<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.790> little<00:03:30.000> cockeyed<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.900> so

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
a little a little cockeyed like that so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.710 
a little a little cockeyed like that so
well<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.340> would<00:03:32.459> seem<00:03:32.640> like<00:03:32.820> no<00:03:33.180> big<00:03:33.209> deal<00:03:33.540> you

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
well it would seem like no big deal you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.690 
well it would seem like no big deal you
loosen<00:03:34.020> off<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> hinges<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.830> just<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.580> some

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
loosen off the hinges and just get some

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.910 
loosen off the hinges and just get some
adjusting<00:03:36.180> done<00:03:36.330> but<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:39.770> hinges<00:03:40.770> are

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
adjusting done but so the hinges are

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.370 
adjusting done but so the hinges are
actually<00:03:41.540> they<00:03:42.540> sit<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.900> little<00:03:43.200> pin

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
actually they sit on this little pin

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.560 
actually they sit on this little pin
here<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.459> need<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.060> loosen<00:03:45.269> off

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
here so what I need to do is loosen off

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.949 
here so what I need to do is loosen off
these<00:03:45.900> bolts<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> could<00:03:48.030> make<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
these bolts so that I could make the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.110 
these bolts so that I could make the
adjustment<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:50.040> there's<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.340> nut<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.940> back

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
adjustment but there's a nut on the back

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.390 
adjustment but there's a nut on the back
side<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.450> spins<00:03:52.019> so<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.380> can't<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.950> can't

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
side that spins so I can't I can't

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.660 
side that spins so I can't I can't
really<00:03:53.670> properly<00:03:54.090> loosen<00:03:54.989> them<00:03:55.080> off<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.670> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
really properly loosen them off so to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.990 
really properly loosen them off so to
make<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.000> happen

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
make this happen

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.530 
make this happen
so<00:04:00.000> here's<00:04:00.209> where<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.450> puzzle<00:04:00.870> comes<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:03.390> make

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
so here's where the puzzle comes to make

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.440 
so here's where the puzzle comes to make
that<00:04:03.750> happen<00:04:04.550> see<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.640> have<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.000> remove<00:04:06.239> this

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
that happen see I have to remove this

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.530 
that happen see I have to remove this
door<00:04:06.750> panel<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.400> it's<00:04:08.400> very<00:04:08.700> well<00:04:08.910> made<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.450> I

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
door panel and it's very well made and I

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.850 
door panel and it's very well made and I
don't<00:04:09.600> want<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.930> bugger<00:04:10.140> up<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.410> paint<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
don't want to bugger up the paint and

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.800 
don't want to bugger up the paint and
you<00:04:11.820> see<00:04:12.209> it's<00:04:12.600> held<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:12.959> with<00:04:13.170> rivets<00:04:13.769> so<00:04:14.810> no

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you see it's held on with rivets so no

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.270 
you see it's held on with rivets so no
big<00:04:15.989> deal<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.200> just<00:04:16.440> drill<00:04:16.709> out<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.980> rivets

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
big deal you just drill out the rivets

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.300 
big deal you just drill out the rivets
and<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:17.640> how<00:04:18.299> about<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.690> but<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.560> don't<00:04:20.070> want

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
and then how about it but I don't want

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.940 
and then how about it but I don't want
to<00:04:20.370> scratch<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.910> paint<00:04:20.959> see<00:04:21.959> there<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:22.919> a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
to scratch the paint see there is a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.520 
to scratch the paint see there is a
they've<00:04:23.910> never<00:04:24.120> been<00:04:24.300> off<00:04:24.450> before<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.050> if<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.260> I

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
they've never been off before and if I I

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.020 
they've never been off before and if I I
know<00:04:25.860> what<00:04:26.070> happens<00:04:26.400> when<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.640> drill<00:04:26.850> out<00:04:27.000> a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
know what happens when you drill out a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.500 
know what happens when you drill out a
rivet

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
rivet

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.420 
rivet
you're<00:04:27.930> you're<00:04:28.410> almost<00:04:28.620> finished<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.340> then

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
you're you're almost finished and then

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.780 
you're you're almost finished and then
it<00:04:29.550> starts<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.910> spin<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.920> so<00:04:31.920> what<00:04:32.580> I'm<00:04:32.670> going

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
it starts to spin and so what I'm going

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
it starts to spin and so what I'm going
to<00:04:32.820> do<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.060> I'm<00:04:33.180> going<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.330> end<00:04:33.450> up<00:04:33.570> damaging

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
to do is I'm going to end up damaging

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.530 
to do is I'm going to end up damaging
the<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.560> paint<00:04:34.800> as<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.040> spins<00:04:35.430> as<00:04:35.700> I<00:04:35.730> finish

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
the the paint as it spins as I finish

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.960 
the the paint as it spins as I finish
off<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.740> know<00:04:37.830> drilling<00:04:38.250> those<00:04:38.370> rivets

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
off that you know drilling those rivets

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.790 
off that you know drilling those rivets
out<00:04:39.120> so<00:04:39.720> that's<00:04:40.410> the<00:04:40.800> puzzle<00:04:41.300> too<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.320> think

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
out so that's the puzzle too so I think

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.330 
out so that's the puzzle too so I think
I've<00:04:44.610> got<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.880> plan<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.420> make<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.840> little<00:04:46.170> tool<00:04:46.380> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
I've got a plan to make a little tool to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.510 
I've got a plan to make a little tool to
hold<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.270> rivet<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:48.810> place<00:04:49.080> while<00:04:49.920> I<00:04:49.980> drill

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
hold that rivet in place while I drill

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.020 
hold that rivet in place while I drill
it<00:04:50.640> out<00:04:50.730> so<00:04:50.940> that<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.150> can't<00:04:51.360> spin<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:52.050> that's

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
it out so that it can't spin so that's

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.180 
it out so that it can't spin so that's
that's<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.330> that's<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.320> little<00:04:55.560> puzzle<00:04:55.920> so

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
that's the that's the little puzzle so

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.590 
that's the that's the little puzzle so
it's<00:04:56.370> kind<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.640> always<00:04:56.790> been<00:04:56.880> bugging<00:04:57.360> me<00:04:57.390> and

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
it's kind of always been bugging me and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.040 
it's kind of always been bugging me and
I<00:04:57.630> want<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.900> fix<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.980> but<00:04:59.880> well<00:05:00.840> that's

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
I want to fix that and but well that's

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.440 
I want to fix that and but well that's
going<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.590> be<00:05:01.680> on<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.490> list<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:03.000> things<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.360> do

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
going to be on the list of things to do

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.610 
going to be on the list of things to do
yet<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.670> it's<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.880> CV<00:05:06.240> angles<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.260> I<00:05:07.320> have

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
yet so it's the CV angles that I have

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.910 
yet so it's the CV angles that I have
back<00:05:08.190> here<00:05:08.520> that's<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.600> major<00:05:10.050> factor<00:05:10.470> in<00:05:10.710> how

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
back here that's a major factor in how

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.480 
back here that's a major factor in how
much<00:05:11.130> travel<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.670> can<00:05:11.820> get<00:05:11.940> out<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.240> so<00:05:13.490> it

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
much travel I can get out of it so it

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.740 
much travel I can get out of it so it
looks<00:05:14.700> like<00:05:14.880> I'm<00:05:15.000> going<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.180> be<00:05:15.300> able<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.510> pull

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
looks like I'm going to be able to pull

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.510 
looks like I'm going to be able to pull
off<00:05:15.930> all<00:05:16.230> of<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.440> suspension<00:05:16.980> travel<00:05:17.220> that<00:05:17.490> I

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
off all of the suspension travel that I

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.700 
off all of the suspension travel that I
wanted<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:17.970> originally<00:05:18.570> so<00:05:18.870> if<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.320> guys<00:05:19.470> have

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
wanted to originally so if you guys have

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
what that number is

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.040 
what that number is
and<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:24.270> it's<00:05:24.600> gonna<00:05:24.750> be<00:05:24.930> big<00:05:25.700> so<00:05:26.700> then<00:05:27.060> yeah

end once they get this kind of wrapped
up<00:05:32.070> in<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.280> back<00:05:32.430> here<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:34.790> yeah<00:05:35.790> well<00:05:36.120> I
