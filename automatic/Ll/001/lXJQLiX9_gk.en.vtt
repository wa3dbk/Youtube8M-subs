00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.220
 and we are already with marta that almost 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.380
 love really was in the expo the 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.800
 mamushkas but also that the tomato as 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.800
 we call you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.759
 matrioskas mamushkas that we also want 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:29.529
 a style 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:31.359
 to us that yes good as everything now 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.480
 that is used a little changing the colors 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.780
 and what really are spectacular 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.410
 they love all the details of the paper the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.329
 paint the buttons or the faces that 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.000
 they are enlisted amaro la carita está 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.100
 painted and all the edge and the whole goal 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.070
 we paste this with the paper so it's a 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.809
 easy technique to become fast and remains 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.789
 very showy and it is very showy 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.039
 so good so let's work and 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.199
 work the way is very simple I the 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.350
 cut with cala d'or in thick fibrofácil 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.629
 of the thickness they want and that way 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.070
 what they are going to do is mark themselves as a 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.690
 mold cited to separate nothing else 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.030
 parts of the head this 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.120
 and the base if these are the parts that 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.740
 let's cut later on paper 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.360
 and we will check if we're going to do in 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
 serious let's do a little group what 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.640
 we mark with that in this sector that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.980
 the only thing that we are going to 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.040
 to do is give a relief if you look today 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:35.530
 came out and so we do like this later what 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.110
 we arrange we make a few dots and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.870
 we make as if it were a this one 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.660
 as a point particle is the only thing that 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.330
 it goes in relief we're going to let it dry and 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.190
 I'm going to another little step where 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.400
 I have 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.750
 this dry so I can work comfortably 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.460
 I left a base here because later I'm going 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.130
 to show in this step where they have to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.580
 paint the face and then it's all paper 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.830
 all the time front I cut what 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.600
 I showed them new and the back 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 that the only thing that varies is that we 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.790
 We put the little window in the face all that 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.010
 to be seen on the cover where 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.770
 only the door and they are equal front and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.830
 back we snuggle the back handkerchief 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.480
 and in the handkerchief of the back 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 we do it straight instead of doing it 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.820
 I tie nothing more so that people are 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.500
 at full age only then 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.390
 all these lines that I marked for 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 that will help me to continue the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.840
 in the side and what we're going to do that 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.290
 here is important because they are going to do 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.130
 paint details is with the color that 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.840
 I chose if in this case it is the front what 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.550
 what I'm going to do is paint up that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.290
 line with the same color 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.209
 we have to go trying to find 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.370
 acrylic colors or preparing those of 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.660
 a blue sky that gave me perfect with 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.970
 paper 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.140
 if we do not build it if in the case of 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.450
 yellow mix for the part of the paper 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.510
 lemon and white yellow print 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.180
 then they are painting each sector because 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.640
 of course it will continue the contour 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.790
 of the paper then simply all the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.250
 front I'm going to do just in this 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.880
 case glue the papers with gold glue 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.430
 to the water if we are going to use different 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.310
 materials to paste then a layer 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.590
 finita are going to let her breathe a little bit and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.870
 we are of course to assemble as if 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.690
 a puzzle each of the parties 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.360
 instead you start composing already 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.100
 I'm going to a more advanced step is very 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.030
 good that the dollar is going to be composed 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.090
 we are here then the only thing that I hit 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.310
 this in the union of this guard is a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.410
 Self-adhesive storage is very easy to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.650
 Paste is the only one that you use as 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.090
 self-adhesive to give 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.000
 as a termination after they have to 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.920
 continue all the color we paint and 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.110
 paint that guard keep it in mind 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.180
 also then what we have to 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.459
 to do in the contours is to continue 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.760
 I just grabbed any more brush 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.220
 small but you will see it in the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.030
 Largest doll of the big and the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.949
 idea to imitate the best we can 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.150
 continue the design is all that outline 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.250
 it's painted, we look for the colors and 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.010
 we continue see the whole outline with 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.510
 little sheets and I'll show you the last 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.520
 detail nothing more than just the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.130
 I show as in a step by step so that 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.050
 have an idea of ​​what the basis of the 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.940
 face that is very simple if they are colors 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.280
 plans and then we work with the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.729
 classics floats data and details always 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.370
 with a finite brush at the end if it stops 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.220
 do the details of the hack and give it 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.960
 a little bit of enhancement there is good as 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.210
 they are a carrier since we have 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.900
 to go but know that all will 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 upload to the web 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.740
