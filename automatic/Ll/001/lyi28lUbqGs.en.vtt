I<00:03:42.480> think<00:03:43.480> power-steering<00:03:44.140> would<00:03:44.440> be<00:03:44.560> the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
I think power-steering would be the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.010 
I think power-steering would be the
ultimate<00:03:45.250> upgrade<00:03:45.370> on<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> razor<00:03:46.060> s<00:03:46.360> no<00:03:46.870> it's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
ultimate upgrade on the razor s no it's

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.110 
ultimate upgrade on the razor s no it's
not<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.410> S<00:03:47.560> has<00:03:47.920> any<00:03:48.100> handling<00:03:48.640> issues

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
not that the S has any handling issues

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120 
not that the S has any handling issues
and<00:03:49.330> needs<00:03:49.569> power<00:03:49.900> steering<00:03:50.350> it's<00:03:50.830> just<00:03:51.010> that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
and needs power steering it's just that

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.790 
and needs power steering it's just that
it<00:03:51.190> would<00:03:51.280> make<00:03:51.430> steering<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:51.970> much<00:03:52.209> easier

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
it would make steering that much easier

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.940 
it would make steering that much easier
basically<00:03:53.800> I<00:03:53.980> just<00:03:54.640> want<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:54.940> all<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.950> that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
and it's not really something that's

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
like I shouldn't have to say this but

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.910 
like I shouldn't have to say this but
I'm<00:04:12.970> going<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.360> anyway<00:04:13.540> because<00:04:14.080> Polaris<00:04:14.739> is
