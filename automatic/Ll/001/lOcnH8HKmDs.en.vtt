to make it a darker color so we can see

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.899 
to make it a darker color so we can see
it<00:01:48.770> I'm<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> bigger<00:01:50.610> base

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it I'm going to make a bigger base

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.639 
it I'm going to make a bigger base
scaling<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.470> going

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
scaling it not that because it's going

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.819 
scaling it not that because it's going
to<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.860> moving<00:01:53.070> around<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.710> what

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
to be moving around so then that's what

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.380 
to be moving around so then that's what
you<00:01:55.890> wanna<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.759> three<00:01:56.969> options

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you wanna do then you have three options

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.560 
you wanna do then you have three options
here<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.229> video<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.579> FX<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.390> then

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
here you have the video of FX and then

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.490 
here you have the video of FX and then
the<00:02:00.840> pen<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> crop<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.299> generating<00:02:03.299> media<00:02:04.020> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the pen and crop and generating media so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.660 
the pen and crop and generating media so
you<00:02:04.590> want<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> go<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> pen<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.490> crop

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you want to go on to the pen and crop

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.960 
you want to go on to the pen and crop
and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.259> will<00:02:07.469> pop<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.489> which<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and then this will pop up so which one I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.570 
and then this will pop up so which one I
focus<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.379> at<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> bottom<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.400> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
focus on is here at the bottom this is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.360 
focus on is here at the bottom this is
what<00:02:11.760> are<00:02:11.879> called<00:02:12.120> keyframes

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
what are called keyframes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.490 
what are called keyframes
so<00:02:13.610> I'm<00:02:14.090> going<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.480> try<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:14.900> explain<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.230> as

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
so I'm going to try and explain this as

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.380 
so I'm going to try and explain this as
much<00:02:15.830> as<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.340> possibly<00:02:16.879> can<00:02:17.830> okay<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.360> to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
much as I possibly can okay so I like to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.089 
much as I possibly can okay so I like to
just<00:02:20.690> kind<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:20.959> fit<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.290> together<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> have

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
just kind of fit it together so I have

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.100 
just kind of fit it together so I have
this<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.730> then<00:02:22.819> I<00:02:22.879> have<00:02:23.150> my<00:02:23.360> actual<00:02:23.540> video<00:02:24.050> of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
this and then I have my actual video of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.680 
this and then I have my actual video of
how<00:02:24.500> I<00:02:24.530> can<00:02:24.830> check<00:02:25.069> how<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.569> going<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.920> um

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
how I can check how it is going so um

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.479 
how I can check how it is going so um
this<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.900> usually<00:02:30.170> how<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.530> move<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.310> how<00:02:31.459> I

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
this is usually how I move like how I

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.089 
this is usually how I move like how I
animate<00:02:32.120> my<00:02:32.390> text<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:32.930> basically<00:02:33.410> would<00:02:33.680> start

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
animate my text so basically would start

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.440 
animate my text so basically would start
off<00:02:34.250> with<00:02:34.549> is<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.910> want<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.090> make<00:02:35.209> sure<00:02:35.360> that

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
off with is you want to make sure that

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.869 
off with is you want to make sure that
you<00:02:35.660> are<00:02:35.840> at<00:02:36.049> one<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:37.250> want<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.489> start<00:02:37.730> off

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
you are at one and you want to start off

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.720 
you are at one and you want to start off
this<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.690> how<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.870> do<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.110> started<00:02:39.680> off<00:02:39.830> by<00:02:40.069> going

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
this is how I do I started off by going

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.970 
this is how I do I started off by going
off<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.269> screen<00:02:41.540> then<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.170> go<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.560> like<00:02:42.950> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
off of the screen then I go to like a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.539 
off of the screen then I go to like a
little<00:02:43.340> point<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.500> let's<00:02:45.709> move<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.040> there

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
little point so let's move that there

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.490 
little point so let's move that there
you<00:02:47.000> move<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.299> cursor<00:02:47.450> there<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.110> then<00:02:48.260> I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
you move the cursor there and then I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.130 
you move the cursor there and then I
just<00:02:48.790> make<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.819> go<00:02:50.239> back<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.750> middle<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.079> I

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
just make a go back in the middle so I

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.630 
just make a go back in the middle so I
click<00:02:51.349> restore<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.099> like<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.489> middle

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
click restore so it's like in the middle

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.140 
click restore so it's like in the middle
and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.510> move<00:02:53.780> one<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.410> then<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:56.060> of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
and then I move one and then I kind of

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.750 
and then I move one and then I kind of
like<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.540> make<00:02:57.200> like<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.410> shake<00:02:57.799> effect<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.459> and

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
like to make like a shake effect and and

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.839 
like to make like a shake effect and and
rotate<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.690> then<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.930> move<00:03:00.170> one<00:03:00.610> again<00:03:01.610> and

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
rotate it and then I move one again and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.319 
rotate it and then I move one again and
then<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.720> rotate<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.290> again<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:05.030> moved

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
then I rotate it again and then I moved

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.420 
then I rotate it again and then I moved
to<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.840> another<00:03:06.140> point<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.450> then<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:09.430> go

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
to a little another point and then I go

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.569 
to a little another point and then I go
and<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.480> restore<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.110> again<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.920> then<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.340> go<00:03:13.549> to

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
and I restore it again and then I go to

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.690 
and I restore it again and then I go to
another<00:03:13.910> point<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.590> then<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:15.950> move<00:03:16.310> it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
another point and then I just move it

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.979 
another point and then I just move it
out<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.329> the<00:03:17.480> frame<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.519> since<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.670> skipped<00:03:20.120> like

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
out of the frame so since I skipped like

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.420 
out of the frame so since I skipped like
I<00:03:21.260> can't<00:03:21.530> really<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.889> don't<00:03:22.069> really<00:03:22.250> know<00:03:22.400> if

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
I can't really I don't really know if

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.340 
I can't really I don't really know if
you<00:03:22.519> guys<00:03:22.579> can<00:03:22.760> see<00:03:22.940> as<00:03:23.060> well<00:03:23.239> but<00:03:23.420> let<00:03:24.139> me<00:03:24.200> open

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
you guys can see as well but let me open

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.199 
you guys can see as well but let me open
this<00:03:24.709> bigger<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.639> have<00:03:26.030> these<00:03:26.150> little

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
this bigger so you have these little

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.050 
this bigger so you have these little
points<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.709> if<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.489> move<00:03:28.670> them<00:03:28.880> all

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
points here and if you move them all

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.759 
points here and if you move them all
closer<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.510> make<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.810> faster<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:30.440> you<00:03:30.560> move

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
closer I make it faster and if you move

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.559 
closer I make it faster and if you move
them<00:03:31.010> more<00:03:31.400> distance<00:03:31.819> from<00:03:31.880> each<00:03:32.060> other<00:03:32.209> it'll

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
them more distance from each other it'll

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.199 
them more distance from each other it'll
make<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> lot<00:03:33.079> a<00:03:33.290> lot<00:03:33.500> slower<00:03:33.799> so<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.370> kind<00:03:35.150> of

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
make it a lot a lot slower so I kind of

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.479 
make it a lot a lot slower so I kind of
like<00:03:35.480> my<00:03:35.750> text<00:03:36.079> going<00:03:36.319> fast<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.010> let's<00:03:37.250> see<00:03:37.400> if

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
like my text going fast so let's see if

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.240 
like my text going fast so let's see if
this<00:03:37.730> is<00:03:37.970> fast<00:03:38.239> this<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:39.200> very<00:03:39.410> slow<00:03:39.680> for<00:03:39.709> me<00:03:40.130> as

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
this is fast this is very slow for me as

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.710 
this is fast this is very slow for me as
you<00:03:40.370> can<00:03:40.519> tell<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:40.700> what<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:41.359> might<00:03:41.480> want<00:03:41.690> to

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
you can tell so what you might want to

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.890 
you can tell so what you might want to
do<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.230> might<00:03:42.560> want<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.859> have<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.900> put

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
do is you just might want to have to put

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.740 
do is you just might want to have to put
them<00:03:45.049> all<00:03:45.290> together<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:46.220> close<00:03:46.669> put<00:03:47.630> them

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
them all together just close put them

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.069 
them all together just close put them
all<00:03:47.930> close<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.410> each<00:03:48.500> other<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.720> they<00:03:50.720> kind<00:03:50.989> of

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
all close to each other so they kind of

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.759 
all close to each other so they kind of
all<00:03:51.319> go<00:03:51.530> smoothly<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.250> faster<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:54.410> know

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
all go smoothly and faster so you know

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.620 
all go smoothly and faster so you know
you<00:03:54.829> can<00:03:55.069> play<00:03:55.250> around<00:03:55.370> with<00:03:55.549> this<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.060> move

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
you can play around with this and move

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.479 
you can play around with this and move
the<00:03:56.780> keyframes<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.980> make<00:03:58.160> sure<00:03:58.310> they're<00:03:58.459> in

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
the keyframes just make sure they're in

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.759 
the keyframes just make sure they're in
order<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:59.060> how<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.269> move<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.720> text<00:04:00.109> so<00:04:00.680> you

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
order of how you move the text so you

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.370 
order of how you move the text so you
can<00:04:00.859> just<00:04:01.099> move<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.459> keyframes<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.200> make<00:04:03.200> it

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
can just move the keyframes to make it

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.770 
can just move the keyframes to make it
slower<00:04:03.650> faster<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:05.180> as<00:04:05.239> you<00:04:05.329> can<00:04:05.450> tell<00:04:05.660> that

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
slower faster so as you can tell that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.659 
slower faster so as you can tell that
was<00:04:05.989> way<00:04:06.319> too<00:04:06.349> fast<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.010> I'm<00:04:07.099> gonna<00:04:07.280> go<00:04:07.459> back

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
was way too fast so I'm gonna go back

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.360 
was way too fast so I'm gonna go back
and<00:04:07.700> do<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.419> I'm<00:04:09.169> going<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.650> move<00:04:09.859> this<00:04:10.160> all

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
and do is I'm going to move this all

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.960 
and do is I'm going to move this all
over<00:04:10.669> here<00:04:11.030> just<00:04:11.690> for<00:04:11.900> now<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:12.319> I<00:04:12.380> can<00:04:12.970> adjust

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
over here just for now so I can adjust

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.879 
over here just for now so I can adjust
it<00:04:14.209> so<00:04:14.450> what<00:04:15.049> I'm<00:04:15.139> going<00:04:15.349> to<00:04:15.410> do<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.709> I'm<00:04:15.859> going

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
it so what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.920 
it so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:04:16.160> move<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.639> over<00:04:17.389> here<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.630> this<00:04:17.870> little

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
to move it over here to this little

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.870 
to move it over here to this little
point<00:04:18.410> I'm<00:04:19.010> going<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.370> move<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:19.639> one<00:04:19.820> here

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
point I'm going to move this one here

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.050 
point I'm going to move this one here
move<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.440> point<00:04:21.979> just<00:04:22.430> move<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.909> to

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
move it to a point just move it to

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.180 
move it to a point just move it to
whatever<00:04:23.210> point<00:04:23.659> I<00:04:23.840> see

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
whatever point I see

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.770 
whatever point I see
okay<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.640> now<00:04:26.880> let's<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.240> check<00:04:27.660> it<00:04:27.720> out<00:04:27.900> now

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
okay and now let's just check it out now

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.180 
okay and now let's just check it out now
okay<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:31.170> is<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.320> lot<00:04:31.710> better<00:04:31.950> than<00:04:32.070> that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
okay so that is a lot better than that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.210 
okay so that is a lot better than that
is<00:04:32.460> how<00:04:32.670> I<00:04:32.700> would<00:04:33.090> move<00:04:33.270> my<00:04:33.330> text<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.050> yeah<00:04:34.830> you

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
is how I would move my text and yeah you

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.670 
is how I would move my text and yeah you
can<00:04:35.340> also<00:04:35.520> do<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:35.850> with<00:04:35.940> overlays<00:04:36.600> or<00:04:36.900> emojis
