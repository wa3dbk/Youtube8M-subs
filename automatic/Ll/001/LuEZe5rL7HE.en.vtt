00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.540
 The motorcyclists are looking today 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.780
 more and more demanding differentiated performance of their mother or tire 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:13.729
 Naturally 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:16.990
 all this on a test she high level here 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.190
 the general 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.890
 Percent performance of the product 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.110
 For example, what do you think about the daycare center? 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.259
 compared to the big ride 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.339
 straight ahead 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:30.890
 a tire is desired 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 Dr long life brings 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.390
 while in the short drive 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
 the liability is in the foreground 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.490
 Conflict of life and liability 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.440
 one has 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.690
 already for several years with different mixtures 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.030
 in the middle of the tread for straight ahead and on the shoulder of the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.240
 Tread for cornering 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.910
 Dr developed 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.420
 But Metzler is breaking new ground 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.560
 gone in this the former optimization 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.820
 during one 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.260
 research project 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.490
 turned out 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.190
 that is possible 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.210
 due to different tensions of the bobbin windings 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 to influence the performance of the tire 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.150
 maybe I should 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.770
 short on the going on the construction of a tire a tire is yes 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.820
 not only from the private sector or even tread compound but a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.050
 Tire also consists of one that belongs to the element that is under the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.440
 Tread is located in our case are there are circumferential direction 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.570
 Percent applied steel percent turns steel cables 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.670
 and under this belt is the carcass 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.810
 Now if you get the material or rigidity of the Kaka Shell or that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.940
 changes us 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.179
 influence with it the whole complex 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.899
 Percent currently has and therefore the performances meeting 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 by the odds tensions 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.500
 So the zero degree line succeeded 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.240
 on the one hand improve the adhesion in Turku 5 watts 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.459
 by reducing the preload 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.849
 without having to neglect the service life at the same time 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.840
 Dulig he 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.019
 Increase the tension in the with 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.469
 Metzler calls this concept interactive 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.999
 in the AK 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.140
 because we have the interaction of the carcass 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.140
 have the cult and the tread 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.619
 For the first time we applied this concept to our sport touring 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.269
 grab 6 6 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.360
 we have there 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.590
 the body tension in the middle chosen to be high for the lifetime 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.299
 support 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.650
 low on the shoulder to aid adhesion 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.510
 Of course, the transition goes from the middle to the shoulder 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.270
 harmonious because we trace of color driveways 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.270
 each can reduce the bias 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.079
 that has a big advantage over it 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:10.839
 more mix Scott z one uses two blends is always a transition of 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.749
 to determine the Alb first on the second mix 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:18.309
 one can also use mixtures one always has the transition of the 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.329
 one to the next Mischa 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.940
 that's how far we have from our concept one in the advantage of homogeneous 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.809
 Adaptation 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:33.749
 to understand the concepts this tool will be developed 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.379
 one can 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.869
 the strains 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.840
 The circulation will be simulated in the country 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.180
 practically the bias here increases as the tension of guitar strings 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.530
 and in the tool 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.840
 Ing is completely looking like they have we too 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.110
 Tread compound above it and can by the bias of the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.790
 girdle 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.509
 are you feeling 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.569
 she feels the whole complex is stiff 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.450
 and thus 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.529
 on the one hand 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:07.180
 which is supported by performance and enrichment with tension 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.639
 more the liability 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.159
 AR is in the foreground
