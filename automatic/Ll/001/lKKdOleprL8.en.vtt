00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
completely new I don't think it's been

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.700 
completely new I don't think it's been
used<00:01:51.659> before<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:54.030> can't<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.630> 100%<00:01:54.750> sure<00:01:55.320> but

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
used before I can't be 100% sure but

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
used before I can't be 100% sure but
either<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.520> sash<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.969> who<00:01:57.090> cares

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
either way it's just a sash so who cares

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.999 
either way it's just a sash so who cares
it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.840> glossy<00:01:58.020> again<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.649> my<00:01:58.740> liking

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
it's a little glossy again for my liking

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.440 
it's a little glossy again for my liking
I<00:01:59.310> think<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> should<00:01:59.700> probably<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> flat

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I think it should probably be a flat

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
I think it should probably be a flat
gray<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> soft<00:02:01.829> material<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.549> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
gray but it's a soft material and it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
gray but it's a soft material and it
floats<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> won't<00:02:03.420> get<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.659> way<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:04.020> any

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
floats so I won't get in the way of any

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.399 
floats so I won't get in the way of any
articulation<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> black<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.600> mostly

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
articulation all of the black is mostly

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.589 
articulation all of the black is mostly
flat<00:02:07.829> Orly<00:02:08.429> satiny<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.239> does<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.569> some

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
flat Orly satiny and it does have some

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.530 
flat Orly satiny and it does have some
blue<00:02:10.020> shading<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.940> really<00:02:11.940> dark<00:02:12.239> blue

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
blue shading on it really dark blue

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.890 
blue shading on it really dark blue
unless<00:02:13.080> I'm<00:02:13.290> making<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.650> up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
unless I'm making it up

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.960 
unless I'm making it up
looks<00:02:14.049> like<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.349> there<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.790> don't<00:02:15.790> know<00:02:15.849> it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
looks like it's there I don't know it

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.100 
looks like it's there I don't know it
looks<00:02:16.120> like<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.390> there<00:02:16.569> so<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.780> gonna<00:02:16.870> say

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
looks like it's there so I'm gonna say

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.470 
looks like it's there so I'm gonna say
it's<00:02:17.230> there<00:02:17.409> as<00:02:18.400> far<00:02:18.610> as<00:02:18.700> articulation<00:02:19.269> goes

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
it's there as far as articulation goes

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.580 
it's there as far as articulation goes
her<00:02:20.140> head<00:02:20.379> is<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.220> fixed<00:02:21.640> ball<00:02:22.060> disc<00:02:22.480> or<00:02:22.780> ball

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
her head is on a fixed ball disc or ball

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.770 
her head is on a fixed ball disc or ball
peg<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.670> there's<00:02:24.909> almost<00:02:25.060> no<00:02:25.360> articulation

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
peg so there's almost no articulation

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.250 
peg so there's almost no articulation
the<00:02:26.319> hair<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.099> relatively<00:02:27.700> stiff<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.629> I<00:02:28.959> mean

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
the hair is relatively stiff so I mean

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.500 
the hair is relatively stiff so I mean
you<00:02:29.379> can<00:02:29.650> move<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.250> head<00:02:30.370> around<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.879> the<00:02:31.060> ball

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you can move the head around on the ball

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.210 
you can move the head around on the ball
peg<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:31.989> it's<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.590> gonna<00:02:32.739> get<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> whole<00:02:33.189> lot

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
peg but it's not gonna get a whole lot

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.640 
peg but it's not gonna get a whole lot
of<00:02:33.459> motion<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.030> if<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.599> look<00:02:34.810> her<00:02:35.140> chin<00:02:35.379> comes

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
of motion and if you look her chin comes

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.039 
of motion and if you look her chin comes
down<00:02:35.859> pretty<00:02:36.129> far<00:02:36.400> into<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.879> neck<00:02:37.030> area<00:02:37.060> so

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
down pretty far into the neck area so

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.240 
down pretty far into the neck area so
you're<00:02:38.260> not<00:02:38.349> gonna<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> whole<00:02:39.040> lot<00:02:39.189> of

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you're not gonna get a whole lot of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.460 
you're not gonna get a whole lot of
motion<00:02:39.730> forward<00:02:40.090> at<00:02:40.420> all<00:02:40.599> that's<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.959> far<00:02:41.200> for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
motion forward at all that's as far for

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.440 
motion forward at all that's as far for
it<00:02:41.560> as<00:02:41.620> it'll<00:02:41.829> go<00:02:41.859> and<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.909> doesn't<00:02:43.180> go<00:02:43.269> back

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
it as it'll go and it doesn't go back

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.210 
it as it'll go and it doesn't go back
because<00:02:43.659> of<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.930> hair<00:02:44.140> obviously<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:45.069> it's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
because of the hair obviously so it's

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.520 
because of the hair obviously so it's
pretty<00:02:45.400> much<00:02:45.519> gonna<00:02:45.790> stay<00:02:46.060> right<00:02:46.239> where<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.569> is

it<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:25.959> exactly<00:03:26.530> what<00:03:26.790> Elektra<00:03:27.790> was<00:03:27.970> with<00:03:28.299> a

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
it is exactly what Elektra was with a

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.170 
it is exactly what Elektra was with a
new<00:03:28.510> head<00:03:28.690> sculpt<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.409> new<00:03:29.560> sash<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.819> that's

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
new head sculpt and a new sash so that's

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.180 
new head sculpt and a new sash so that's
what<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.389> can<00:03:31.480> expect<00:03:31.870> paint<00:03:32.500> application

what you can expect paint application

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.649 
what you can expect paint application

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
does tend to vary a little bit from

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.720 
does tend to vary a little bit from
figure<00:03:35.169> to<00:03:35.290> figure<00:03:35.650> none<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.250> them<00:03:36.459> are

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
figure to figure none of them are

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.670 
figure to figure none of them are
outstanding<00:03:37.230> none<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.349> them<00:03:38.500> are

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
outstanding none of them are

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.369 
outstanding none of them are
particularly<00:03:39.220> horrible<00:03:39.849> so<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.510> do<00:03:40.959> recommend

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
particularly horrible so I do recommend

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.589 
particularly horrible so I do recommend
it<00:03:41.650> if<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.889> can<00:03:42.040> find<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.400> X<00:03:42.549> for<00:03:42.760> speck<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.359> do

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
it if you can find the X for speck I do

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.599 
it if you can find the X for speck I do
suggest<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.290> get<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.560> because<00:03:44.859> who<00:03:45.430> doesn't

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
suggest you get it because who doesn't

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.270 
suggest you get it because who doesn't
like<00:03:45.790> X<00:03:46.030> force<00:03:46.299> figures<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.049> there's<00:03:47.979> nothing

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
like X force figures and there's nothing

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.119 
like X force figures and there's nothing
really<00:03:48.459> particularly<00:03:48.970> wrong<00:03:49.449> with<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.840> so

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
really particularly wrong with it so

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.830 
really particularly wrong with it so
there<00:03:51.129> you<00:03:51.220> have<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.430> stay<00:03:52.000> tuned<00:03:52.269> for<00:03:52.629> the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
there you have it stay tuned for the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.719 
there you have it stay tuned for the
other<00:03:52.959> two<00:03:53.169> X<00:03:53.349> force<00:03:53.560> members<00:03:53.979> and<00:03:54.310> some<00:03:54.579> other

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
other two X force members and some other

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.670 
other two X force members and some other
reviews<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.599> meantime<00:03:55.810> keep<00:03:56.409> collecting

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
reviews in the meantime keep collecting

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.050 
reviews in the meantime keep collecting
I<00:03:57.099> did<00:03:58.090> forget<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.419> mention<00:03:58.659> that<00:03:59.049> she<00:03:59.290> stands

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
I did forget to mention that she stands

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.969 
I did forget to mention that she stands
about<00:04:01.060> six<00:04:01.449> and<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.900> quarter<00:04:02.109> inches<00:04:02.500> tall

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
about six and a quarter inches tall

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.009 
about six and a quarter inches tall
so<00:04:03.159> she's<00:04:03.459> same<00:04:04.060> as<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.269> SHIELD<00:04:04.510> agent<00:04:04.629> and

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
so she's same as the SHIELD agent and

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.540 
so she's same as the SHIELD agent and
Elektra<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.739> that's<00:04:06.699> what<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.090> can<00:04:07.239> expect
