00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.519
 this week the active cameras 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.610
 they were in the German school of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.860
 guatemala where we met the sport west 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.619
 which consists of a development rally 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
 driving where children participated 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.880
 of 1st grade with the objective of 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 experience the various forms of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
 movement through work in 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.939
 team where they joined forces and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.060
 skills through the practice of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.060
 Athletics 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.559
 in this activity it is called athletic kits 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 and it consists of not having a direct shock 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.379
 with another partner there is no competition in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.739
 no time but the activity is 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.080
 gives a relay base all the activity 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.370
 carried out by children is accumulating 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.370
 by taking a tap a while 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 settled down 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.970
 the event included eight stations with 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.030
 rope jump activities career 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.910
 relay ball impulse jumps 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.400
 Side and endurance races 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.560
 among others the sport west port 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.170
 organized and coordinated by the teachers 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.440
 of physical education however a 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.760
 very relevant aspect was the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.710
 involvement of parents 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.700
 who participated in the activity 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 as judges 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.970
 I am very happy that we 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.100
 participating in this activity because it is 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.510
 an activity where we are integrated 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.840
 with children 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.280
 there are many dads around here who have taken 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.800
 the time to share with children 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.869
 truth to support them in an activity as 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.060
 important where they then 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.560
 socialistan with the other children and also 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.560
 they do true sport 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.110
 this event is an example of how the 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.900
 involvement of parents 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.670
 together with the teachers 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.140
 contribute to the comprehensive training of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.500
 children 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 me when I practice as a child education 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.140
 physics helped me to then address 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.810
 a sport in this case was the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.970
 athletics and I still practice sometimes 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 I walk in the mountains 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.500
 I think your slogan in 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.800
 physical education for life one 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.020
 he keeps practicing and what and what one 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.320
 he leaves the children he will serve them for 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.320
 the morning 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.180
 I do not understand 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.180
 good 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.870
 yes 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.510
 the physical education class has 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.390
 evolved and continues to transform 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.680
 to meet its innumerable 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.390
 Many goals believe that the teacher 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.790
 physical occasion is the one that reaches the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.590
 schools to the schools gets the ball out of 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840
 football and he throws them to the kids and that 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.640
 it's not like that I think that the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.640
 physical teacher preparation 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.300
 now it is more specific than in others 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.730
 years 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.730
 in the middle of June drums 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.360
 remember to make the most of your class 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.080
 of physical education and enjoy all 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 its benefits
