so what we've done is an aggregate

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.140

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
under one portal called snapfinger and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
under one portal called snapfinger and
we've<00:00:36.450> created<00:00:36.750> an<00:00:37.079> application<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
we've created an application and a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.490 
we've created an application and a
mobile<00:00:38.430> device<00:00:38.670> based<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.840> geographic

subway so the unique thing is when I now

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.779

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
to be in an interactive menu that's tied

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.839 
to be in an interactive menu that's tied
real-time<00:01:53.229> directly<00:01:54.039> into<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.459> point<00:01:54.759> of

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
real-time directly into the point of

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.160 
real-time directly into the point of
sale<00:01:54.909> system<00:01:55.149> for<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:55.990> particular

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
of synchronization of real-time menu

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.499 
of synchronization of real-time menu
changes<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.709> menu<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:07.149> can<00:02:07.179> look
