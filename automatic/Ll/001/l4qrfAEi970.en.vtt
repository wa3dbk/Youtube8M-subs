blood flow to my head and so I just saw
that<00:00:55.430> as<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.610> sign<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.270> needed<00:00:56.450> to<00:00:56.660> stop<00:00:56.899> the

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
that as a sign that I needed to stop the

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.710 
that as a sign that I needed to stop the
fast<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.840> for<00:00:59.840> a<00:00:59.870> while<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.380> took<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.670> know

a lot better and then we got some test

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.430 
a lot better and then we got some test
results<00:01:29.240> back<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.950> looked<00:01:31.159> like<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.700> had<00:01:32.440> an

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
results back and it looked like I had an

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.950 
results back and it looked like I had an
aldosterone<00:01:34.310> imbalance<00:01:34.939> which<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.750> lot<00:01:35.930> of

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
aldosterone imbalance which a lot of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.469 
aldosterone imbalance which a lot of
times<00:01:36.170> people<00:01:36.380> can<00:01:36.710> get<00:01:36.890> from<00:01:37.369> having<00:01:37.939> you

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
times people can get from having you

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.090 
times people can get from having you
know<00:01:38.600> like<00:01:38.930> imbalanced<00:01:39.500> hormones<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.950> their

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
know like imbalanced hormones with their

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.380 
know like imbalanced hormones with their
adrenals<00:01:40.549> if<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.850> have<00:01:40.939> adrenal<00:01:41.299> problems

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
adrenals if you have adrenal problems

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.700 
adrenals if you have adrenal problems
and<00:01:42.130> so<00:01:43.130> i<00:01:43.430> just<00:01:43.670> added<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.090> little<00:01:44.270> bit<00:01:44.360> of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
and so i just added a little bit of

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.230 
and so i just added a little bit of
sodium<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.979> my<00:01:46.100> diet<00:01:46.369> just<00:01:46.700> natural<00:01:47.830> salt<00:01:48.830> that

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
sodium to my diet just natural salt that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.140 
sodium to my diet just natural salt that
dr.<00:01:50.240> Nick<00:01:50.420> had<00:01:50.570> from<00:01:50.840> Kenya<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.150> immediately

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
dr. Nick had from Kenya and immediately

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.050 
dr. Nick had from Kenya and immediately
my<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:54.530> blood<00:01:54.860> pressure<00:01:55.130> shot<00:01:55.490> up<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.000> I

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
my like blood pressure shot up and I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.210 
my like blood pressure shot up and I
felt<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:56.689> much<00:01:56.869> better<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:57.619> much<00:01:57.770> clearer

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
felt so much better and so much clearer

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.249 
felt so much better and so much clearer
and<00:01:58.460> I've<00:01:59.360> had<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.540> lot<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.810> really<00:02:00.110> great

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
and I've had a lot of really great

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.100 
and I've had a lot of really great
results<00:02:00.470> from<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.040> fast<00:02:01.280> too<00:02:01.869> when<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.900> first

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
results from the fast too when I first

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.749 
results from the fast too when I first
came<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.380> here<00:02:03.439> I<00:02:03.619> was<00:02:03.860> still<00:02:04.100> dealing<00:02:04.610> with

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
came out here I was still dealing with

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.149 
came out here I was still dealing with
some<00:02:05.270> brain<00:02:05.570> fog<00:02:05.840> issues<00:02:06.290> which<00:02:06.680> apparently

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
some brain fog issues which apparently

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.960 
some brain fog issues which apparently
had<00:02:07.700> come<00:02:07.909> from<00:02:08.229> some<00:02:09.229> severe<00:02:10.039> liver<00:02:10.640> damage

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
had come from some severe liver damage

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.210 
had come from some severe liver damage
that<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.420> had<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:12.439> been<00:02:12.709> pretty

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
that I had and so that's been pretty

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.630 
that I had and so that's been pretty
much<00:02:13.370> cleared<00:02:13.760> up<00:02:13.909> I<00:02:14.120> feel<00:02:14.390> like<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.900> had
