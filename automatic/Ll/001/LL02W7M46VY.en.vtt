00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.230
 welcome to another 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.850
 broadcast by bicker ftv the reportage 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.150
 my name is from now and now 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.080
 we are in the best weather yes in the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.620
 near Paderborn 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.269
 there is the bus manufacturer vdl and the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 Today is the day of the open door that is 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.470
 everything around the bus from 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.910
 small to big is shown that 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.910
 we show you today in this show 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.130
 vdl has pulls that is the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.320
 line bus variant also one 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.850
 electrical drive done here, after all 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.740
 So this vehicle is driving 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.280
 electrically and here at the back 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.500
 hinterachse 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.420
 there are the electric motors 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.720
 once clearly left or right 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.880
 logical and nice to see on the axis 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.860
 that is when you find the rim here 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.979
 looks a bit different 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.570
 than the one you usually know like that 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.180
 system in individual looks as look 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.520
 we are equal in it when manufacturers 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.490
 but also it pulls it pulls this time 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.110
 without electrics that means round 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.300
 electric drive with one 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.460
 normal rims as they are here 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.710
 So does the fact you can already a 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.320
 sees the electrics and not one 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.880
 electric from the outside 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.500
 Electrical connection is also called 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.210
 Auntie a bit different and although here 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.640
 not with the pump 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.020
 well petrol pump already end but this time 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.520
 with electricity 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.710
 that's what the future looks like that means 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.520
 that's what's coming up next 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 power plants here where I now 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.530
 usually the diesel engine the big one 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.690
 diesel engine around this vehicle too 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.280
 But moving here is an electric motor 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.909
 two electric motors are better 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.470
 the built-in 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.910
 So you can save the space 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 and so you come back too 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 posti 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.749
 noiseless movement in the new moves 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.579
 their prototypes with electric drive too 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.870
 not an idea and will be with you 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:27.099
 prove security in the future 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.719
 and you hear very quietly drives the 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.719
 Bus there wonderful thing 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.400
 with me is Mr. expression of ch Beck 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.800
 and we have the electric drive we 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.110
 already above at the smaller lines going on 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.450
 have developed and now 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.550
 you just have to help me , what is there 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.680
 in power what is there accordingly 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.140
 so special country good we have here 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.030
 can you complete other machine yes 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.250
 drive off the drive direct then 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.970
 From the wheel hub familiar we have 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.800
 seen 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.880
 we have just gone so and 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.380
 they already have an effective impression 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.090
 won 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.770
 Here you can see the whole model of 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.080
 the axis like her upper in the bus 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.210
 is built in we have promoters here 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.640
 maximum of 6000 newton meters so at 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:39.480
 the axis of 12,000 12,000 of the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.720
 performance her 183 83 kilo watt an 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.520
 performance as a gentleman and about 113 as 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.280
 Rated limit 2700 meters I stop 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.100
 ppps are played slowly then 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.580
 times converted 13 6 mister kommissar 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.440
 about so on the company ps4 so that 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.210
 what you need so what should I now 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.590
 that the ps number is necessarily it is 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.310
 necessary is women 's moment 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.040
 topic he means 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.850
 that's what she brings forward 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.380
 of course now with two electric motors 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.410
 An impressive central electric motor 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.300
 For example, name already says only one 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.620
 motor in it 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.240
 have two here and of course there are 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.880
 then the performance outside 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.500
 have heard or experienced was the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.630
 lobes 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.060
 unlike other systems it was 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.160
 very quiet so we went and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.830
 have thought if it is the engine out there 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.210
 this tingling comes to every driver 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.840
 a bit comprehensive 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.360
 stall 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.940
 he is just then there but expecting 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.290
 that it then goes on and then sat down 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.760
 that means again if he does not 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.430
 The electric motor is then used 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.160
 then if there can be no electricity like that 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.210
 is quite simply the difference 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.940
 Of course, advertise here too 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.100
 At that time, synchronous machine excited completely 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.870
 gear going we do have one so we 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.210
 Driven in the system, how's it ? 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.310
 financially out for electronic 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.010
 Two separate motors are modeled 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.970
 his single wheel drive yes that 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.400
 clearly different 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.310
 after that then form ironic and it's 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.940
 to the steering wheel 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.880
 and so it will be accordingly 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.960
 controlled refined okay but we 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.060
 made us really live in 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.970
 try the question asked how 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.669
 This can be difficult without differential 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.210
 but it is feasible in the case 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.800
 no problem 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.810
 but now that is super single mature yes 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.180
 what already seen super single tires 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.580
 why it happens so good we got us 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.640
 in the beginning when we started with 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.010
 Electromobility thinks about how I get 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.870
 the most efficient system 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.790
 there is the point gear i have 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.380
 losses in it so that one the gear 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.840
 outside a manual transmission no 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.910
 Planetary gearbox is the one time 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.740
 Many people forget wheels or tires 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.450
 probably everyone got the information from 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.220
 the manufacturers of super single tires 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.570
 are about 17 to 20 percent less 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.880
 rolling resistance in contrast to 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.880
 twin tires so i try 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.290
 anywhere degree in electric mobility 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.080
 save energy I trade mine 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.850
 lightbulbs vs leds i look that 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.600
 I put my air conditioning heat pump in it 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.050
 have such things 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.330
 because I can grab it lying there 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.790
 I do what we do and we are 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.680
 that means it also saves you weight 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.160
 still weight and so on and changed 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.290
 immediately 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.490
 And the development goes though that 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.590
 you still someday 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.410
 Gemini it is quite clear we 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.030
 have conversations also with baic use 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.710
 then had it accordingly and it is 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.960
 Of course, such a logistical have the 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.370
 always the same tire size and there does 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.680
 It would be a bit harder if 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.520
 you see okay I mean second 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:40.640
 tire size and should we now and 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.870
 but rather twin tires the best 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.180
 system in the market 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.770
 if the customers would need to hold it though 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.590
 for some reasons anyway 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.700
 react to it are currently in 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.620
 the next generation to the next 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.740
 generation of electric motors then or 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.820
 wheel hub drive to manufacture and have 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.230
 then, of course , very clearly in focus 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.030
 that there is the possibility and 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.620
 I also have your special rims too 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.990
 why he did the clinic tires then 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.030
 to realize 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.130
 if that makes so much sense now no 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.440
 the customer wants you to focus on it 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.200
 responds wonderfully so I'm curious 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.550
 on the new development and maybe 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.310
 We come to you to say to Cologne 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:22.790
 then you get there so are there to stay 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:25.190
 still there on their many thanks there 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.130
 So that 's it for the electro 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.200
 friends 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.270
 that was it from the house fair of vdl in 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.400
 My name is also in daniels and 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.500
 I'm looking forward to the next bkf 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.500
 tv the reportage until soon
