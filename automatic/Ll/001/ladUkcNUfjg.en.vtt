in<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.590> many<00:00:25.710> ways<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.880> released

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
in so many ways when we first released

by nine display we've actually figured
out<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:53.870> way<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.170> taking<00:00:54.469> that<00:00:54.829> glass<00:00:55.129> right<00:00:56.089> to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
out a way of taking that glass right to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.549 
out a way of taking that glass right to
the<00:00:56.480> very<00:00:56.600> perimeter

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
the very perimeter

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.009 
the very perimeter
it's<00:00:58.010> just<00:00:58.339> display<00:00:58.790> and<00:00:59.089> there<00:00:59.390> no<00:00:59.570> display

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
it's just display and there no display

it's just display and there no display
that's<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:00.799> mean<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.699> are<00:01:01.879> just<00:01:01.909> completely

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:03.369 
that's it I mean you are just completely

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.570 
that's it I mean you are just completely
consumed<00:01:04.369> by<00:01:04.699> by<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.479> image<00:01:06.340> there's<00:01:07.340> not<00:01:07.549> a

we're<00:03:05.230> including<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.769> as<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.980> standard<00:03:06.580> feature

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
we're including it as a standard feature

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.380 
we're including it as a standard feature
of<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.180> new<00:03:07.299> iMac<00:03:08.489> when<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.610> first<00:03:09.970> see<00:03:10.239> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
of the new iMac when you first see the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.309 
of the new iMac when you first see the
mouse<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:11.140> could<00:03:11.590> not<00:03:12.010> be<00:03:12.190> any<00:03:12.220> simpler<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:14.260> I

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.110 
mouse it could not be any simpler but I
love<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.650> way<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:15.040> scales<00:03:15.549> from<00:03:15.849> being

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
love the way that it scales from being

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.250 
love the way that it scales from being
something<00:03:16.390> that<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.799> apparently<00:03:18.220> simple

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
something that is that apparently simple

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.559 
something that is that apparently simple
so<00:03:20.260> actually<00:03:20.560> being<00:03:21.030> really<00:03:22.030> remarkably

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
so actually being really remarkably

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.199 
so actually being really remarkably
sophisticated<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:23.590> mean<00:03:23.769> we've<00:03:24.549> finally

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
sophisticated I mean we've finally

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.229 
sophisticated I mean we've finally
figured<00:03:25.540> out<00:03:25.660> how<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.200> take<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.549> multi-touch

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
figured out how to take the multi-touch

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.400 
figured out how to take the multi-touch
technology<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:29.579> implement<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.820> mouse

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
technology and implement it on a mouse

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.500 
technology and implement it on a mouse
it's<00:03:32.410> still<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.739> point-and-click<00:03:33.280> mouse<00:03:33.700> but

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
it's still a point-and-click mouse but

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.380 
it's still a point-and-click mouse but
now<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.290> entire<00:03:35.799> top<00:03:36.459> surface<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> mouse

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
now the entire top surface of the mouse

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.539 
now the entire top surface of the mouse
is<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:38.350> basically<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.100> multi-touch

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
is is basically it's a multi-touch

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.819 
is is basically it's a multi-touch
sensor<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.049> smartest<00:03:41.410> Mouse<00:03:41.590> we've

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
sensor this is the smartest Mouse we've

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.949 
sensor this is the smartest Mouse we've
ever<00:03:41.980> made<00:03:42.190> there's<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.030> chip<00:03:43.359> inside<00:03:43.690> that

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
ever made there's a chip inside that

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.259 
ever made there's a chip inside that
acts<00:03:44.170> essentially<00:03:44.709> as<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.829> brain<00:03:45.130> as<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:46.090> put

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
acts essentially as a brain as you put

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.819 
acts essentially as a brain as you put
your<00:03:46.390> fingers<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.959> top<00:03:47.200> shelf<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.650> can

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
your fingers on the top shelf it can

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.520 
your fingers on the top shelf it can
determine<00:03:48.250> where<00:03:49.090> they're<00:03:49.299> located<00:03:49.510> how<00:03:50.230> many

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
determine where they're located how many

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.009 
determine where they're located how many
you<00:03:50.739> have<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.280> through<00:03:51.910> your<00:03:52.060> gesture<00:03:52.630> your

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
you have and through your gesture your

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.020 
you have and through your gesture your
movement<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.769> can<00:03:54.069> determine<00:03:54.430> what<00:03:54.850> your

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
movement it can determine what your

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.949 
movement it can determine what your
intent<00:03:55.359> is<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:57.100> can<00:03:57.370> scroll<00:03:57.940> anywhere<00:03:58.870> on

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
intent is you can scroll anywhere on

real<00:04:38.160> workhorse

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
real workhorse

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.330 
real workhorse
those<00:04:39.389> are<00:04:39.570> workstation<00:04:40.229> class<00:04:40.530> technologies

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
those are workstation class technologies

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.550 
those are workstation class technologies
that<00:04:41.970> are<00:04:42.120> really<00:04:42.360> built<00:04:42.599> in<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.870> consumer

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
that are really built in a consumer

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.650 
that are really built in a consumer
computer<00:04:46.280> we're<00:04:47.280> really<00:04:47.550> proud<00:04:47.849> of<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.240> iMac

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
computer we're really proud of this iMac

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.659 
computer we're really proud of this iMac
especially<00:04:49.440> in<00:04:49.560> terms<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.039> environment

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
especially in terms of the environment

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.060 
especially in terms of the environment
but<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.509> key<00:04:51.660> with<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:51.930> environmental<00:04:52.650> story

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
but the key with the environmental story

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.879 
but the key with the environmental story
is<00:04:53.310> it's<00:04:53.639> never<00:04:54.000> over<00:04:54.270> because<00:04:55.259> as<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:55.620> learn

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
is it's never over because as you learn

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.790 
is it's never over because as you learn
how<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.550> remove<00:04:56.970> toxins<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.380> change<00:04:58.650> your

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
how to remove toxins you change your

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.670 
how to remove toxins you change your
focus<00:04:58.979> from<00:04:59.370> doing<00:04:59.639> that<00:04:59.849> to<00:05:00.229> how<00:05:01.229> do<00:05:01.289> we<00:05:01.410> build

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
focus from doing that to how do we build

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.770 
focus from doing that to how do we build
this<00:05:01.889> thing<00:05:02.130> really<00:05:02.660> energy-efficient<00:05:03.660> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
this thing really energy-efficient and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.680 
this thing really energy-efficient and
not<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.770> meet<00:05:04.949> Energy<00:05:05.400> Star<00:05:05.759> but<00:05:06.449> to<00:05:06.570> go

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
not just to meet Energy Star but to go

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.999 
not just to meet Energy Star but to go
way<00:05:06.900> beyond<00:05:07.259> that<00:05:08.599> we<00:05:09.599> take<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> lifecycle<00:05:10.500> view

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
way beyond that we take a lifecycle view

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.670 
way beyond that we take a lifecycle view
of<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.520> carbon<00:05:11.849> footprint<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:13.410> find

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
of the carbon footprint and you find

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.830 
of the carbon footprint and you find
that<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:14.430> customers<00:05:14.880> use<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.360> computer

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
that the customers use of the computer

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.499 
that the customers use of the computer
has<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.680> biggest<00:05:17.130> impact<00:05:17.849> on<00:05:18.030> its<00:05:18.240> carbon

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
has the biggest impact on its carbon

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.469 
has the biggest impact on its carbon
footprint<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:20.070> in<00:05:20.430> this<00:05:20.789> product<00:05:21.120> we

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
footprint and so in this product we

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.510 
footprint and so in this product we
really<00:05:21.750> drove<00:05:22.020> at<00:05:22.229> energy<00:05:22.650> efficiency<00:05:22.680> and

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
really drove at energy efficiency and

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.040 
really drove at energy efficiency and
that's<00:05:24.000> where<00:05:24.180> we<00:05:24.300> have<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.449> tremendous

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
that's where we have a tremendous

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.830 
that's where we have a tremendous
advantage<00:05:25.349> because<00:05:26.190> we<00:05:26.370> not<00:05:26.820> only<00:05:26.880> build<00:05:27.659> the

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
advantage because we not only build the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.749 
advantage because we not only build the
hardware<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:28.560> we<00:05:28.680> also<00:05:28.860> create<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.550> software

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
hardware but we also create the software

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.140 
hardware but we also create the software
so<00:05:30.750> we're<00:05:31.380> able<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.620> really<00:05:31.979> manage<00:05:32.490> power<00:05:32.849> and

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
so we're able to really manage power and

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.689 
so we're able to really manage power and
throughout<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.659> system<00:05:33.889> extensively<00:05:34.889> we

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
throughout the system extensively we

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.520 
throughout the system extensively we
even<00:05:35.940> power<00:05:36.150> down<00:05:36.389> processors<00:05:37.080> between

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
even power down processors between

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.100 
even power down processors between
keystrokes<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.449> think<00:05:39.720> we're<00:05:39.930> really

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
keystrokes and I think we're really

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.100 
keystrokes and I think we're really
unique<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:41.340> how<00:05:41.550> far<00:05:41.849> we've<00:05:42.150> pushed<00:05:42.539> that

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
unique in how far we've pushed that

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.050 
unique in how far we've pushed that
hardware<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.740> software<00:05:43.919> technology<00:05:44.759> to<00:05:44.880> do

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
hardware and software technology to do

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.589 
hardware and software technology to do
that

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.899 

with<00:05:49.169> this<00:05:49.289> iMac<00:05:49.679> we<00:05:50.069> took<00:05:50.249> everything<00:05:50.520> so

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:50.909 
with this iMac we took everything so

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.540 
with this iMac we took everything so
much<00:05:51.059> further<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:52.259> displays<00:05:52.619> are<00:05:52.740> bigger<00:05:52.919> the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
much further the displays are bigger the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.790 
much further the displays are bigger the
pixel<00:05:53.909> count<00:05:53.939> is<00:05:54.300> higher<00:05:54.509> it<00:05:55.259> comes<00:05:55.529> standard

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
pixel count is higher it comes standard

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.409

are<00:06:11.459> as<00:06:11.879> relevant<00:06:12.689> and<00:06:13.020> as<00:06:13.139> right<00:06:13.409> now<00:06:13.770> as<00:06:14.249> they

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
are as relevant and as right now as they

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.749 
are as relevant and as right now as they
were<00:06:14.969> you<00:06:15.629> know<00:06:15.659> with<00:06:15.929> the<00:06:16.050> first<00:06:16.349> one<00:06:16.589> and<00:06:16.919> so

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
were you know with the first one and so

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.269 
were you know with the first one and so
