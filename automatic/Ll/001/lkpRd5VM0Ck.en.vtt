 Hello everyone and welcome back the video of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.200
 today it is dedicated to the enamel of the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.330
 more than one week has passed 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.150
 week is spent putting the month 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.519
 how much I don't load a new video for it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.130
 But the polish of the week has arrived 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 the glaze I chose is the china glaze 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 which is part of the fluo collection 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 collection and is the number 873 flip flop 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 fantasy already the name says it all in the name 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.880
 of Greece are always like this 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 details or I noticed the same as it is 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 a neon just if the collection is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.090
 called fluo is a really crazy fluo pink 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.399
 how color you respect me knows a lot 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.010
 because I at one and more color are 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.410
 eccentric and crazy the more I like hard 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.100
 when on the street they had to say but that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 i mean i don't like color so i am 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.530
 a little strange I glaze at a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.899
 enough applicator under who 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.930
 I do however see the typical of the channel 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.869
 made this here many don't like me 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.760
 I feel good but it doesn't make me streaks 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.520
 on the drafting upstream they say that grants to 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 grace creates streaks then 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.009
 I show you the application that with 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.130
 the two colors become homogeneous 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.159
 full and covering at the end of the video 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.020
 I also put a link with nail art 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.020
 pass I made with this glaze 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.260
 so this was the polish I have 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.020
 chosen at the end of the video I leave you the 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.930

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.479
