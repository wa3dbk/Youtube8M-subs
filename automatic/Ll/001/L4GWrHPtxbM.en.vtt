 Hello this is Tommy Jacob, Creative Director of Ghost Recon Future Soldier's Multiplayer. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.579
 I am going to give you some more details about the Arctic Strike DLC which contains 3 new multiplayer folders. 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.770
 and the Stockade mode. 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.640
 Players wait in the Stockade in the order in which they were killed. A player is released each 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 once an enemy is killed. Every few minutes an objective appears for each team that, if the if 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.780
 is achieved, the entire team will be released from the Stockade. 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.690
 The general objective in Stockade is simple: kill without being killed yourself and eliminate the whole 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.060
 enemy team before the time runs out. In the event of a tie, the number of teamwork points determine the final 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.030
 winner. Stockade is playable on all 13 multiplayer folders. 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.940
 Here are some pro tips to get you started. Use the lens as a bait. Ambush your enemy 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 when they try to free their teammates. Don't go for the objective as just one of your team members 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.390
 stuck. Finally: a data hack almost guarantees the victory. Finally: one data hack almost guarantees the victory. 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.509
 There are three new larger multiplayer folders in Arctic Strike: Riot, Evicted and Skyline. 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.890
 Riot places players in the center of Moscow. The empty streets ensure long missions 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.659
 as the enemy moves between burned out cars. The short corners of the alleys are excellent 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.149
 locations to trap your enemy with a shotgun or well-placed material. 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.249
 Evicted continues the fight in the streets of Moscow as the fight ends in a quiet residential 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:28.920
 neighborhood.With long alleys between the large apartment buildings, snipers are of great value. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.700
 Sensors and UAVs are less effective in this extensive location. Communication 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.600
 is very important to detect and control enemy movement. Skyline is a two-story CQB nightmare. Connected 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.479
 the limited access points of this level provide the perfection locations via tunnels and stairs 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.310
 to put traps. Snipers shoot at each other in the towers and provide cover to their team members as they attempt to penetrate further 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.490
 in enemy territory. An experienced UCAV or UAV pilot can force the enemy into open territory 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.509
 and so also in the kill zone.
