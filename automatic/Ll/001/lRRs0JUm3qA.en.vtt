00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.070

 No big forest is along until 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.940
 to Spain from which he probably from the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.530

 bottleneck and leaves no one by love 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.159
 Karl the Great told Roland about me 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.890
