 and you knew it 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.780
 I saw him standing and then I thought that is 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680
 one that is the man of my members also the 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.250

 they are standing and yes yes it was very small 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.020
 year with this winter rear taxi 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.050
 I let myself be told 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.860
 is therefore correct what did not want to leave 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.790

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.890

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.940

 who can cook a little he has whole 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.920
 cheap yes I thought anyway 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.720
 that eating and cooking you are a huge 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.050
 important role is that correct 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.330
 is right 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.700
 you always cook together on how it works 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.220
 that usually together and always 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.410
 candles at the table 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.210
 indeed you dare not say anything anymore 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.320
 and how did your mutual react 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.030
 parents when you tell you 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.310

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.790

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.220
 yet who screamed so terribly through the 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:22.060
 phone 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.060
 math ice will have someone at times 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:29.849
 difficult and I am 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.619
 we are going to tell you 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:33.119
 game for far too long for not exactly 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.469
 to know how to tidy those seeds 

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:36.389
 but everyone and you do that 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:38.249
 has earned it 30 points 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.580
 and with those scoring we move on to the 

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.580
 second round
