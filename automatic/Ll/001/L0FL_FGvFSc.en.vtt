00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.349
 Why 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.870
 classically we are used to say that in Agenda 21 is declined according to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.250
 the 21 chapters that are identified for local authorities 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.170
 it is not a constituent element of the city 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.329
 there are non-university skills so it's clear that 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.559
 some chapters finally from the classic 21 agenda 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 local agenda type 21 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 they can not treat them at the university level from the point of view 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.390
 so much incompetence and dupont and the relevance of the scale 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.100
 on the other hand 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.460
 m certain chapters 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 of his resolutely responsibility for the establishment 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.760
 in several ways 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.860
 at the same time playing the role of exemplary state since I 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.730
 recalls in public institution 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.310
 playing the role that is ours of training the citizens of tomorrow so 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.430
 why not associate what we call for the formation of 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.100
 the eco-citizen and is responsible for the very responsibility of the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.369
 migration which consists of saving money while promoting 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.460
 sustainable development 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.740
 so the guidance that has been given here according to the priority of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.130
 actions that were launched 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.320
 it was mostly 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.650
 e how can one reasonably trade an immediate enjoyment 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.500
 controlling long-term well-being for the establishment 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.039
 in a first phase with this is a d that is readable 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.210
 and above all that benefits users every year a staff 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.350
 the carbon balance dialo primarily summer percent 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.930
 to launch in collaboration with the regional environmental agency normandie 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.960
 because of the existing partnership between the university is thus question 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.190
 the local displacement plan 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.230
 taking this opportunity of the opportunity of the law of February 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.730
 2007 it seems to me percent promoting the big seven nights in for 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.399
 to summarize 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:20.510
 for 100 m there has been 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.460
 yells afterwards all that has been improved her living environment with 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.839
 more responsible management of our green spaces 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.889
 for the widespread introduction of the selective collection of all 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.139
 university waste 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.349
 and here it should be noted that this and it still answered a request 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.869
 since league for a 12 month 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.559
 dating alert thresholds 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.619
 the selective collection policy is correctly applied by the whole 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:46.259
 actors after 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.949
 the strength of his first visible experiences we still insist 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.249
 much about communicating our actions we also have thematically a 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.339
 quite broad decision our results in a near-by-an elected 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.559
 but the gloves 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.329
 1200 people abducted at national level 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.810
 % after mans asked us to intervene them there were returns 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.900
 of experience who has exchanges of experiences and in aoc continue to 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.519
 strengthen our action programs 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.010
 euronews now go up to worry about water management 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.080
 rain with 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.989
 in euros the view this morning 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.650
 filter basin installations 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.760
 in the of us for them the journey 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.999
 at the top of the rainwater 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.769
 % and the systematic consideration in all our public markets of 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.639
 criteria 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.409
 to link to eco-responsibility at a standstill are celebrated social of 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.290
 business 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.369
 to select our providers 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.879
 whatever the fields of intervention 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.920
 there was also percent and systematic consideration in everything 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.489
 what he does after finally to the building of all criteria related to 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.510
 the wheel sustainable development arcep simply has the criteria the energy that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.840
 as 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.860
 the bbc revealed low consumption 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.320
 % and it's also about the mutability of private buildings that 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.570
 is no longer a question of requalifying today in space 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.810
 it is agreed that he will have her child her final destination at conferences 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.600
 so that 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.029
 a building is not reviewed once and for all 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 destined for one and the same use 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.480
 having carbon people from the university gave us a motive 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.630
 relevant 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.849
 for actually 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.080
 reconsider our air conditioning system instead of having the 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.809
 air conditioning reflex today we have the reflex 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:21.049
 ventilation but not systematically oriented on air conditioning example 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:21.949
 also 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.559
 a balance sheet stay on displacements actually brought us to arles 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.589
 act and politically within the institution promoting the 

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.589
 videoconferencing 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:38.019
 exemplarity cited him the forwards the topic and and can be targeted on 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.990
 very early creation of a mandatory service 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.440
 to dirty city 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.560
 even before the law texts the ump proposes the creation of this type of 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.170
 service 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.910
 in addition to a service we made a direction that service it is 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.250
 composed today on raw resources cited is enough 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.130
 rare to be happy this furniture 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.130
 % is composed of a director percent permanent title 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.729
 two auxiliaries of life actually a secretariat in premises that 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:07.939
 does not offer that come 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.069
 the place a few weeks the to be delivered 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.520
 at the level of solidarity we work enormously also 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.430
 for the point of international cooperation but also 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.650
 when I spoke international cooperation about the touch 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.290
 everything in the pac had students 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.490
 and not only strangers who presents distress criteria there 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.020
 is a lot considering the current context of students 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.129
 in distress 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.349
 % lead 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.490
 our cooperation and our local solidarity 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.710
 it focuses on structuring and recognition and development 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.330
 background 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.100
 but also 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.590
 who go to these individuals 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.630
 without it being assimilated to assistantship, these are measures 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.139
 of accompaniment to help people get by and not measures I would say 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:48.530
 of care
