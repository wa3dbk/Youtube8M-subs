really very neutral you can use them on

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
really very neutral you can use them on
short<00:00:19.619> nail<00:00:19.890> or<00:00:20.130> long<00:00:20.699> nail<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.180> really

whatever<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.640> hell<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:31.130> then<00:00:32.130> t1<00:00:32.579> with

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
whatever the hell you want then t1 with

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.049 
whatever the hell you want then t1 with
the<00:00:33.149> wheel<00:00:33.360> usually<00:00:33.750> works<00:00:34.710> best<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the wheel usually works best when you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.160 
the wheel usually works best when you
cut<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.660> nail<00:00:36.780> very<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.410> short<00:00:38.960> then<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
cut your nail very very short then this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.950 
cut your nail very very short then this
is<00:00:40.290> how<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.440> put<00:00:40.739> them<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.940> press<00:00:42.329> very

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
is how you put them on you press very

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
is how you put them on you press very
firmly<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.340> actually<00:00:44.730> your<00:00:44.940> nail<00:00:45.329> does

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
firmly and you actually your nail does

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.110 
firmly and you actually your nail does
not<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.840> more<00:00:46.110> than<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.730> because<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> wheel

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
not go more than this because the wheel

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
not go more than this because the wheel
is<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.140> gap<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:50.039> nail<00:00:50.219> sticks

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
is actually a gap and your nail sticks

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.900 
is actually a gap and your nail sticks
here<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.930> does<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.649> over<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> press

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
here it does not go over when you press

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.779 
here it does not go over when you press
and<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.320> perfect<00:00:55.829> match<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.640> how

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and this is a perfect match this is how

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.680 
and this is a perfect match this is how
it<00:00:56.940> should<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:58.460> for<00:00:59.460> example<00:00:59.550> if<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.390> put<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it should be for example if you put it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.979 
it should be for example if you put it
on<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> longer<00:01:01.410> nail<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.149> work<00:01:03.180> as

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
on a longer nail this will not work as

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.649 
on a longer nail this will not work as
good<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:06.170> can<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.530> my<00:01:07.740> nail<00:01:07.920> does<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.430> over

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
good I can like my nail does not go over

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
good I can like my nail does not go over
but<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.530> secure<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.220> half<00:01:11.909> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
but it's not so secure because half of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.560 
but it's not so secure because half of
the<00:01:12.360> nail<00:01:13.320> tip<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.010> your<00:01:14.580> white<00:01:15.090> part<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the nail tip is on your white part of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
the nail tip is on your white part of
nail<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> flexible<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.320> so

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
nail that is flexible and is not so

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.510 
nail that is flexible and is not so
strong<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.000> feel<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
strong and I can actually feel it and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.109 
strong and I can actually feel it and
secure<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.909> nail<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:25.670> so<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> what

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
secure on my nail right now so that what

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.260 
secure on my nail right now so that what
a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.750> people<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.439> does<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.909> put<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
a lot of people do does is they put it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.460 
a lot of people do does is they put it
more<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:30.810> below<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> glue<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.220> up<00:01:32.369> here

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
more down below and glue them up here

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.149 
more down below and glue them up here
the<00:01:34.470> risk<00:01:34.920> by<00:01:35.460> doing<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the risk by doing so is that you have

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.270 
the risk by doing so is that you have
air<00:01:38.610> bubbles<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> wheel<00:01:39.930> area<00:01:40.439> because

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
air bubbles in the wheel area because

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.219 
air bubbles in the wheel area because
the<00:01:41.430> wheel<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> gap<00:01:43.520> okay<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.930> when<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> put

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the wheel is a gap okay so when you put

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.719 
the wheel is a gap okay so when you put
it<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> nail<00:01:46.770> you're<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.460> air

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it on the nail you're going to have air

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
it on the nail you're going to have air
bubbles<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> way<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> prevent<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.829> stop

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
bubbles the way to prevent that stop

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.389 
bubbles the way to prevent that stop
from<00:01:53.159> stop<00:01:53.430> happening<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.409> more<00:01:55.950> glue

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
from stop happening is to put more glue

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.600 
from stop happening is to put more glue
in<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.850> wheel<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> usually<00:01:57.840> would

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
in the wheel then you usually would

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.499 
in the wheel then you usually would
press<00:01:59.610> very<00:02:00.000> firmly<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:01.500> five<00:02:01.710> seconds<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
press very firmly for five seconds and

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.200 
press very firmly for five seconds and
wipe<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.869> excess<00:02:04.049> gel<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.520> excess<00:02:05.820> gel<00:02:06.030> will

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
wipe the excess gel the excess gel will

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.770 
wipe the excess gel the excess gel will
come<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.990> smile<00:02:07.320> line<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.629> what

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
come on your smile line so this is what

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
come on your smile line so this is what
most<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> people<00:02:10.410> does

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
most of the people does

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.300 
most of the people does
I<00:02:12.170> personally<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.440> more<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.720> but

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
I personally like more this one here but

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030 
I personally like more this one here but
this<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.459> here<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:17.940> much<00:02:18.300> easier<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.690> find

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
this one here is much easier to find

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.120 
this one here is much easier to find
they<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.340> slightly<00:02:20.760> cheaper<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.890> they<00:02:22.890> come

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
they are slightly cheaper and they come

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.750 
they are slightly cheaper and they come
in<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.490> variety<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:24.209> colors<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.170> models<00:02:25.760> for

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720
