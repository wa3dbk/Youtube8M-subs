last<00:00:00.599> month<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:01.020> posted<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.439> video<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:01.979> an

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
last month I posted a video and an

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.550 
last month I posted a video and an
accompanying<00:00:02.610> shoot<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.720> was<00:00:03.959> all<00:00:04.259> about

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
accompanying shoot that was all about

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.710 
accompanying shoot that was all about
capturing<00:00:04.859> an<00:00:05.220> iconic<00:00:05.609> image<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.060> talked<00:00:06.600> about

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
capturing an iconic image I talked about

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.509 
capturing an iconic image I talked about
how<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> lot<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.290> those<00:00:07.470> iconic<00:00:07.859> images<00:00:08.340> that

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
how a lot of those iconic images that

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.490 
how a lot of those iconic images that
you<00:00:08.580> might<00:00:08.730> think<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.120> are<00:00:09.360> simple<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.110> not

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
you might think of are simple and not

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.950 
you might think of are simple and not
necessarily<00:00:10.650> formally<00:00:11.580> post<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.780> video

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
necessarily formally post in that video

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.110 
necessarily formally post in that video
I<00:00:13.110> focused<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.710> using<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.250> simple<00:00:14.519> look<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I focused on using a simple look and a

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
I focused on using a simple look and a
simple<00:00:15.330> setup<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> didn't<00:00:16.800> talk<00:00:16.980> too<00:00:17.160> much

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
simple setup what I didn't talk too much

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.650 
simple setup what I didn't talk too much
about<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.760> how<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> actually<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.539> your

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
about was how to actually have your

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380 
about was how to actually have your
model<00:00:18.960> pose<00:00:19.199> or<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:20.400> pose<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.880> case<00:00:21.150> may

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
model pose or not pose as the case may

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
model pose or not pose as the case may
be<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.750> how<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.740> help<00:00:22.890> yourself<00:00:23.070> capture

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
be and how you can help yourself capture

be and how you can help yourself capture
the<00:00:23.910> moment<00:00:24.240> let's<00:00:24.660> talk<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.230> now

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the moment let's talk about that now

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
the moment let's talk about that now
when<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.099> shooting<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.490> model<00:00:26.789> often

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
when you are shooting a model often

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.089 
when you are shooting a model often
times<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.630> want<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.500> into<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.769> pose

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
times we want them to get into that pose

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.510 
times we want them to get into that pose
and<00:00:30.019> then<00:00:31.019> hold<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.710> well<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
and then hold on to it well we the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370 
and then hold on to it well we the
photographers<00:00:33.059> adjust<00:00:33.630> our<00:00:33.780> settings<00:00:34.170> or

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
photographers adjust our settings or

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740 
photographers adjust our settings or
lighting<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> anything<00:00:36.180> else<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.600> may

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
lighting and anything else that we may

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
lighting and anything else that we may
be<00:00:36.809> using<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> perfect<00:00:37.770> photo<00:00:38.180> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
be using to get that perfect photo you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
be using to get that perfect photo you
may<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.629> gone<00:00:39.899> through<00:00:40.140> some<00:00:40.320> pose<00:00:40.440> ideas

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
may have gone through some pose ideas

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.950 
may have gone through some pose ideas
with<00:00:41.399> magazines<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.239> something<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:42.930> e

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
with magazines or something like my e

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.830 
with magazines or something like my e
lookbook<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.739> oh<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.460> fine<00:00:44.730> great<00:00:45.390> even<00:00:45.690> I

lookbook and oh that's fine great even I
love<00:00:46.350> having<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> plan<00:00:46.890> prior<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.399> shooting<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
love having a plan prior to shooting but

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.910 
love having a plan prior to shooting but
here's<00:00:48.510> something<00:00:48.690> else<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> consider<00:00:49.170> when

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
here's something else to consider when

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
here's something else to consider when
you<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> model<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> studio<00:00:51.270> or

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you have a model into the studio or

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
you have a model into the studio or
anywhere<00:00:52.079> really<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.980> about<00:00:53.160> having<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
anywhere really think about having that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
anywhere really think about having that
inspiration<00:00:54.360> whether<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> photo<00:00:55.260> or<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
inspiration whether it be a photo or a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.310 
inspiration whether it be a photo or a
story<00:00:56.129> you've<00:00:56.280> made<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.270> rather<00:00:58.199> than

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
story you've made up then rather than

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
story you've made up then rather than
half<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> model<00:00:59.100> five<00:00:59.309> still<00:00:59.699> pose<00:00:59.969> after

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
half the model five still pose after

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
half the model five still pose after
still<00:01:00.690> pose<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.859> move<00:01:02.370> around<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.820> bit

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
still pose have them move around a bit

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
still pose have them move around a bit
while<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.239> shooting<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
while you're shooting this is going to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.230 
while you're shooting this is going to
serve<00:01:04.530> several<00:01:04.860> purposes<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> first<00:01:06.000> on

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
serve several purposes for you first on

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
serve several purposes for you first on
the<00:01:06.390> technical<00:01:06.750> side<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.960> things<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the technical side of things if you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.620 
the technical side of things if you
instruct<00:01:08.280> your<00:01:08.369> model<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> stay<00:01:09.510> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
instruct your model to kind of stay in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
instruct your model to kind of stay in
the<00:01:09.659> same<00:01:09.869> pose<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.740> move<00:01:11.310> around<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.640> little

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the same pose but move around a little

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
the same pose but move around a little
bit<00:01:11.970> within<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.540> pose<00:01:12.750> you're<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> be

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
bit within the pose you're going to be

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.840 
bit within the pose you're going to be
getting<00:01:13.740> different<00:01:14.010> angles<00:01:14.490> different

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
getting different angles different

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
getting different angles different
angles<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> face<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.350> body<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
angles of the face of the body and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
angles of the face of the body and
hopefully<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.060> angles<00:01:18.420> will<00:01:18.540> be

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
hopefully one of those angles will be

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.660 
hopefully one of those angles will be
the<00:01:18.689> winner<00:01:18.979> similarly<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.250> light<00:01:20.400> will<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the winner similarly the light will be

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.130 
the winner similarly the light will be
hitting<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> model<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.540> her<00:01:21.689> pose<00:01:21.900> in

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
hitting the model in her pose in

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.740 
hitting the model in her pose in
slightly<00:01:22.380> different<00:01:22.500> ways<00:01:23.150> again<00:01:24.150> you're

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
slightly different ways again you're

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.240 
slightly different ways again you're
looking<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> combination<00:01:25.560> where<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
looking for that combination where the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
looking for that combination where the
pose<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> lighting<00:01:26.880> work<00:01:27.150> together<00:01:27.330> the

pose and the lighting work together the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
around a little bit if needed you'll

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
around a little bit if needed you'll
keep<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.630> pose<00:01:39.840> fresh<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.189> models

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
keep the pose fresh because the models

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
keep the pose fresh because the models
still<00:01:41.729> moving<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> probably<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.409> stiffening

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
still moving and probably not stiffening

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
still moving and probably not stiffening
up<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.369> same<00:01:44.640> pose<00:01:44.939> being<00:01:45.210> held<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
up in that same pose being held and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.319 
up in that same pose being held and
hopefully<00:01:46.530> find<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.729> image<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
hopefully find that one image that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.850 
hopefully find that one image that
you're<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.540> for<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:49.409> maybe<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you're looking for or maybe that you

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440 
you're looking for or maybe that you
weren't<00:01:50.040> looking<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.670> found<00:01:50.790> anyway<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
weren't looking for but found anyway and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.830 
weren't looking for but found anyway and
by<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.110> way<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> use<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.270> models

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
by the way it's good to use the models

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440 
by the way it's good to use the models
creativity<00:01:55.500> when<00:01:55.860> moving<00:01:56.399> around<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
creativity when moving around but you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.670 
creativity when moving around but you
know<00:01:57.540> also<00:01:57.840> don't<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.140> afraid<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.439> suggest

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
know also don't be afraid to suggest

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.530 
know also don't be afraid to suggest
ways<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.399> them<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.549> move<00:01:59.759> around<00:01:59.909> either<00:02:00.210> when

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
ways for them to move around either when

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.300 
ways for them to move around either when
a<00:02:00.570> model<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.229> certain<00:02:01.409> pose<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> while

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
a model is in a certain pose for a while

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.850 
a model is in a certain pose for a while
even<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.090> she's<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.509> hit<00:02:03.960> her<00:02:04.140> next<00:02:04.380> pose<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
even if she's just hit her next pose it

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.100 
even if she's just hit her next pose it
can<00:02:05.250> end<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.520> looking<00:02:05.820> stiff<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.719> when<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
can end up looking stiff but when the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.050 
can end up looking stiff but when the
model<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.500> moving<00:02:08.069> around<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.729> will<00:02:08.819> probably

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
model is moving around you will probably

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.839 
model is moving around you will probably
get<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.629> more<00:02:10.080> natural<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.830> relaxed<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.580> I

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
get a more natural or relaxed look I

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
get a more natural or relaxed look I
touched<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.720> second<00:02:13.080> ago

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
touched on that a second ago

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.890 
touched on that a second ago
and<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:14.340> know<00:02:14.460> what<00:02:14.640> from<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.240> experience<00:02:15.780> as

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and you know what from my experience as

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.480 
and you know what from my experience as
a<00:02:15.930> model<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> photographer<00:02:16.980> I've<00:02:17.160> come<00:02:17.400> to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
a model and a photographer I've come to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.150 
a model and a photographer I've come to
realize<00:02:17.850> how<00:02:18.150> much<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.660> actually<00:02:19.010> builds<00:02:20.010> up

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
realize how much this actually builds up

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
realize how much this actually builds up
during<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.580> shoot<00:02:20.790> it's<00:02:21.060> definitely<00:02:21.720> a

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
during the shoot it's definitely a

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.860 
during the shoot it's definitely a
snowball<00:02:22.620> effect<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.460> good<00:02:23.640> way<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:24.060> you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
snowball effect in a good way if you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.050 
snowball effect in a good way if you
have<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:25.290> model<00:02:25.680> moving<00:02:26.220> around<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.790> then

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
have your model moving around and then

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.330 
have your model moving around and then
shaking<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.320> finding<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:28.860> new<00:02:29.010> idea

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
shaking it out and finding a new idea

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.190 
shaking it out and finding a new idea
and<00:02:29.610> moving<00:02:30.090> around<00:02:30.240> there<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> bit<00:02:30.720> you'll

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and moving around there a bit you'll

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
and moving around there a bit you'll
find<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.620> your<00:02:31.800> results<00:02:32.310> will<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.700> better

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
find that your results will get better

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.700 
find that your results will get better
and<00:02:33.300> better<00:02:33.540> as<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> both<00:02:34.320> get<00:02:34.500> more

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
and better as you both get more

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.700 
and better as you both get more
comfortable<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.400> find<00:02:36.060> more<00:02:36.870> kind<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
comfortable and find more kind of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.740 
comfortable and find more kind of
spontaneous<00:02:38.370> shots<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:39.060> other<00:02:39.360> than<00:02:39.540> having

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
spontaneous shots now other than having

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.380 
spontaneous shots now other than having
the<00:02:39.960> model<00:02:40.230> look<00:02:40.560> more<00:02:40.800> relaxed<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.490> natural

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the model look more relaxed and natural

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.480 
the model look more relaxed and natural
while<00:02:42.930> moving<00:02:43.140> around<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.980> might<00:02:44.190> even<00:02:44.220> be

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
while moving around you might even be

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.570 
while moving around you might even be
able<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.850> capture<00:02:45.120> other<00:02:45.660> movements<00:02:46.410> her<00:02:46.980> hair

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
able to capture other movements her hair

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.610 
able to capture other movements her hair
falling<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.780> fabric<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.290> our<00:02:49.380> shirt

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
falling back the fabric of our shirt

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
falling back the fabric of our shirt
moving<00:02:49.950> around<00:02:50.130> her<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.120> give<00:02:51.270> some

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
moving around her this can give some

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.000 
moving around her this can give some
life<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.990> image<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.620> viewer<00:02:52.860> will

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
life to the image that the viewer will

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.620 
life to the image that the viewer will
find<00:02:53.220> interesting<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.090> will

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
find interesting and this will

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.630 
find interesting and this will
definitely<00:02:54.930> extend<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.830> larger<00:02:56.190> movements

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
definitely extend to larger movements

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.670 
definitely extend to larger movements
like<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> model<00:02:57.930> twirling

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
like if you have the model twirling

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.440 
like if you have the model twirling
around<00:02:58.800> or<00:02:59.220> running<00:02:59.520> speaking<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.090> larger

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
around or running speaking of larger

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.390 
around or running speaking of larger
movements<00:03:00.840> especially<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.980> are<00:03:02.160> using

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
movements especially if you are using

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.090 
movements especially if you are using
studio<00:03:02.940> lights<00:03:03.270> or<00:03:03.480> are<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.110> studio<00:03:04.410> make

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
studio lights or are in the studio make

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.710 
studio lights or are in the studio make
sure<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.400> model<00:03:05.700> knows<00:03:05.910> where<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.210> be<00:03:06.510> or

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
sure the model knows where to be or

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.680 
sure the model knows where to be or
rather<00:03:07.380> where<00:03:08.100> she<00:03:08.340> needs<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.580> stay<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.390> that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
rather where she needs to stay so that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.210 
rather where she needs to stay so that
you<00:03:09.930> don't<00:03:10.110> end<00:03:10.260> up<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.620> her<00:03:10.770> off<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
you don't end up with her off the

for you depending upon the movement you

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.940 
for you depending upon the movement you
may<00:03:39.750> need<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.080> increase<00:03:40.380> your<00:03:40.440> shutter<00:03:40.860> speed

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950

motion blur isn't always a bad thing you

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.820 
motion blur isn't always a bad thing you
may<00:03:45.660> even<00:03:45.900> want<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.290> use<00:03:46.440> shutter<00:03:46.650> priority

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830
