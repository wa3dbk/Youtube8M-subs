00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
listeners and so if I called her she
comes<00:01:45.720> back<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> things<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.649> however

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
comes back and things like that however

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
comes back and things like that however
if<00:01:47.220> we're<00:01:47.399> running<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> times<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.350> she's

if we're running a lot of times if she's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
if we're running a lot of times if she's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
only long leash the problem is she gets

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.710 
only long leash the problem is she gets
some<00:01:52.680> momentum<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.000> 55

that longer leash is there and you have

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.309 
that longer leash is there and you have
got<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.009> slack<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.700> there's

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
got some slack on it there's

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.809

running room for her to get some

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.849 
running room for her to get some
momentum<00:02:13.939> built<00:02:14.540> up<00:02:14.749> and<00:02:14.989> then<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.499> just<00:02:15.650> will

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
momentum built up and then it just will

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.039 
momentum built up and then it just will
jerk<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.639> with<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> potential<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.599> possibly

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
jerk and with the potential of possibly

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.149 
jerk and with the potential of possibly
ripping<00:02:18.409> the<00:02:18.499> leash<00:02:18.650> right<00:02:18.829> out<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.040> your

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
ripping the leash right out of your

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:19.569 
ripping the leash right out of your
hands

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
hands

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.360 
hands
likewise<00:02:20.389> for<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.109> dog<00:02:21.439> think<00:02:21.980> about<00:02:22.189> it<00:02:22.280> from

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
likewise for the dog think about it from

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.670 
likewise for the dog think about it from
that<00:02:22.579> angle<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.239> dog<00:02:23.450> has<00:02:23.719> that<00:02:23.959> room<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.560> get

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
that angle the dog has that room to get

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.140 
that angle the dog has that room to get
the<00:02:24.769> momentum<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.219> in<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.639> really<00:02:25.939> going<00:02:26.060> to

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the momentum going in to really going to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300 
the momentum going in to really going to
tie<00:02:26.299> down<00:02:26.450> their<00:02:26.599> necks<00:02:26.749> so<00:02:27.019> Zee<00:02:27.650> doc<00:02:27.889> has<00:02:28.099> made

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
tie down their necks so Zee doc has made

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.490 
tie down their necks so Zee doc has made
a<00:02:28.519> much<00:02:28.819> shorter<00:02:29.359> leash<00:02:29.750> it's<00:02:30.019> only<00:02:30.139> about<00:02:30.290> two

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
a much shorter leash it's only about two

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.709 
a much shorter leash it's only about two
and<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> half<00:02:30.829> feet<00:02:31.040> three<00:02:31.340> feet<00:02:31.519> long<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.000> it

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
and a half feet three feet long and it

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.690 
and a half feet three feet long and it
really<00:02:32.750> keeps<00:02:33.590> them<00:02:33.920> from<00:02:34.069> getting<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
really keeps them from getting that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.459 
really keeps them from getting that
moment<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.299> built<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.689> but<00:02:35.870> still<00:02:36.139> gives<00:02:36.349> you

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:36.469 
moment to built up but still gives you

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.440 
moment to built up but still gives you
enough<00:02:36.680> room<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:37.099> keep<00:02:37.609> it<00:02:37.760> away<00:02:37.849> from<00:02:38.299> your

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
enough room to keep it away from your

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.300 
enough room to keep it away from your
body<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.840> little<00:02:39.019> bit<00:02:39.200> now<00:02:39.560> more<00:02:39.799> into<00:02:40.159> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
body a little bit now more into the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.520 
body a little bit now more into the
pulling<00:02:40.790> thing<00:02:41.120> one<00:02:41.719> of<00:02:41.749> the<00:02:41.840> coolest<00:02:42.319> parts

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
pulling thing one of the coolest parts

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.020 
pulling thing one of the coolest parts
about<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.950> leash<00:02:43.129> in<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.489> opinion<00:02:43.879> probably

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
about this leash in my opinion probably

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.599 
about this leash in my opinion probably
the<00:02:44.299> coolest<00:02:44.510> part<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:45.019> this<00:02:45.530> zigzag<00:02:45.919> part

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
the coolest part is this zigzag part

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.339 
the coolest part is this zigzag part
right<00:02:46.819> here<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.719> made<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:47.989> polyurethane

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
right here this is made of polyurethane

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.319 
right here this is made of polyurethane
plastic<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.250> what's<00:02:49.459> great<00:02:49.669> about<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.060> is

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
plastic and what's great about it is

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.030 
plastic and what's great about it is
that<00:02:50.659> it<00:02:50.810> serves<00:02:51.079> as<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.290> shock<00:02:51.620> absorbers

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
that it serves as a shock absorbers

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
that it serves as a shock absorbers
gonna<00:02:52.219> be<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.310> little<00:02:52.459> hard<00:02:52.760> for<00:02:52.790> me<00:02:52.939> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
gonna be a little hard for me to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.629 
gonna be a little hard for me to
demonstrate<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.750> when<00:02:54.439> there's<00:02:54.739> pull<00:02:55.129> on<00:02:55.459> it

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
demonstrate but when there's pull on it

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.539 
demonstrate but when there's pull on it
as<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.969> may<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.239> able<00:02:56.419> to<00:02:56.599> see<00:02:57.019> there<00:02:57.949> it

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
as you may be able to see there it

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.599 
as you may be able to see there it
extends<00:02:59.449> so<00:02:59.629> rather<00:02:59.870> than<00:03:00.230> when<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.010> dog<00:03:01.189> runs

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
extends so rather than when the dog runs

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.179 
extends so rather than when the dog runs
and<00:03:01.939> there<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.599> jerk<00:03:03.139> it's<00:03:03.650> not<00:03:03.889> quite<00:03:04.159> so

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 
and there is that jerk it's not quite so

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.849 
and there is that jerk it's not quite so
abrupt<00:03:04.819> as<00:03:05.000> like<00:03:05.629> if<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.049> were<00:03:06.139> just<00:03:06.409> this<00:03:06.590> part

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
abrupt as like if it were just this part

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.860 
abrupt as like if it were just this part
Alicia<00:03:07.099> would<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.579> be<00:03:07.699> stopping<00:03:08.299> it's<00:03:08.719> not

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
Alicia would just be stopping it's not

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.080 
Alicia would just be stopping it's not
so<00:03:09.079> abrupt<00:03:09.379> as<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:10.219> acts<00:03:10.519> like<00:03:10.639> a<00:03:10.760> nice

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
so abrupt as that this acts like a nice

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.179 
so abrupt as that this acts like a nice
kind<00:03:11.449> of<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.629> spring<00:03:12.079> a<00:03:12.230> shock<00:03:12.469> absorber<00:03:12.889> yes

really<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.440> mean<00:04:36.590> if<00:04:36.710> your<00:04:36.830> dog<00:04:36.980> goes<00:04:37.160> over<00:04:37.460> a

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
really I mean if your dog goes over a

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.250 
really I mean if your dog goes over a
cliff<00:04:37.820> unless<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.270> have<00:04:38.420> a<00:04:38.450> 600<00:04:38.960> pound<00:04:39.050> dog

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
cliff unless you have a 600 pound dog

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.750 
cliff unless you have a 600 pound dog
you're<00:04:39.500> probably<00:04:39.680> good<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:39.980> go<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.400> hold<00:04:40.640> them

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
you're probably good to go to hold them

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.520 
you're probably good to go to hold them
up<00:04:40.850> there<00:04:41.120> if<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.510> had<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.840> make<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> change<00:04:42.350> or

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
up there if I had to make a change or

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.050 
up there if I had to make a change or
addition<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.130> rough<00:04:43.280> leash<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.700> might<00:04:43.880> be

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
addition to the rough leash it might be

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.720 
addition to the rough leash it might be
that<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.270> would<00:04:44.600> have<00:04:44.870> some<00:04:45.500> length<00:04:46.010> choices

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
that I would have some length choices

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.180 
that I would have some length choices
because<00:04:47.120> if<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:47.810> have<00:04:48.140> a<00:04:48.170> larger<00:04:48.740> dog<00:04:48.920> which

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
because if you have a larger dog which

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.100 
because if you have a larger dog which
again<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:49.670> 55<00:04:50.240> pound<00:04:50.570> border<00:04:50.900> collie

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
again I have a 55 pound border collie

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.790 
again I have a 55 pound border collie
then<00:04:51.920> this<00:04:52.400> is<00:04:52.810> 29.5<00:04:53.810> inches<00:04:54.110> it's<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.440> little

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
then this is 29.5 inches it's a little

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800 
then this is 29.5 inches it's a little
bit<00:04:54.920> short<00:04:55.400> for<00:04:55.490> running<00:04:56.150> sometimes<00:04:56.600> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
bit short for running sometimes the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.330 
bit short for running sometimes the
reason<00:04:57.140> is<00:04:57.260> shortage<00:04:57.560> specifically<00:04:58.160> for

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
reason is shortage specifically for

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.490 
reason is shortage specifically for
running<00:04:58.610> is<00:04:58.730> because<00:04:59.420> the<00:04:59.540> runners<00:04:59.900> leg<00:05:00.230> is

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
running is because the runners leg is

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.010 
running is because the runners leg is
going<00:05:00.680> out<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.250> front<00:05:01.610> probably<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.540> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
going out in front probably and the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.050 
going out in front probably and the
dog's<00:05:03.230> legs<00:05:03.590> are<00:05:03.770> going<00:05:03.890> quite<00:05:04.460> far<00:05:04.640> behind<00:05:04.790> so

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
dog's legs are going quite far behind so

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.210 
dog's legs are going quite far behind so
if<00:05:05.120> you've<00:05:05.240> only<00:05:05.330> got<00:05:05.480> 29.5<00:05:06.470> inches<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:06.950> a<00:05:07.010> dog

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
if you've only got 29.5 inches in a dog

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.450 
if you've only got 29.5 inches in a dog
whose<00:05:07.580> body<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:08.590> 29.5<00:05:09.590> inches<00:05:09.920> let's<00:05:10.130> just<00:05:10.340> say

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
whose body is 29.5 inches let's just say

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520 
whose body is 29.5 inches let's just say
long<00:05:10.760> then<00:05:11.450> you're<00:05:11.570> gonna<00:05:11.660> wind<00:05:11.960> up<00:05:12.110> with<00:05:12.170> a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
long then you're gonna wind up with a

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.560 
long then you're gonna wind up with a
couple<00:05:12.950> of<00:05:13.010> collisions<00:05:13.340> if<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.940> dog<00:05:14.120> runs<00:05:14.420> in

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
couple of collisions if the dog runs in

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.510 
couple of collisions if the dog runs in
front<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:14.990> versus<00:05:15.380> on<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.650> side<00:05:15.860> not<00:05:16.490> a

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
front of you versus on the side not a

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.980 
front of you versus on the side not a
big<00:05:16.700> deal<00:05:16.850> for<00:05:16.880> me<00:05:17.150> Sadie<00:05:17.450> listen<00:05:17.780> very<00:05:17.900> well

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
big deal for me Sadie listen very well

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.840 
big deal for me Sadie listen very well
rein<00:05:18.380> on<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.620> side<00:05:18.830> but<00:05:19.310> there<00:05:19.580> were<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.730> couple

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
rein on the side but there were a couple

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.460 
rein on the side but there were a couple
of<00:05:20.150> collisions<00:05:20.390> where<00:05:20.690> she<00:05:20.840> would<00:05:20.990> cross<00:05:21.230> in

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
of collisions where she would cross in

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.110 
of collisions where she would cross in
front<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.800> me<00:05:21.860> where<00:05:22.340> we<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.670> kind<00:05:22.850> of<00:05:22.910> had<00:05:23.030> to

be careful she tripped a little bit not
a<00:05:24.950> huge<00:05:25.340> deal<00:05:25.640> but<00:05:26.210> it's<00:05:26.710> absolutely

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
a huge deal but it's absolutely
