00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.190
 choose two shades of brown one medium and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.460
 a darker 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.770
 also use an illuminating shadow start 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.379
 the brown shade lighter by 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.589
 the entire movable eyelid rising a little 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:12.090
 so in his people he tied them also 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 darker and disappeared counted in the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 that pulled a little too 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.759
 out was in a beak is well this my eyelashes 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.590
 lower in the outer corner the shadow 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.049
 illuminator to bring light to the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:41.310
 region below the eyebrows and also 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:43.740
 in the inner corner of the eyes to highlight 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.630
 even the eyes use a pencil or 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.780
 black eyeliner close to eyelashes 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.210
 top with mask and ready 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.210
 You look beautiful, you say brown smoke. 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.500
 Oh and if you do not know where your 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.570
 concave 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.590
 find the hole between the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.590
 bone and eyeball 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.769
 today who is here with me to beat a 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.910
 answer the questions is the colony 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.849
 constancy fernandez and simon who is 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.260
 here again, and today the subject is 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.420
 smoked brown 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.330
 I want to know this makeup of the day. 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.330
 where this basic makeup is because 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.220
 never what I know how to do 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.569
 I hope I think my skin tone will 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.970
 Which is better because I like a year. 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.080
 marked but I do not have much 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.110
 experience to do something like this 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.450
 but a black brown symbol that I think 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.030
 that he is classic does not have a car to 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.310
 any environment and how I said what I 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.500
 I know how to do it, and you usually mix it up. 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.660
 with body do not hesitate make-up pleasure 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.349
 with a blusher more marked one more mouth 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.450
 marked knew too today I do but so with 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.400
 moderation I put a brown more 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.739
 light one puts a red lipstick but 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.380
 very dark and with a mouth but not yet 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.630
 I dare phone we come 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.209
 answer the questions of the readers 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.780
 was the first one to judge the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.290
 my called a clothes leave the special 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.239
 that you would say you would do file 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.549
 I think I 'll put a little black on the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.519
 corner of the eyes paid a 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.290
 Greater dramaticity is actually the eye 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.900
 When you add brown it gets more 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.510
 is more intense and is a good 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.389
 tip to make the brown of the diurnal 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.280
 A new promoter is not a fast thing. 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.920
 that you may be with a brown is 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.500
 during the day and then use the same 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.200
 Makeup for the night just by adding the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.389
 little black dress in the corner and is a good tip 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.690
 also for you who have more eyes 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.849
 together you adding that little black 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.700
 outside you and for children in the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.099
 they separate the eyes and became very 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.940
 I think it's a nice touch that 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.550
 I would give in my late is brown basic is 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.340
 add a brightness point 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.650
 maybe then you make the basis of the estimated 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.500
 matic is always that I always think 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.260
 stay more is cooler and uses a shadow 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.240
 with brightness above this light in the 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.430
 foam already have a differentiated from 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.440
 maine where xodÃ³ de canto in the olympic not 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.150
 It may be in the interim that I stay there 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.010
 of course the more you shine 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.470
 add more night makeup stays 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.840
 Tony has more shame to do 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.800
 brown and dark or 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.530
 friends 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.770
 It's a pretty question, why come? 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.650
 you do with the brown off 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.390
 practically will not appear then the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.820
 my tip is you use it just 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.280
 a shimmering shadows shoulders with 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.680
 brightness then you will wear a sparkling 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.130
 the brown with brilliance that looks wonderful 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.930
 in black skins on skins is darker 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.820
 so you're going to make a call using 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.880
 this type of sum and you can mix 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.380
 for example with gold or put 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.540
 Reminds me of a wonderful rosÃ© boyfriend. 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.700
 Pearly all these are colors that is what 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.450
 that look great black skin I think 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.490
 looks beautiful 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.890
 he does not have a question about a lot 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.790
 of Asian and Japanese friends have 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.740
 majority 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.480
 and she always asks me how they go 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.640
 make up the eyes because they do not have 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.200
 this wine color to mark the concave 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:26.320
 nÃ© everton cool is usually the 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.270
 oriental has the most eyelid eyelid 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.730
 But that's not why they do not let 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.180
 to have with which it has the conca you 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:37.090
 the eastern palpate in here the end of 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.030
 eyeball to this space between the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.250
 eyeball and the bone is the concave 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.490
 go get a smoking brush and go 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.830
 start marking where this would be 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.160
 that the eastern ones do not 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.200
 have to talk to her and you can 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.810
 also speak to her if she still 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.360
 not find the concave to measure more or 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.660
 the distance between the lashes and the 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.860
