00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.959 
to show the defeat and myself to break
the<00:00:51.300> limit<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> energy<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.850> their

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the limit so I use the energy in their

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.790 
the limit so I use the energy in their
box<00:00:54.210> set<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.079> step<00:00:55.320> above<00:00:55.559> them
