00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.660 
different from the original one they're
taking<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.950> more<00:01:21.049> subtle<00:01:22.049> approach<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
taking a more subtle approach to it so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.819 
taking a more subtle approach to it so
let's<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.750> ahead<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> hit<00:01:25.860> play

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
let's just go ahead here and hit play

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
let's just go ahead here and hit play
all<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:30.020> okay<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> game

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
all right okay so here we're in the game

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.370 
all right okay so here we're in the game
of<00:01:33.869> course<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.270> now<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.869> kind<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> hard<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
of course and now it's kind of hard to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
of course and now it's kind of hard to
explain<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.070> never<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.820> leave<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659

game<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.409> many<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> gore<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.299> just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
game and many of gore one you would just

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.679 
game and many of gore one you would just
um<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.700> die<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.570> you

from<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.980> first<00:02:35.310> one<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.329> course<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
from the first one now of course you

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.420 
from the first one now of course you
move<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.139> shoot<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.409> same<00:02:37.620> way<00:02:37.769> here<00:02:38.040> we<00:02:38.159> are

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
move and shoot the same way here we are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.000 
move and shoot the same way here we are
in<00:02:38.730> auto<00:02:39.060> aim<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.870> at<00:02:40.469> the<00:02:40.590> bottom<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.950> can

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
in auto aim and at the bottom you can

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.089 
in auto aim and at the bottom you can
see<00:02:41.129> that<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.389> machine<00:02:42.810> gun<00:02:43.049> does<00:02:43.379> run<00:02:43.650> out<00:02:43.799> so

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
see that the machine gun does run out so

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.740

here<00:02:44.730> I'm<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:44.879> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.150> waste<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.480> ammo

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
here I'm just going to waste the ammo

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.729 
here I'm just going to waste the ammo
and<00:02:47.419> then<00:02:48.419> once<00:02:48.689> you<00:02:48.840> waste<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> ammo<00:02:49.409> you

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
and then once you waste the ammo you

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.699 
and then once you waste the ammo you
revert<00:02:50.069> back<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:51.540> axe<00:02:51.870> which<00:02:52.500> has

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
revert back to this axe which has

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.729 
revert back to this axe which has
stamina<00:02:53.040> which<00:02:53.459> never<00:02:53.730> really<00:02:54.030> runs<00:02:54.269> out<00:02:54.739> but

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
just look very nice especially if you

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.309 
just look very nice especially if you
have<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.579> Retina<00:03:35.879> display<00:03:36.419> device<00:03:36.780> or

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
have a Retina display device or

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.229 
have a Retina display device or
something<00:03:37.829> like<00:03:37.919> gap<00:03:38.129> 15<00:03:38.489> or<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:38.760> new<00:03:38.879> ipod

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
something like gap 15 or the new ipod

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.780 
something like gap 15 or the new ipod
touch<00:03:39.889> because<00:03:40.889> it<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.159> takes<00:03:41.400> advantage

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
touch because it really takes advantage

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.280 
touch because it really takes advantage
of<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.030> new<00:03:42.720> 5-inch<00:03:43.349> screen<00:03:43.760> 4-inch<00:03:44.760> screen

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
of the new 5-inch screen 4-inch screen

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.649 
of the new 5-inch screen 4-inch screen
5-inch<00:03:46.290> screen<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:48.060> yeah<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.419> it<00:03:48.510> basically

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
5-inch screen and yeah so it basically

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.490 
5-inch screen and yeah so it basically
takes<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.430> same<00:03:50.430> approach<00:03:51.209> I'm<00:03:52.169> just<00:03:52.290> showing

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
takes the same approach I'm just showing

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.920 
takes the same approach I'm just showing
you<00:03:52.620> here<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:52.949> you<00:03:52.979> can<00:03:53.159> see<00:03:53.310> how<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.930> now

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you here so you can see how it is now

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.530 
you here so you can see how it is now

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
to beat because he's pretty strong I

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.310 
to beat because he's pretty strong I
mean<00:06:24.210> it's<00:06:24.390> better<00:06:24.539> to<00:06:24.719> get<00:06:24.870> them<00:06:24.990> from<00:06:25.080> far

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
mean it's better to get them from far

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.649 
mean it's better to get them from far
away<00:06:25.820> but<00:06:26.820> each<00:06:27.060> one<00:06:27.090> has<00:06:27.390> their<00:06:27.419> own<00:06:27.570> unique

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659 
away but each one has their own unique

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.480 
away but each one has their own unique
bosses<00:06:28.380> I<00:06:28.469> mention<00:06:28.860> it<00:06:28.950> it's<00:06:29.099> really<00:06:29.310> cool

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
bosses I mention it it's really cool

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.180 
bosses I mention it it's really cool
because<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:32.430> makes<00:06:32.669> every<00:06:33.120> level<00:06:34.190> worth

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
because it makes every level worth

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.089 
because it makes every level worth
playing<00:06:35.640> and<00:06:36.530> so<00:06:37.530> you<00:06:37.620> can<00:06:37.770> get<00:06:37.860> more<00:06:37.919> money

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099
