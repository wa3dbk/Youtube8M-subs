00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.550 
there fluorocarbon with a wire tip and
and<00:02:05.299> I'll<00:02:05.450> put<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> little<00:02:05.840> circle<00:02:06.020> hook<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.470> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
and I'll put a little circle hook on the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.319 
and I'll put a little circle hook on the
nose<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.310> I'll<00:02:07.430> hook<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.670> mullet<00:02:08.209> right

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
nose and I'll hook that mullet right

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.389 
nose and I'll hook that mullet right
through<00:02:08.509> its<00:02:08.630> eyes<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.350> will<00:02:10.009> be<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
through its eyes and this will be the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.190 
through its eyes and this will be the
float<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.790> it'll<00:02:11.000> keep<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.269> 3<00:02:11.570> or<00:02:11.600> 4<00:02:11.720> feet<00:02:12.019> down

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
float and it'll keep it 3 or 4 feet down

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.319 
float and it'll keep it 3 or 4 feet down
but<00:02:12.920> sometimes<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.459> I'm<00:02:13.579> old<00:02:13.730> gets<00:02:13.970> weird

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
but sometimes if I'm old gets weird

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.640 
but sometimes if I'm old gets weird
it'll<00:02:14.540> come<00:02:14.690> right<00:02:14.720> up<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.079> the<00:02:15.170> top<00:02:15.350> because

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
it'll come right up to the top because

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.500 
it'll come right up to the top because
it's<00:02:15.799> trying<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.160> find<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.400> way<00:02:16.549> out<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.209> top

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
it's trying to find a way out that top

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's trying to find a way out that top
is<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> funnel<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.320> just<00:02:18.530> cuts<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:18.890> off<00:02:19.010> you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
is the funnel it just cuts it off you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.830 
is the funnel it just cuts it off you
can't<00:02:19.579> go<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.000> know<00:02:20.120> mullet<00:02:20.420> can't<00:02:20.630> swim

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
can't go and you know mullet can't swim

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.470 
can't go and you know mullet can't swim
in<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.380> air<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.160> cuts<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.030> off<00:02:23.120> right<00:02:23.269> there

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
in the air so it cuts it off right there

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.000 
in the air so it cuts it off right there
and<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:23.690> when<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> smash<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.739> really

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and that's when I smash it it's really

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.040 
and that's when I smash it it's really
cool<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.940> float<00:02:26.180> keeps<00:02:26.450> it<00:02:26.599> lit<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.900> it

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
cool and that float keeps it lit up it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.330 
cool and that float keeps it lit up it
keeps<00:02:27.230> me<00:02:27.379> seeing<00:02:27.620> what's<00:02:27.830> going<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.160> out

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
keeps me seeing what's going on out

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.740 
keeps me seeing what's going on out
there<00:02:28.370> because<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.030> lot<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.239> times<00:02:29.480> when<00:02:29.660> you're

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
there because a lot of times when you're

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.000 
there because a lot of times when you're
just<00:02:29.840> let<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.140> drift<00:02:30.319> with<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.470> tide

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
just let it drift with the tide

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.589 
just let it drift with the tide
that<00:02:31.310> line<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.640> gonna<00:02:31.730> get<00:02:31.909> slack<00:02:32.269> you're<00:02:32.480> not

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
that line is gonna get slack you're not

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.330 
that line is gonna get slack you're not
gonna<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:32.870> gonna<00:02:33.019> know<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:34.129> course

gonna really gonna know and of course

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.369 
gonna really gonna know and of course
popping<00:02:34.730> coursework<00:02:35.150> all<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.390> time<00:02:35.599> but<00:02:35.959> not

popping coursework all the time but not
in<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:37.340> night<00:02:37.519> because<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.209> can't<00:02:38.390> see<00:02:38.540> that

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
in the night because you can't see that

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.509 
in the night because you can't see that
popping<00:02:38.959> cord<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.739> thing<00:02:39.950> holds<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.310> ammo

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
popping cord this thing holds up ammo

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.490 
popping cord this thing holds up ammo
perfectly<00:02:41.120> it'll<00:02:41.329> hold<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.659> here<00:02:41.840> minnows<00:02:42.409> for
