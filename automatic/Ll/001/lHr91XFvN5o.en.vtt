so<00:00:00.210> Brendan<00:00:00.989> you<00:00:01.110> know<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:03.500> there<00:00:04.500> are

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
so Brendan you know that there are

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.070 
so Brendan you know that there are
patients<00:00:05.190> who<00:00:05.430> have<00:00:05.460> acromegaly<00:00:06.359> starting<00:00:06.960> in

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
patients who have acromegaly starting in

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.100 
patients who have acromegaly starting in
an<00:00:07.170> early<00:00:07.410> age<00:00:07.580> and<00:00:08.660> in<00:00:09.660> some<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.990> these

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
an early age and in some of these

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.660 
an early age and in some of these
patients<00:00:10.410> they<00:00:10.769> even<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.160> family<00:00:11.340> members

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
patients they even have family members

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.350 
patients they even have family members
who<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.750> similar<00:00:12.990> conditions<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.360> there

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
who have similar conditions and there

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
who have similar conditions and there
was<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.780> research<00:00:15.960> regarding<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
was some research regarding this in the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.970 
was some research regarding this in the
last<00:00:17.670> couple<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.029> years<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:19.500> recognize

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
last couple of years and we recognize

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.769 
last couple of years and we recognize
the<00:00:20.189> number<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.550> families<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.420> similar

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the number of families with similar

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.590 
the number of families with similar
disease<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.670> there<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> gene<00:00:24.150> which<00:00:24.570> has

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
disease and there is a gene which has

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.099 
disease and there is a gene which has
been<00:00:24.990> identified<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> these

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
been identified in some of these

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.169 
been identified in some of these
families<00:00:28.590> having<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> change<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:29.789> an<00:00:29.910> earlier

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
families having a change or an earlier

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.400 
families having a change or an earlier
mutation<00:00:30.949> which<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.189> cause<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> disease<00:00:33.410> so

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
mutation which can cause the disease so

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.920 
mutation which can cause the disease so
as<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.250> discussed<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.790> before<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.390> wanted<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
as we discussed this before we wanted to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.639 
as we discussed this before we wanted to
check<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.989> we<00:00:39.989> had<00:00:40.410> your

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
check you for this and we had your

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.850 
check you for this and we had your
sample<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.570> had<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.020> test<00:00:43.230> done<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.530> we

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
sample and we had the test done and we

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
sample and we had the test done and we
found<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.370> change<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.090> gene<00:00:45.360> called<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
found the change in this gene called a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.299 
found the change in this gene called a
type<00:00:46.289> II<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:48.960> think<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.950> change

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
type II and we think that this change

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.540 
type II and we think that this change
gives<00:00:51.469> people<00:00:52.469> who<00:00:52.649> carried<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.070> change<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
gives people who carried this change of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
gives people who carried this change of
predisposition<00:00:53.840> to<00:00:54.840> develop<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> pituitary

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
predisposition to develop a pituitary

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.130 
predisposition to develop a pituitary
tumor<00:00:55.860> role<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.480> case<00:00:57.570> indeed

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
tumor role which in your case indeed

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.360 
tumor role which in your case indeed
happened

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
happened

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
happened
and<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.850> wonder<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.539> anybody<00:01:00.960> else<00:01:01.140> in

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and I wonder if you know anybody else in

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.709 
and I wonder if you know anybody else in
your<00:01:01.379> family<00:01:01.710> has<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> similar<00:01:02.579> condition<00:01:03.120> yes

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
your family has a similar condition yes

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.310 
your family has a similar condition yes
I<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> distant<00:01:05.040> cousin<00:01:05.840> who<00:01:06.840> suffers<00:01:07.200> from
