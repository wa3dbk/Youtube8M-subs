and then we're going to hit s and then Y

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880 
and then we're going to hit s and then Y
and<00:01:33.090> that'll<00:01:33.840> let<00:01:33.960> us<00:01:34.200> move<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and that'll let us move them on the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
and that'll let us move them on the
y-axis<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> brings<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
y-axis and as you can see this brings in

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.770 
y-axis and as you can see this brings in
the<00:01:37.470> two<00:01:37.650> sides<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.880> make<00:01:39.030> sort<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> rooftop

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the two sides to make sort of a rooftop

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
the two sides to make sort of a rooftop
point<00:01:40.250> move<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.030> the

point move it up a little bit on the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.929 
point move it up a little bit on the
z-axis<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> very<00:01:44.490> simple

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
z-axis and now we have a very simple

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
z-axis and now we have a very simple
shape<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.659> house<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.110> roof<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> next<00:01:49.350> we're

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
shape of a house in a roof so next we're

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
shape of a house in a roof so next we're
going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.829> take<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> house<00:01:50.700> while<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:50.970> still

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
going to take the house while it's still

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.770 
going to take the house while it's still
in<00:01:51.329> edit<00:01:51.509> mode

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.960 

and<00:01:58.410> we're<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.650> subdivide<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.400> house<00:01:59.580> and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
and we're gonna subdivide the house and

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.840 
and we're gonna subdivide the house and
this<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.560> resets<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.370> something

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
this way we can get resets for something

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.680 
this way we can get resets for something
like<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.060> door<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.840> window<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> we're<00:02:06.600> gonna

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
like a door or a window and we're gonna

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.450 
like a door or a window and we're gonna
hold<00:02:06.870> and<00:02:07.020> shift<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.560> select<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
hold and shift and just select all of

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.940 
hold and shift and just select all of
these<00:02:08.640> lines<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:10.170> get<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.410> entire<00:02:10.649> wall

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
these lines so we get the entire wall

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.850 
these lines so we get the entire wall
and<00:02:11.190> push<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.580> over<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.910> y-axis<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.860> then

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and push it over on the y-axis and then

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
and push it over on the y-axis and then
we're<00:02:13.980> gonna<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> same<00:02:14.520> with<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.180> other

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
we're gonna be the same with the other

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.860 
we're gonna be the same with the other
side<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:16.110> lines<00:02:16.820> holding<00:02:17.820> shifts<00:02:18.450> lecturing

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
side of lines holding shifts lecturing

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.270 
side of lines holding shifts lecturing
all<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.110> them<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.470> then<00:02:19.560> pushing<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.980> over<00:02:20.070> on

all of them and then pushing it over on

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.699 
all of them and then pushing it over on
the<00:02:20.340> y-axis<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:21.930> sort<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.410> door

again doing this really helps with

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.440 
again doing this really helps with
larger<00:03:01.920> projects<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.090> we're<00:03:03.209> going<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> go

larger projects and we're going to go

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.670 
larger projects and we're going to go
over<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.019> we're<00:03:04.110> gonna<00:03:04.170> do<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.620> thing

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
over and we're gonna do the same thing

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.070 
over and we're gonna do the same thing
into<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.070> window<00:03:05.510> once<00:03:06.510> again<00:03:06.690> holding<00:03:06.959> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
we're going to assign our grouping to it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:28.730 
we're going to assign our grouping to it
and<00:03:15.269> those<00:03:15.390> will<00:03:15.600> be<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.720> front<00:03:15.930> window

house<00:03:40.350> paint<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:41.430> I'm<00:03:41.730> gonna<00:03:41.820> make<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.180> sort

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
house paint and I'm gonna make it sort

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.280 
house paint and I'm gonna make it sort
of<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.750> sandy<00:03:43.230> brownish<00:03:43.920> color<00:03:44.990> you<00:03:45.990> can<00:03:46.170> make

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
of a sandy brownish color you can make

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.470 
of a sandy brownish color you can make
whatever<00:03:46.560> color<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.010> feel<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.460> and<00:03:48.330> we're

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
whatever color you feel like and we're

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.670 
whatever color you feel like and we're
going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.630> take<00:03:48.750> down<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:48.990> specular<00:03:49.530> color

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
going to take down the specular color

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.620 
going to take down the specular color
what<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.130> does<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.850> makes<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
what that does is it makes it so it's

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.780 
what that does is it makes it so it's
less<00:03:51.810> reflective<00:03:52.230> more<00:03:53.190> like<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.340> house<00:03:53.490> paint

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
less reflective more like a house paint

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
less reflective more like a house paint
should<00:03:54.030> be<00:03:54.210> not<00:03:54.900> very<00:03:55.170> shiny

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.089 

and<00:04:05.810> now<00:04:06.109> we're<00:04:06.230> just<00:04:06.260> gonna<00:04:06.439> make<00:04:06.620> our<00:04:06.829> roof

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
and now we're just gonna make our roof

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.030 
and now we're just gonna make our roof
material<00:04:07.719> and<00:04:08.719> we're<00:04:08.930> gonna<00:04:09.049> make<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.319> red

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
material and we're gonna make a red

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:19.840 
material and we're gonna make a red
colored<00:04:10.609> roof<00:04:10.819> reddish-orange

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.150 

now<00:04:20.420> that<00:04:20.540> we<00:04:20.630> have<00:04:20.840> material<00:04:21.620> assigned<00:04:21.920> to

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
now that we have material assigned to

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.050 
now that we have material assigned to
both<00:04:22.310> our<00:04:22.580> roof<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:23.780> our<00:04:24.610> building<00:04:25.610> let's

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
both our roof and our building let's

our group selection tool and find our

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.160 
our group selection tool and find our
window<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:07.730> now<00:05:08.510> we're<00:05:08.660> going<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.810> make<00:05:08.990> our

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
window and now we're going to make our

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.760 
window and now we're going to make our
window<00:05:09.530> material<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.990> dark<00:05:15.200> shade<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.470> blue

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
window material and a dark shade of blue

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.280 
window material and a dark shade of blue
blueish<00:05:16.310> green<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.790> usually<00:05:17.120> best<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.540> use<00:05:17.780> for

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
blueish green is usually best to use for

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:29.790 
blueish green is usually best to use for
windows

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.520 

and<00:05:30.639> we're<00:05:30.729> gonna<00:05:30.849> go<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.120> mirror<00:05:31.449> and<00:05:31.720> turn

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
and we're gonna go to a mirror and turn

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.129 
and we're gonna go to a mirror and turn
on<00:05:32.710> reflectivity<00:05:33.280> and<00:05:33.759> boost<00:05:34.660> it<00:05:34.810> up<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.050> about

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
on reflectivity and boost it up to about

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.990 
on reflectivity and boost it up to about
a<00:05:35.319> point<00:05:35.949> three<00:05:36.569> you<00:05:37.569> can<00:05:37.690> go<00:05:37.870> higher<00:05:38.169> or<00:05:38.560> lower

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
a point three you can go higher or lower

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.969 
a point three you can go higher or lower
just<00:05:40.000> depends<00:05:40.300> on<00:05:40.389> how<00:05:40.509> you<00:05:40.569> want<00:05:40.720> your<00:05:41.110> window

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
just depends on how you want your window

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.460 
just depends on how you want your window
to<00:05:42.069> look<00:05:42.250> when<00:05:42.400> it's<00:05:42.520> all<00:05:42.639> done<00:05:42.849> and<00:05:43.449> for<00:05:44.380> the

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
to look when it's all done and for the

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.689 
to look when it's all done and for the
most<00:05:44.590> part<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.979> won't<00:05:45.039> really<00:05:45.220> see<00:05:45.430> too<00:05:45.610> much

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
most part you won't really see too much

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:47.219 
most part you won't really see too much
reflecting<00:05:46.240> in<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.419> since<00:05:46.630> we're<00:05:46.840> pretty<00:05:47.110> much

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
reflecting in it since we're pretty much

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:55.219 
reflecting in it since we're pretty much
gonna<00:05:47.440> make<00:05:47.710> just<00:05:48.280> a<00:05:48.400> house

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.770 

okay<00:05:56.229> now<00:05:56.409> that<00:05:56.560> we<00:05:56.650> have<00:05:56.830> a<00:05:57.159> door<00:05:58.150> and<00:05:58.659> a

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
okay now that we have a door and a

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.749 
okay now that we have a door and a
window<00:05:58.810> let's<00:05:59.770> move<00:05:59.949> our<00:06:00.069> camera<00:06:00.400> over<00:06:00.639> and

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
window let's move our camera over and

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.249 
window let's move our camera over and
we're<00:06:00.849> gonna<00:06:00.909> try<00:06:01.389> to<00:06:01.419> render<00:06:01.689> this<00:06:01.870> out<00:06:02.080> and

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
we're gonna try to render this out and

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:10.320 
we're gonna try to render this out and
see<00:06:03.219> what<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.400> looks<00:06:03.520> like<00:06:04.409> hit<00:06:05.409> f12

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330
