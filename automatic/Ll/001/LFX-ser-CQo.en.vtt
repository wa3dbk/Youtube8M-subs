00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
every time that we look out this window

every time that we look out this window
or<00:00:31.189> we<00:00:31.460> look<00:00:31.640> out<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.910> windows<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.210> the

or we look out the windows and the
cupola<00:00:32.750> we're<00:00:33.230> absolutely<00:00:33.410> amazed<00:00:34.010> and<00:00:34.370> and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
cupola we're absolutely amazed and and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.790 
cupola we're absolutely amazed and and
the<00:00:35.629> same<00:00:35.780> thing<00:00:35.840> goes<00:00:35.989> for<00:00:36.140> being<00:00:36.440> on<00:00:36.530> board<00:00:36.680> a

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
the same thing goes for being on board a

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.729 
the same thing goes for being on board a
space<00:00:37.010> shuttle<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.520> i<00:00:38.390> would<00:00:39.140> say<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:39.559> two

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
space shuttle and i would say that two

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.439 
space shuttle and i would say that two
nights<00:00:39.920> ago<00:00:40.129> I<00:00:40.309> probably<00:00:40.730> saw<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.210> most

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
nights ago I probably saw the most

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.180 
nights ago I probably saw the most
amazing<00:00:41.600> thing<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.230> have<00:00:42.260> ever<00:00:42.470> seen<00:00:42.770> in<00:00:42.829> space

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
amazing thing I have ever seen in space

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.979 
amazing thing I have ever seen in space
and<00:00:43.460> that's<00:00:44.030> saying<00:00:44.239> an<00:00:44.329> awful<00:00:44.570> lot<00:00:44.660> because

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
and that's saying an awful lot because

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.600 
and that's saying an awful lot because
every<00:00:45.260> day<00:00:45.410> is<00:00:45.559> filled<00:00:45.739> with<00:00:45.920> amazing<00:00:46.220> things

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
every day is filled with amazing things

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.280 
every day is filled with amazing things
and<00:00:46.850> that<00:00:47.390> was<00:00:47.570> we<00:00:47.750> were<00:00:47.839> flying<00:00:48.080> over

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
and that was we were flying over

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.470 
and that was we were flying over
Tasmania<00:00:49.010> we<00:00:49.309> had<00:00:49.400> actually<00:00:49.550> just<00:00:49.790> seen<00:00:50.330> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
Tasmania we had actually just seen the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.270 
Tasmania we had actually just seen the
storms<00:00:50.870> in<00:00:51.080> the<00:00:51.199> South<00:00:51.379> Pacific<00:00:51.589> over<00:00:52.190> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
Philippines and it was nighttime

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.590 
Philippines and it was nighttime
thunderstorms<00:00:55.550> lighting<00:00:55.879> up<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.089> entire<00:00:56.300> sky

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
thunderstorms lighting up the entire sky

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.990 
thunderstorms lighting up the entire sky
and<00:00:56.900> then<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:57.860> before<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.220> Sun<00:00:58.430> came<00:00:58.610> up<00:00:58.670> the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
and then just before the Sun came up the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.610 
and then just before the Sun came up the
earth<00:00:59.120> slim<00:00:59.390> was<00:00:59.659> you<00:00:59.900> know<00:01:00.019> lit<00:01:00.260> up<00:01:00.409> as<00:01:00.589> a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
earth slim was you know lit up as a

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.060 
earth slim was you know lit up as a
sliver<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.340> blue<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.750> purple<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.620> then

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
sliver of blue and in purple and then

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.590 
sliver of blue and in purple and then
there<00:01:04.220> was<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:04.460> long<00:01:04.759> green<00:01:05.180> arc<00:01:05.390> that

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
there was this long green arc that

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.630 
there was this long green arc that
extended<00:01:06.110> probably<00:01:06.619> 10<00:01:06.830> degrees<00:01:07.130> or<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:07.460> from

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
extended probably 10 degrees or so from

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.029 
extended probably 10 degrees or so from
the<00:01:07.789> horizon<00:01:08.440> actually<00:01:09.440> from<00:01:09.950> the

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
the horizon actually from the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.980 
the horizon actually from the
perspective<00:01:10.550> of<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.700> cupola<00:01:11.210> which<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.840> which

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
perspective of the cupola which in which

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.440 
perspective of the cupola which in which
case<00:01:12.200> were<00:01:12.380> upside<00:01:12.740> down<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.250> up<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:14.180> know<00:01:14.270> in

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
case were upside down up up you know in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.999 
case were upside down up up you know in
my<00:01:14.570> field<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:14.960> view<00:01:15.080> upwards<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.680> fact<00:01:15.860> it

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
my field of view upwards in fact it

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.249 
my field of view upwards in fact it
disappeared<00:01:16.490> behind<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.940> gym<00:01:17.180> at<00:01:17.660> least<00:01:18.020> 10

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
disappeared behind the gym at least 10

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.490 
disappeared behind the gym at least 10
degrees<00:01:18.560> i<00:01:18.770> think<00:01:19.039> twenty<00:01:19.640> earth<00:01:20.030> 20<00:01:20.780> moon

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
degrees i think twenty earth 20 moon

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.200 
degrees i think twenty earth 20 moon
diameters<00:01:22.190> if<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.520> think<00:01:22.789> about<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.179> those

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
diameters if you think about it in those

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.510 
diameters if you think about it in those
terms<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.840> i<00:01:24.229> had<00:01:24.350> no<00:01:24.380> idea<00:01:24.830> what<00:01:24.979> it<00:01:25.009> was<00:01:25.190> was

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
terms and i had no idea what it was was

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.300 
terms and i had no idea what it was was
a<00:01:25.550> long<00:01:25.789> green<00:01:26.210> glowing<00:01:26.570> arc<00:01:26.899> and<00:01:27.100> turns<00:01:28.100> out

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
a long green glowing arc and turns out

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.130 
a long green glowing arc and turns out
it<00:01:28.490> end<00:01:28.640> up<00:01:28.789> being<00:01:28.820> ended<00:01:29.270> up<00:01:29.390> being<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.690> comet

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
it end up being ended up being a comet

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.139 
it end up being ended up being a comet
that<00:01:30.380> somebody<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.100> Tasmania<00:01:31.670> had<00:01:31.759> seen<00:01:31.970> about

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
that somebody in Tasmania had seen about

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.480 
that somebody in Tasmania had seen about
the<00:01:32.300> same<00:01:32.539> time<00:01:32.570> Comet<00:01:33.200> Lovejoy<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:34.340> had

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the same time Comet Lovejoy that had

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.969 
the same time Comet Lovejoy that had
passed<00:01:34.670> about<00:01:35.229> 140,000<00:01:36.229> kilometres<00:01:36.319> from<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
passed about 140,000 kilometres from the

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.400 
passed about 140,000 kilometres from the
surface<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:37.459> the<00:01:37.550> Sun<00:01:38.030> when<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:38.780> disappeared

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
surface of the Sun when it disappeared

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.930 
surface of the Sun when it disappeared
behind<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.770> Sun<00:01:40.009> I<00:01:40.220> think<00:01:40.459> astronomers

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
behind the Sun I think astronomers

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.460 
behind the Sun I think astronomers
thought<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.420> would<00:01:41.569> not<00:01:41.750> appear<00:01:42.080> again<00:01:42.319> it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
thought it would not appear again it

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.290 
thought it would not appear again it
probably<00:01:42.740> would<00:01:42.860> burn<00:01:43.039> up<00:01:43.220> but<00:01:43.819> it's<00:01:43.970> probably

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
probably would burn up but it's probably

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.940 
probably would burn up but it's probably
the<00:01:44.569> most<00:01:44.720> spectacular<00:01:45.050> thing<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.800> can

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the most spectacular thing you can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.320 
the most spectacular thing you can
imagine<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.520> from<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.759> vantage<00:01:46.940> point<00:01:47.060> of

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
imagine and from the vantage point of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.719 
imagine and from the vantage point of
space<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:48.410> different<00:01:48.890> than<00:01:49.069> seeing<00:01:49.369> it<00:01:49.520> from

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
space it's different than seeing it from

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.040 
space it's different than seeing it from
Planet<00:01:50.119> Earth<00:01:50.209> because<00:01:50.660> there's<00:01:50.869> no

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
Planet Earth because there's no

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.440 
Planet Earth because there's no
intervening<00:01:51.410> atmosphere<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.160> see<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.270> took

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
intervening atmosphere to see so we took

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.510 
intervening atmosphere to see so we took
some<00:01:53.660> really<00:01:54.170> neat<00:01:54.349> pictures<00:01:54.709> last<00:01:55.130> night<00:01:55.399> at

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
some really neat pictures last night at

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.309 
some really neat pictures last night at
about<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.819> hundred<00:01:55.910> or<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:56.840> hope<00:01:57.200> to

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
about a hundred or so that we hope to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.859 
about a hundred or so that we hope to
make<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.470> movie<00:01:57.860> out<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:58.479> just<00:01:59.479> wanted<00:01:59.750> to

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
make a movie out of but just wanted to

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.029 
make a movie out of but just wanted to
toss<00:02:00.050> that<00:02:00.259> out<00:02:00.319> in<00:02:00.590> case<00:02:00.739> you're<00:02:00.890> interested

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
toss that out in case you're interested

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.179 
toss that out in case you're interested
it's<00:02:01.700> quite<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.910> place
