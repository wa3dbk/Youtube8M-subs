base in a new world and whatever so
that's<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.150> guess<00:00:35.210> what<00:00:35.450> this<00:00:35.540> video<00:00:35.810> is<00:00:35.870> about

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
you guys around the sphere base that I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.590 
you guys around the sphere base that I
made<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.530> I<00:00:40.130> mean<00:00:40.310> nothing<00:00:40.670> changed<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:41.450> there

made and I mean nothing changed in there
I<00:00:41.630> mean<00:00:41.720> I<00:00:41.810> added<00:00:42.110> some<00:00:42.140> small<00:00:42.590> stuff<00:00:42.740> but

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.410 
I mean I added some small stuff but
early<00:00:43.160> doesn't<00:00:43.400> matter<00:00:43.520> what<00:00:43.970> I<00:00:44.030> want<00:00:44.210> to<00:00:44.270> show

you right now is this little area right

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.630 
you right now is this little area right
here<00:00:47.590> when<00:00:48.590> I<00:00:48.620> was<00:00:48.740> digging<00:00:49.070> on<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.430> side<00:00:49.610> of

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
here when I was digging on the side of

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.280 
here when I was digging on the side of
my<00:00:49.760> base<00:00:50.150> I<00:00:50.390> accidentally<00:00:50.720> hit<00:00:50.810> a<00:00:50.840> waterfall

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
my base I accidentally hit a waterfall

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.230 
my base I accidentally hit a waterfall
and<00:00:51.410> flooded<00:00:51.770> my<00:00:51.860> entire<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.610> guess<00:00:52.880> you<00:00:53.060> call

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
and flooded my entire I guess you call

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.750 
and flooded my entire I guess you call
it<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.360> front<00:00:53.690> lawn<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.290> my<00:00:54.560> base<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.160> because

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
it a front lawn of my base and because

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.910 
it a front lawn of my base and because
of<00:00:55.790> that<00:00:55.880> it<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:57.050> was<00:00:57.170> really<00:00:57.260> frustrating

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
of that it just was really frustrating

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.440 
of that it just was really frustrating
to<00:00:58.070> move<00:00:58.220> around<00:00:58.370> especially<00:00:58.790> at<00:00:59.210> night

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
to move around especially at night

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.120 
to move around especially at night
especially<00:00:59.660> when<00:01:00.260> you're<00:01:00.380> not<00:01:00.560> when<00:01:00.920> I<00:01:00.950> was

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
especially when you're not when I was

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.340 
especially when you're not when I was
not<00:01:01.250> peaceful<00:01:01.550> just<00:01:02.510> you<00:01:02.780> know<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.080> was<00:01:03.170> just<00:01:03.200> a

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
not peaceful just you know it was just a

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.340 
not peaceful just you know it was just a
big<00:01:03.500> hassle<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.070> i<00:01:04.330> petitioned<00:01:05.330> or<00:01:05.600> sectioned

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
big hassle so i petitioned or sectioned

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.990 
big hassle so i petitioned or sectioned
off<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.800> front<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:07.250> maybe<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:07.670> really<00:01:07.820> cool

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
off the front and maybe it's really cool

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.210 
off the front and maybe it's really cool
little<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.540> guess<00:01:08.870> barriers<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:10.130> know

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
little I guess barriers you know

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.420 
little I guess barriers you know
whatever<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.790> think<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.180> looks<00:01:11.210> cool<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:12.430> then

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
whatever I think it looks cool but then

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.650 
whatever I think it looks cool but then
from<00:01:13.640> there<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.820> sort<00:01:14.150> of<00:01:14.210> thought<00:01:14.360> you<00:01:14.570> know

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
from there I sort of thought you know

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.030 
from there I sort of thought you know
what<00:01:14.780> if<00:01:14.900> I<00:01:14.960> dug<00:01:15.140> down<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.590> started<00:01:15.800> building

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
what if I dug down and started building

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.830 
what if I dug down and started building
underwater<00:01:16.310> that's<00:01:17.150> sort<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.450> big<00:01:17.630> thing

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
underwater that's sort of the big thing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.910 
underwater that's sort of the big thing
right<00:01:17.990> now<00:01:18.020> ever<00:01:18.200> was<00:01:18.350> making<00:01:18.590> underwater

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
right now ever was making underwater

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.190 
right now ever was making underwater
bases<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.430> dumb<00:01:19.670> stuff<00:01:19.970> like<00:01:20.120> that<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:20.960> dug

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
bases and dumb stuff like that so I dug

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.200 
bases and dumb stuff like that so I dug
under<00:01:21.440> that<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.040> managed<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.820> find<00:01:23.120> some

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
under that and I managed to find some

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.920 
under that and I managed to find some
pretty<00:01:23.750> big<00:01:23.990> caverns<00:01:24.410> that<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.650> excavated<00:01:25.930> so

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
pretty big caverns that I excavated so

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.460 
pretty big caverns that I excavated so
you<00:01:27.380> can<00:01:27.530> sort<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.800> see<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:29.260> magnitude<00:01:30.260> I

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
you can sort of see the magnitude I

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.590 
you can sort of see the magnitude I
guess<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:30.860> could<00:01:30.890> say<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:32.240> this

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
guess you could say of the this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.270 
guess you could say of the this
underground<00:01:33.080> cavern<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:33.710> dug<00:01:33.890> out<00:01:34.070> I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
underground cavern that I dug out I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.210 
underground cavern that I dug out I
can't<00:01:35.030> take<00:01:35.210> full<00:01:35.420> credit<00:01:35.540> for<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.080> course

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
can't take full credit for it of course

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.920 
can't take full credit for it of course
there<00:01:37.220> were<00:01:37.370> some<00:01:37.820> pretty<00:01:38.000> big<00:01:38.240> for<00:01:38.510> existing

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
there were some pretty big for existing
