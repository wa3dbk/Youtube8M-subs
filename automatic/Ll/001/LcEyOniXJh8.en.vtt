opinion<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
opinion because you know this you get to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.940 
opinion because you know this you get to
see<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> full<00:02:01.979> body<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.540> not

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
see the full body is it's just not

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
see the full body is it's just not
strangely<00:02:04.950> designed<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.630> pretty

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
strangely designed it's actually pretty

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.650 
strangely designed it's actually pretty
designed<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:08.099> nicely<00:02:08.390> anyways<00:02:09.390> we're

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
designed pretty nicely anyways we're

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.290 
designed pretty nicely anyways we're
gonna<00:02:09.750> move<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:11.400> summon<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
gonna move on and just summon it and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.840 
gonna move on and just summon it and
feed<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
feed it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.280 
feed it
so<00:02:14.850> there<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.240> when<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.900> feed<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.420> it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so there it is when you feed it and it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.610 
so there it is when you feed it and it
grows<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.310> become<00:02:20.460> its<00:02:20.970> adult<00:02:21.390> form<00:02:21.590> now<00:02:22.590> I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
grows up to become its adult form now I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.790 
grows up to become its adult form now I
know<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.460> exactly<00:02:24.290> its<00:02:25.290> adult<00:02:25.680> form

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
know that this is exactly its adult form

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.880 
know that this is exactly its adult form
but<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.870> same<00:02:28.110> thing<00:02:28.560> there's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
but you know it's the same thing there's

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.590 
but you know it's the same thing there's
not<00:02:29.010> much<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.760> difference<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.330> looks

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
not much of a difference it looks

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.910 
not much of a difference it looks
exactly<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.320> same

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
exactly the same

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.800 
exactly the same
they<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.400> kind<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.700> made<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> bigger<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.660> in

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
they just kind of made it bigger and in

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500 
they just kind of made it bigger and in
my<00:02:33.990> opinion<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.710> doesn't<00:02:35.190> matter<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.480> me

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
my opinion that doesn't matter to me

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.600 
my opinion that doesn't matter to me
that<00:02:36.630> much<00:02:37.110> because<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:38.130> because<00:02:38.430> it's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that much because this because it's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
that much because this because it's
bigger<00:02:38.880> doesn't<00:02:39.240> mean<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.990> different

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
bigger doesn't mean it's a different

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.890 
bigger doesn't mean it's a different
dragon<00:02:41.070> it's<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> exact<00:02:41.670> same<00:02:41.700> design<00:02:42.270> exact

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
dragon it's the exact same design exact

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.350 
dragon it's the exact same design exact
same<00:02:43.170> look<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.980> only<00:02:44.100> thing<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.940> course<00:02:45.210> it

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
same look the only thing is of course it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.090 
same look the only thing is of course it
looks<00:02:45.390> bigger<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.050> then<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.680> description

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
looks bigger and then the description

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.050 
looks bigger and then the description
screen<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:48.360> will<00:02:48.510> say<00:02:48.750> adult<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:50.100> other<00:02:50.790> than

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
screen it will say adult but other than

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.750 
screen it will say adult but other than
that<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> same<00:02:52.500> thing<00:02:52.890> if<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.730> just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that it's the same thing if you just

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.990 
that it's the same thing if you just
analyze<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.720> design<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.520> neglect<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.700> tax

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
analyze the design and neglect the tax

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.790 
analyze the design and neglect the tax
site<00:02:57.300> it's<00:02:57.810> kind<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.140> like<00:02:58.320> saying<00:02:58.620> hey

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
site it's kind of like saying hey

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.900 
site it's kind of like saying hey
torches<00:03:01.800> mother<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.550> torch<00:03:03.090> are<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
torches mother and torch are the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.340 
torches mother and torch are the
different<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.090> guess<00:03:06.420> they're<00:03:06.660> different<00:03:06.870> in

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
different I guess they're different in

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.800 
different I guess they're different in
the<00:03:08.040> aspect<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.820> hey<00:03:09.060> they<00:03:09.270> have<00:03:09.390> different

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
the aspect of hey they have different

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.940 
the aspect of hey they have different
colors<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.620> they<00:03:10.800> look<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.190> same<00:03:11.450> obviously

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
colors but they look the same obviously

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.160 
colors but they look the same obviously
the<00:03:13.950> design<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.209> same<00:03:15.450> there's<00:03:15.780> not<00:03:15.930> much

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
the design is the same there's not much

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930 
the design is the same there's not much
of<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.380> difference<00:03:16.560> between<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> design<00:03:17.670> in

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
of a difference between the design in

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.770 
of a difference between the design in

it's<00:06:13.229> not<00:06:13.440> going<00:06:13.860> to<00:06:14.250> like<00:06:14.520> you<00:06:14.820> know<00:06:15.240> stick

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
it's not going to like you know stick

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.209 
it's not going to like you know stick
there<00:06:15.870> for<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.110> really<00:06:16.320> long<00:06:16.530> time<00:06:16.889> I<00:06:16.919> think

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:17.219 
there for a really long time I think

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:19.810 
there for a really long time I think
it's<00:06:17.880> gonna<00:06:18.000> break<00:06:18.300> it's<00:06:18.539> easily<00:06:18.870> damaged

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
it's gonna break it's easily damaged

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.120 
it's gonna break it's easily damaged
because<00:06:20.820> it<00:06:21.210> it's<00:06:21.599> thin<00:06:21.960> right<00:06:22.320> and<00:06:22.530> then<00:06:22.710> it's

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
because it it's thin right and then it's

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.279 
because it it's thin right and then it's
kind<00:06:23.430> of<00:06:23.520> like<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:24.120> don't<00:06:24.870> know<00:06:24.930> it's<00:06:25.050> kind<00:06:25.259> of

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
kind of like I don't know it's kind of

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.200

Titan<00:06:51.130> training<00:06:51.640> hoping<00:06:52.270> hoping<00:06:52.720> that<00:06:53.320> they

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
Titan training hoping hoping that they

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.370 
Titan training hoping hoping that they
would<00:06:53.920> become<00:06:54.460> Titans<00:06:55.240> but<00:06:55.570> definitely<00:06:56.140> that

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
would become Titans but definitely that

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.990 
would become Titans but definitely that
might<00:06:56.950> take<00:06:57.130> a<00:06:57.190> while<00:06:57.310> that's<00:06:57.610> not<00:06:57.730> gonna<00:06:57.910> take

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
might take a while that's not gonna take

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.500 
might take a while that's not gonna take
that's<00:06:58.810> not<00:06:58.960> gonna<00:06:59.080> be<00:06:59.200> easy<00:06:59.470> of<00:07:00.310> course

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
that's not gonna be easy of course

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.950 
that's not gonna be easy of course
