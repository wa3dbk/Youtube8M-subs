 It is a place where you can dive overboard with your inflatable life jacket on. 

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.631
 Falling water! Did. 

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:49.838
 Recent sneakers have buoyancy so it is better not to take off. 

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:27.152
 To minimize energy consumption in the sea, please round your body and reduce the water contact area. 

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:34.330
 It is best to move your hands by moving your hands like a rower when moving a dropper. 

00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:57.690
 Even if you find a dropper, the rescuer should throw a buoyant body such as a lifebuoy to the dropper without jumping directly into the sea. 

00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:57.690
 If the water catcher grabs the float, pull the rope attached to the float and rescue it. 

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:25.270
 When waiting for rescue, don't move around unwillingly and save your strength. 

00:03:54.173 --> 00:03:59.170
 It seems that there is a service to notify the current position (latitude / longitude) of the recent mobile phones registered in advance in the emergency, so please contact the mobile phone company in detail. It seems best to wear such equipment or call “118” on a cell phone in a waterproof pack and wait for rescue.
