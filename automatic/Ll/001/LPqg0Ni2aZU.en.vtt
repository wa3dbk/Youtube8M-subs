completely<00:01:34.920> dead<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.479> he's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
completely dead now I do think that he's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.870 
completely dead now I do think that he's
still<00:01:37.409> middle-aged<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> he<00:01:38.189> still<00:01:38.400> has<00:01:38.579> life

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880

still middle-aged and he still has life
in<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.150> industry<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:40.170> really

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
in this industry but I don't really

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
in this industry but I don't really
think<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.799> he's<00:01:41.009> gonna<00:01:41.159> come<00:01:41.430> back<00:01:41.610> from<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
think that he's gonna come back from a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.929 
think that he's gonna come back from a
flop<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.560> too<00:01:44.130> fast<00:01:44.369> he<00:01:44.610> has<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> couple

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
flop like that too fast he has a couple

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.249 
flop like that too fast he has a couple
things<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.210> he's<00:01:45.360> working<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.720> right<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
things that he's working on right now I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.100

that he didn't write it too so that that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.980 
that he didn't write it too so that that
is<00:01:55.710> definitely<00:01:56.159> something<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:57.060> works<00:01:57.689> for

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.750 
and you see I use this more as a scope I
scope<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.379> hard<00:03:10.650> scope<00:03:10.859> but<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.670> it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
scope in hard scope but I think of it

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.129 
scope in hard scope but I think of it
more<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.000> aiming<00:03:12.329> down<00:03:12.420> sights<00:03:12.480> because<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.079> do

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
more as aiming down sights because I do

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.379 
more as aiming down sights because I do
i<00:03:13.470> do<00:03:13.859> think<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.370> weapon<00:03:14.549> has<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.879> assault

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
i do think of this weapon has a assault

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.990 
i do think of this weapon has a assault
rifle<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:15.840> sort<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.440> conceived<00:03:16.859> as<00:03:17.010> such<00:03:17.190> and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
rifle it sort of conceived as such and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.360 
rifle it sort of conceived as such and
it's<00:03:18.389> like<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.720> version<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:19.799> has<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:19.980> scope

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it's like a version it just has a scope

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.520 
it's like a version it just has a scope
on<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.579> phone<00:03:20.879> so<00:03:21.239> it's<00:03:21.389> like<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.599> m1014<00:03:21.930> from

get stabbed in the back i would not have

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.220 
get stabbed in the back i would not have
been<00:03:51.810> good<00:03:52.069> so<00:03:53.540> reloading<00:03:54.540> my<00:03:54.629> striker<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.169> do

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
been good so reloading my striker I do

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.990 
been good so reloading my striker I do
have<00:03:55.500> scavenger<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.099> because<00:03:56.489> both<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
have scavenger on because both the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.050 
have scavenger on because both the
striker<00:03:57.359> and<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:58.169> m21<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.919> lose<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.579> fair<00:03:59.879> bit<00:04:00.000> of

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
striker and the m21 I lose a fair bit of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.520 
striker and the m21 I lose a fair bit of
ammo<00:04:00.359> really<00:04:00.690> fast<00:04:00.930> if<00:04:01.109> you're<00:04:01.230> not<00:04:01.319> careful

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
ammo really fast if you're not careful

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.979 
ammo really fast if you're not careful
and<00:04:01.859> I<00:04:02.669> like<00:04:03.000> using<00:04:03.150> sleight<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.510> hand<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:03.870> it

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and I like using sleight of hand with it

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.720 
and I like using sleight of hand with it
but<00:04:04.139> that<00:04:04.260> would<00:04:04.379> mean<00:04:04.500> taking<00:04:04.769> somebody

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
but that would mean taking somebody

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.159 
but that would mean taking somebody
else's<00:04:05.790> weapon<00:04:06.239> when<00:04:06.389> I<00:04:06.419> run<00:04:06.569> on<00:04:06.690> two<00:04:06.810> MO<00:04:07.019> and

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
else's weapon when I run on two MO and

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.930 
else's weapon when I run on two MO and
that<00:04:07.290> really<00:04:07.440> wouldn't<00:04:07.680> be<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:08.010> request<00:04:08.760> game

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
that really wouldn't be a request game

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.509 
that really wouldn't be a request game
so<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> usually<00:04:09.419> try<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.690> use<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.979> man<00:04:11.099> army<00:04:11.250> or

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
so I usually try and use one man army or

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.330 
so I usually try and use one man army or
scavenger<00:04:11.940> when<00:04:12.659> I<00:04:12.690> have<00:04:12.959> weapons<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.859> I<00:04:14.099> want

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
scavenger when I have weapons I I want

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.830 
scavenger when I have weapons I I want
to<00:04:14.400> use<00:04:14.519> because<00:04:14.699> I<00:04:14.879> don't<00:04:15.060> want<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.299> be

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
to use because I don't want to be

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.420 
to use because I don't want to be
tempted<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.260> pick<00:04:16.530> up<00:04:16.650> somebody's<00:04:16.979> weapon<00:04:17.280> and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
tempted to pick up somebody's weapon and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.930 
tempted to pick up somebody's weapon and
start<00:04:17.639> using<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.120> call<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.389> an<00:04:19.169> m21<00:04:19.620> match

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
start using it and call it an m21 match

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.640 
start using it and call it an m21 match
so<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:20.969> can't<00:04:21.329> really<00:04:21.450> get<00:04:21.659> many<00:04:21.870> FMJ<00:04:22.380> kills

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
so I can't really get many FMJ kills

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.950 
so I can't really get many FMJ kills
here<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.099> I'm<00:04:23.190> just<00:04:23.370> trying<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.940> get<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.750> rest

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
here and I'm just trying to get the rest

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.390 
here and I'm just trying to get the rest

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
the spawns are and I you see me go for

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.490 
the spawns are and I you see me go for
the<00:04:51.270> FMJ<00:04:51.660> kill<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.900> don't<00:04:52.080> even<00:04:52.139> get<00:04:52.289> a<00:04:52.350> hit

but I wanted to hear you guys thoughts

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.800 
but I wanted to hear you guys thoughts
actually<00:04:56.550> on<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:57.000> m21<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.020> I<00:04:59.389> more<00:05:00.389> in-depth

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
actually on the m21 and I more in-depth

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.750 
actually on the m21 and I more in-depth
into<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.860> thought<00:05:02.100> process<00:05:02.490> here<00:05:02.520> is

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
into the the thought process here is

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.270 
into the the thought process here is
actually<00:05:03.000> i<00:05:03.410> have<00:05:04.410> been<00:05:04.560> using<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.949> on<00:05:05.130> both

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
actually i have been using this on both

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.879 
actually i have been using this on both
accounts<00:05:05.550> with<00:05:05.820> my<00:05:05.970> 360<00:05:06.449> and<00:05:06.690> my<00:05:06.900> ps3<00:05:07.500> account

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
accounts with my 360 and my ps3 account

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.950 
accounts with my 360 and my ps3 account
and<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.789> see<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.030> is<00:05:09.180> recorded<00:05:09.539> on<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.690> ps3

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
and you see this is recorded on the ps3

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.870 
and you see this is recorded on the ps3
and<00:05:10.260> that's<00:05:10.380> because<00:05:10.590> i<00:05:10.949> like<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.490> controller

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
and that's because i like the controller

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.939 
and that's because i like the controller
a<00:05:11.940> lot<00:05:12.180> more<00:05:12.419> for<00:05:12.780> using<00:05:13.110> single<00:05:13.320> shot<00:05:13.560> rifles

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
a lot more for using single shot rifles

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.430 
a lot more for using single shot rifles
especially<00:05:14.910> spammable<00:05:15.360> ones<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.960> m21

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
especially spammable ones like the m21

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.000 
especially spammable ones like the m21
just<00:05:17.039> because<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.460> triggers<00:05:17.940> are<00:05:18.860> they<00:05:19.860> they

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
just because the triggers are they they

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.920 
just because the triggers are they they
have<00:05:20.160> a<00:05:20.190> lot<00:05:20.370> less<00:05:20.550> definition<00:05:21.090> and<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.780> lot

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
have a lot less definition and a lot

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.409 
have a lot less definition and a lot
less<00:05:21.960> resistance<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:23.070> that<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:24.030> was<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> lag

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
less resistance and that that was a lag

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.210 
less resistance and that that was a lag
fill<00:05:24.690> right<00:05:24.870> there<00:05:25.020> i<00:05:25.050> go<00:05:25.259> from<00:05:25.500> too<00:05:25.800> far<00:05:25.979> as<00:05:26.070> to

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
fill right there i go from too far as to

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.290 
fill right there i go from too far as to
four<00:05:26.400> bars<00:05:26.580> i<00:05:26.729> think<00:05:26.940> i<00:05:27.000> was<00:05:27.120> actually

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
four bars i think i was actually

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.510 
four bars i think i was actually
uploading<00:05:27.930> something<00:05:28.139> this<00:05:28.349> game<00:05:28.590> so<00:05:29.220> you'll

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
uploading something this game so you'll

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.800 
uploading something this game so you'll
see<00:05:29.699> me<00:05:29.820> get<00:05:29.940> four<00:05:30.150> bars<00:05:30.330> at<00:05:30.479> the<00:05:30.510> end<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.720> the

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
see me get four bars at the end of the

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.719 
see me get four bars at the end of the
match<00:05:30.930> probably<00:05:31.380> but<00:05:31.560> there<00:05:32.070> was<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.310> fair

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
match probably but there was a fair

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:33.850 
match probably but there was a fair
amount<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.970> time<00:05:33.090> where<00:05:33.270> has<00:05:33.389> the<00:05:33.479> two<00:05:33.599> bars

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
amount of time where has the two bars

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.560 
amount of time where has the two bars
but<00:05:34.860> i<00:05:34.889> was<00:05:35.070> happy<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.550> my<00:05:36.030> teammate<00:05:36.360> took

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
but i was happy that my teammate took

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.790 
but i was happy that my teammate took
out<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:36.870> dude<00:05:37.020> because<00:05:37.229> I<00:05:37.349> probably<00:05:37.620> would

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
out that dude because I probably would

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.670 
out that dude because I probably would
have<00:05:37.860> died<00:05:38.039> I<00:05:38.310> get<00:05:38.940> my<00:05:39.030> AC<00:05:39.180> 130<00:05:39.479> and<00:05:39.780> I<00:05:40.260> get<00:05:40.590> the

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
have died I get my AC 130 and I get the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.260 
have died I get my AC 130 and I get the
hell<00:05:40.800> out<00:05:40.919> of<00:05:40.949> there<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.729> hell<00:05:41.880> out<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.030> Dodge

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
hell out of there the hell out of Dodge

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.529 
hell out of there the hell out of Dodge

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
and Colin my AC 130 because I would

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.710 
and Colin my AC 130 because I would
definitely<00:05:45.659> suggest<00:05:45.960> using<00:05:46.770> an<00:05:46.979> ac-130<00:05:47.940> over

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
definitely suggest using an ac-130 over

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.850 
chopper gunner on this map mainly
because<00:05:50.370> if<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:51.419> get<00:05:51.570> a<00:05:51.720> solid<00:05:51.990> ac-130<00:05:52.710> hit

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860

fair amount of fuels as you see right

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.490

there<00:05:59.820> but<00:06:00.750> if<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:00.930> use<00:06:01.050> a<00:06:01.080> chopper<00:06:01.470> gunner

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
there but if you use a chopper gunner

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.200 
there but if you use a chopper gunner
you<00:06:01.800> really<00:06:02.070> have<00:06:02.220> to<00:06:02.340> aim<00:06:02.490> right<00:06:02.820> and<00:06:03.060> you

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
you really have to aim right and you

you really have to aim right and you
have<00:06:03.419> to<00:06:03.570> rely<00:06:04.229> on<00:06:04.260> the<00:06:04.470> fact<00:06:04.620> that<00:06:04.800> the

have to rely on the fact that the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
chopper gunner pilot will be somewhat

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.740 
chopper gunner pilot will be somewhat

knowledgeable as where the spawns are in

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.600 
knowledgeable as where the spawns are in
such<00:06:09.930> which<00:06:10.169> I<00:06:10.380> never<00:06:10.590> rely<00:06:11.159> on<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:11.370> chopper

such which I never rely on the chopper
gunner<00:06:11.760> that<00:06:11.940> much<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.330> usually<00:06:12.750> use<00:06:12.900> a

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
gunner that much so I usually use a

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.219 
gunner that much so I usually use a
c-130<00:06:13.500> s<00:06:13.620> instead<00:06:13.919> and<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:15.090> this<00:06:15.240> map<00:06:15.419> with<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
c-130 s instead and on this map with the

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.600 
c-130 s instead and on this map with the
amount<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.620> open<00:06:16.919> space<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.340> amount<00:06:17.550> of

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
amount of open space and the amount of

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.760 
amount of open space and the amount of
buildings<00:06:18.000> its<00:06:18.599> its<00:06:18.870> lean<00:06:19.110> toward<00:06:19.440> building

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
buildings its its lean toward building

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.890 
buildings its its lean toward building
so<00:06:19.979> i<00:06:20.010> highly<00:06:20.639> recommend<00:06:21.120> a<00:06:21.240> someone<00:06:21.479> 30s<00:06:21.780> for
