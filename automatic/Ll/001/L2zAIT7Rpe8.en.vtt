00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.409
 new problem 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:16.750
 starting ok 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:24.300
 continue starting here we don't play 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:29.170
 perfectly connected starting well 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.269
 problem as we are still connected in 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:37.170
 audio obviously doesn't sound starting 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.170
 let's start off again 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:54.539
 turn on starting ok now yes 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.539
 perfect 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.859
 well now let's load a kit 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.810
 ok we are waiting for you 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:30.130
 meanwhile we are waiting for register also in 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.270
 audio on the computer so I show you 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:39.590
 the difference 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:42.640
 ok i do n't know if you can notice sorry ok 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.500
 perfect all right the track is there 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 agree now we go here we have 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:02:03.250
 loaded the settings ok tom2 let's go 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.250
 here on absolutely on tom 2 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:13.360
 here we are, this is still like now 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:27.910
 here I pressed ok voila from zero at least 0 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.910
 20 and the sound changes 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:50.060
 note that the kick perfectly 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.390
 connected there which is now look at what 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.390
 It happens 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:13.640
 kick it whoever is presented tom there 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:26.090
 sale 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:33.370
 ok with three perfect sequins ride and 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.370
 grows continues 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:55.260
 ok it's no perfect present kit again 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.940
 now with the battery on 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.980
 let's change our grip 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:13.380
 ok put here let's finish healthcare it 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:21.230
 same problem should already sound 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.230
 so a minimum because 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.950
 okay so i am but if one has to 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:36.540
 support, however, not always slowly 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:41.320
 let's see if the wording now 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.980
 now fashion so maybe it has a problem 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.980
 let's go charles 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.370
 here's what I say for the natural but 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.370
 never mind 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:28.019
 but we are also a little bit of Calabria 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:28.019
 according to laurel 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:02.590
 I found this problem in 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:04.780
 all three hi hats, if anything, I said 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.699
 First, because so much you were not there 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.800
 replacing the others then at the end 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:12.370
 it doesn't even need to be done 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:18.310
 note however error then you will see it from 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:21.400
 we are only now at the mechanics program 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.930
 of mechanically chaste point themes though 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.789
 they make me spend useless money for 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.719
 I don't want to be argumentative 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.719
 be careful though 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.129
 these are the problems
