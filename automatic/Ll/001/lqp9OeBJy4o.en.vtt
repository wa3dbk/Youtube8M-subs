00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.170
 Hello UTB psycho arthur and today 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.789
 We will be a video of the discharge tips on 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.740
 the game 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:19.210
 today us maps of the tundra tankman 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.740
 and the first thing I want to notice right away is 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.710
 direction which you should choose 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.570
 would you start in my opinion the most 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.030
 important direction for heavy tank 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.760
 it is on this map that this is the zero line 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:36.460
 here it is to me this is something like 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.370
 pants in karelia ie card though 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.050
 slightly different in the arrangement of these 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.540
 most pants if they are on the bark 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.650
 centered here they are from the edge of the map but all 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.800
 equally they have a very important 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.140
 strategic importance and if their 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000
 ranked enemy command especial 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.280
 dummy which climbed up if this 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.460
 leave the situation to chance 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.980
 then in the future it will be a defeat 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 because sooner or later they will light 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.420
 artillery and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.450
 will continue to shoot our 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.760
 slides can quickly jump off 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.120
 capture in general is the direction you need 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.770
 just clean that is it very 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.340
 strongly contracts poteshki 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.090
 from square a zero respectively our 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.040
 tops, too, to 0 control from us but 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.500
 give them work and try to somehow 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.410
 lure your opponent you can say 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.630
 yes, I will choose from the power of the litter therefore 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.540
 here you only have to rely on 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.780
 yourself and your sovzvodnyh 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.040
 Actually I do this here. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.330
 sovzvodnye me on braces 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 they stand in the conor and in principle still 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.440
 about the planet because here they are not 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.930
 could work normally because 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.130
 in these stones you definitely need towers and 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.410
 if you have . 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.920
 even with good reservations for example 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:01.490
 t110 3 years cps then play here 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.320
 effectively you will not succeed but succeed 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.290
 but not as effective as cha 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.020
 effective status I leave overboard 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.369
 strongly substitute but it 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.590
 forced measures to be faster 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.019
 faster pick opponents on this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.480
 flank and at this stage can be 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.860
 various actions that is you can or 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.709
 advance further therefore flank 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.380
 jump or climb up 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.700
 as fri-shka in this case I decide 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.819
 return to the other flank 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.540
 purely because of the fact that we clinked it 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.670
 asked and accordingly there are the most 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.610
 great enemy forces this moment 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.050
 Of course I waste a little because 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.220
 watch what kind of stop moves 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.599
 through polkarta it is of course epic 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.709
 mobility and 100 is no different but so 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.959
 as a battle, we have won 50 percent 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.580
 then I grew up a little bit here from 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.269
 what nickname so slowly 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.670
 food and while e100 rides you must choose 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.349
 Your goal, that is, you must initially 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.180
 already notice who you attack and 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.640
 actually to him from moving and here i am 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.920
 noticed yag pz e100 i understand that i have 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.269
 one hundred percent is enough for one shot 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.290
 because I know that alpha is lower than him 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.720
 my try 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.690
 even if a food from from pass then take away 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.200
 I can not scratch at it, I calmly 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.700
 I leave I put rum case groups could 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.620
 get in ld at an angle or in 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.180
 caterpillars bottom without damage on this 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.310
 doesn't happen it passes him very 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.060
 powerful such damage 1109 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.879
 I kicked it straight but it opens here 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.670
 minus supposedly for and because before driving 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.470
 the fact that milk recharge is about 22 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.930
 seconds while the alpha building better 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.610
 but in a one-on-one shootout in my 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.060
 anyway lose because on 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.370
 century smaller and when worse and the tower 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.319
 do not have a living and so was 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.209
 and even if I lost by recharging 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.830
 I was just put on the rink and 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.880
 got into a fight water further all fight 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.459
 made that is the most important decision 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.070
 which was which led to victory 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.919
 this is a zero line sweep without as 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.500
 only we didnâ€™t understand at all 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.360
 killed heavy tanks and killed rate 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.720
 which climbed up in fact we already 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.190
 the battle was done further simply 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.360
 standard 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.670
 finishing opponents themselves therefore 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.220
 no need to experiment on strands on 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.300
 This card is especially at the tenth level 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.280
 always advise you first 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.980
 go to zero and only then engage 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.110
 other fangs 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.360
 These are the actual things, thank you for 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.160
 viewing 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.460
 lucky you bend in on e100 and others 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.780
 German tank superheroes and wait 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.780
 new videos all good luck
