Steve edges to take screws out all the
way<00:01:57.840> along<00:01:57.960> here

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
way along here

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.390 
way along here
two<00:01:59.880> should<00:02:00.210> ask<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.830> same<00:02:01.830> on<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.100> other<00:02:02.130> end

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
two should ask I same on the other end

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.270 
two should ask I same on the other end
maybe<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.270> couple<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.900> either<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.380> edge<00:02:04.620> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
maybe a couple down either this edge of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.850 
maybe a couple down either this edge of
this<00:02:05.640> edge<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.960> old<00:02:07.350> panel<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
this edge and then the old panel is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.499
