going to pop that apparently we're

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.160 
going to pop that apparently we're
looking<00:03:02.580> at<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.760> recipe<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.239> says<00:03:03.480> here<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
looking at the recipe it says here the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.250

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
balances out the bitterness of the beer

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.500 
balances out the bitterness of the beer

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.500 

at<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.099> same<00:03:45.340> time<00:03:45.609> is<00:03:45.790> putting<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.239> into

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
at the same time is putting this into

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.509 
at the same time is putting this into
the<00:03:47.260> college<00:03:47.530> another<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.099> pop<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
the college another and I pop the

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.280 
the college another and I pop the
potatoes<00:03:49.060> onto<00:03:49.239> mash<00:03:49.629> was<00:03:49.930> willing<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.200> have

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
potatoes onto mash was willing to have

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
it with mashed potato right now I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.449 
it with mashed potato right now I
thought<00:03:52.599> this<00:03:52.719> would<00:03:52.870> take<00:03:53.170> 30<00:03:53.469> minutes<00:03:53.859> with

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
thought this would take 30 minutes with

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.149 
thought this would take 30 minutes with
the<00:03:54.909> tray<00:03:55.510> underneath<00:03:55.900> for<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.469> sit<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.859> and

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
the tray underneath for it to sit on and

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.670 
the tray underneath for it to sit on and
a<00:03:57.219> spacer<00:03:57.569> however<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.719> found<00:03:59.079> it<00:03:59.230> was<00:03:59.349> a<00:03:59.379> mini

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
a spacer however I found it was a mini

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.979 
a spacer however I found it was a mini
bubbling<00:04:00.189> if<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.879> want<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.480> meal<00:04:01.689> that<00:04:01.719> you<00:04:01.959> can

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
pop in the halogen oven and leave for an

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.429 
pop in the halogen oven and leave for an
hour<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.450> would<00:04:04.599> be<00:04:04.659> perfect<00:04:05.230> like<00:04:05.379> that

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
hour it would be perfect like that

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.039 
hour it would be perfect like that
however<00:04:06.310> we<00:04:06.700> need<00:04:06.939> to<00:04:07.000> tweet<00:04:07.329> a<00:04:07.359> bit<00:04:07.629> sooner

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
however we need to tweet a bit sooner

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.110 
however we need to tweet a bit sooner
than<00:04:08.079> that<00:04:08.379> so<00:04:08.889> I've<00:04:09.040> taken<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.579> space<00:04:09.819> from

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
than that so I've taken the space from

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.059 
than that so I've taken the space from
out<00:04:10.239> but<00:04:10.480> crop<00:04:10.719> the<00:04:10.930> level<00:04:11.349> of<00:04:11.469> the<00:04:11.590> dish<00:04:11.799> to

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
an hour an hour on the stove I'm credit

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.760 
an hour an hour on the stove I'm credit
checking<00:04:24.370> this<00:04:24.520> all<00:04:24.789> right<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.900> do<00:04:26.169> like<00:04:26.560> the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
checking this all right so I do like the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.320 
checking this all right so I do like the
idea<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.220> rest<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.550> me<00:04:27.639> being<00:04:27.910> cooked<00:04:28.120> like

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
idea of the rest of me being cooked like

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.140 
idea of the rest of me being cooked like
this<00:04:28.599> however<00:04:29.520> because<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.820> distance

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
this however because of the distance

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.610 
this however because of the distance
with<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.419> space<00:04:31.660> that<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.080> wasn't<00:04:32.229> cooking

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
with the space that it wasn't cooking

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.710 
with the space that it wasn't cooking
quite<00:04:32.979> quick<00:04:33.250> enough<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:34.210> there<00:04:34.389> you<00:04:34.509> are
