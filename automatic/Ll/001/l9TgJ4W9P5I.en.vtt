to rate you can build I do show you a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.779 
to rate you can build I do show you a
unbreakable<00:00:25.529> jail<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.099> once<00:00:26.580> you're<00:00:26.730> in

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
understand this is just a simple clock

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
understand this is just a simple clock
going<00:00:58.440> around<00:00:58.710> around<00:00:58.859> powering<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.399> piston

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
going around around powering this piston

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.279 
going around around powering this piston
repetitively<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:00.960> pushing<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
repetitively and then it's pushing this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.830 
repetitively and then it's pushing this
block<00:01:01.530> back<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.800> forth<00:01:02.160> simple<00:01:03.090> stuff<00:01:03.359> kids

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
block back and forth simple stuff kids

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
block back and forth simple stuff kids

and we can't and I'm sure you guys can
figure<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.000> why<00:01:09.210> obviously<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> box

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
figure out why obviously you see the box

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
figure out why obviously you see the box
that<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.260> select<00:01:13.619> the

be able to but you can't get that in the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.520 
be able to but you can't get that in the
game<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.060> efficiency<00:01:30.720> 5<00:01:30.960> won't<00:01:31.290> break

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
game and I know efficiency 5 won't break

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.580 
game and I know efficiency 5 won't break
it<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.729> go<00:01:32.909> catch<00:01:33.869> some<00:01:33.900> more<00:01:34.320> for

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it so there you go catch some more for

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
it so there you go catch some more for
efficiency<00:01:35.250> 5<00:01:35.430> pick<00:01:35.700> them<00:01:35.909> they're<00:01:36.060> still

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
efficiency 5 pick them they're still

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.359 
efficiency 5 pick them they're still
stuck<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.189> anyway

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
stuck in there anyway

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.069 
stuck in there anyway
let's<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.060> ahead<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> move<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.840> which

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
let's go ahead and move on to this which

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
let's go ahead and move on to this which
is<00:01:40.200> pretty<00:01:40.320> much<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> same<00:01:40.829> thing<00:01:41.070> except<00:01:41.400> oh

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is pretty much the same thing except oh

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.980 
is pretty much the same thing except oh
you've<00:01:41.640> we've<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.119> extended<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.869> bit

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
you've we've just extended a little bit

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.200 
you've we've just extended a little bit
we've<00:01:43.110> used<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.250> repeaters<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.939> top<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
we've used you know repeaters on top of

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
we've used you know repeaters on top of
each<00:01:45.270> other<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> power<00:01:45.720> these<00:01:45.960> free<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
each other to power these free and you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
each other to power these free and you
can<00:01:47.369> keep<00:01:47.520> building<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> same

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
can keep building up just with the same

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.210 
can keep building up just with the same
structure<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.380> new<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> red<00:01:49.740> soon<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
structure if you're new to red soon and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.130 
structure if you're new to red soon and
if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.149> new<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> redstone<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.079> I'm

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
if you are new to redstone that I'm

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410 
if you are new to redstone that I'm
gonna<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.380> making<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.920> another<00:01:53.850> video<00:01:54.030> which

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
gonna be making a another video which

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
gonna be making a another video which
will<00:01:54.540> explain<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.170> more<00:01:55.409> depth<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
will explain it in more depth and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.319 
will explain it in more depth and
actually<00:01:56.280> show<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.490> piece<00:01:56.759> by<00:01:56.939> piece<00:01:56.969> how<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
actually show you piece by piece how to

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.030 
actually show you piece by piece how to
build<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.750> over<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.890> will

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
build that over there and you will

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.950 
build that over there and you will
understand<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> completely<00:02:00.299> if<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:00.600> new

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
understand it completely if you're new

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.899 
understand it completely if you're new
anyway<00:02:01.619> let's<00:02:01.829> turn<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> song<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
anyway let's turn the song and as you

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
anyway let's turn the song and as you
can<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.750> same<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:04.170> what<00:02:04.320> was

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
can see it's just the same as what was

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.990 
can see it's just the same as what was
over<00:02:04.619> there

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
over there

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.350 
over there
set<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.570> wall<00:02:05.780> structure<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:07.280> obviously<00:02:08.030> an

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
set in a wall structure and obviously an

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.020 
set in a wall structure and obviously an
unbreakable<00:02:08.810> wall<00:02:09.170> sadly<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.520> can<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:10.850> go

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
unbreakable wall sadly you can just go

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
unbreakable wall sadly you can just go
around<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.510> go<00:02:11.690> under<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.080> break<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.320> pistons

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
around it go under it break the pistons

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.310 
around it go under it break the pistons
whatever<00:02:13.220> use<00:02:13.490> TNT<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.210> know<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:14.780> not<00:02:14.960> retarded

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
whatever use TNT I know I'm not retarded

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.350 
whatever use TNT I know I'm not retarded
I<00:02:15.710> remember<00:02:16.610> back<00:02:16.760> when<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.970> used<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.210> make

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
I remember back when I used to make

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.090 
I remember back when I used to make
videos<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.870> people<00:02:17.990> posted<00:02:18.470> some<00:02:18.650> really<00:02:18.920> do

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
videos and people posted some really do

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.630 
videos and people posted some really do
p<00:02:19.280> comments<00:02:19.700> about<00:02:19.790> TMT<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:22.010> understand

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
p comments about TMT so we understand

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.300 
p comments about TMT so we understand
you<00:02:22.820> can<00:02:22.970> use<00:02:23.150> TNT<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.840> things<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:24.290> this<00:02:24.500> but

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
you can use TNT on things like this but

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.949 
you can use TNT on things like this but
anyway<00:02:25.550> here<00:02:25.910> we<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.450> main<00:02:26.630> feature

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
anyway here we have the main feature

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.570 
anyway here we have the main feature
which<00:02:27.320> is<00:02:27.470> actually<00:02:27.860> slightly<00:02:28.130> more

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
which is actually slightly more

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.280 
which is actually slightly more
difficult<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.209> use<00:02:29.240> TNT<00:02:29.780> on<00:02:29.900> because

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
difficult to use TNT on because

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.800 
difficult to use TNT on because
basically<00:02:31.250> once<00:02:31.760> you're<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.060> survival<00:02:32.390> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
basically once you're in survival and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.750 
basically once you're in survival and
you're<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.380> there<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.890> are<00:02:34.070> stuck<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.490> there

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
you're in there you are stuck in there

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.940 
you're in there you are stuck in there
for<00:02:34.940> good<00:02:34.970> unless<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.600> have<00:02:35.780> TNT<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.680> lot

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
for good unless you have TNT and a lot

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.729 
for good unless you have TNT and a lot
of<00:02:36.980> luck<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.390> basically<00:02:38.780> what<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.140> have<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.380> we

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
of luck so basically what we have is we

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.630 
of luck so basically what we have is we
have<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.220> prison<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:42.500> uses<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.040> same<00:02:43.070> thing

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
have a prison and it uses the same thing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.780 
have a prison and it uses the same thing
we<00:02:43.850> had<00:02:44.030> over<00:02:44.270> there<00:02:44.360> except<00:02:44.750> repeated<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
we had over there except repeated and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.949 
we had over there except repeated and
it's<00:02:46.790> kind<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.120> hard<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> explain<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.780> I'm<00:02:47.840> just

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
it's kind of hard to explain so I'm just

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.650 
it's kind of hard to explain so I'm just
gonna<00:02:48.050> turn<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.530> stuff<00:02:49.250> on<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.700> I<00:02:50.390> know<00:02:50.450> it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
gonna turn this stuff on and I know it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.100 
gonna turn this stuff on and I know it
looks<00:02:50.840> kind<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.140> conflicts<00:02:52.010> but<00:02:52.840> it's<00:02:53.840> really

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
looks kind of conflicts but it's really

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.990 
looks kind of conflicts but it's really
not<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.290> simple<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:55.010> mean<00:02:55.190> really<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.820> that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
not that simple I mean really not that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.790 
not that simple I mean really not that
difficult<00:02:56.270> when<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:56.750> get<00:02:56.870> into<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.560> and

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
difficult when you get into it more and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.040 
difficult when you get into it more and
I'm<00:02:58.610> sure<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.850> guys<00:02:58.910> will<00:02:59.180> realize<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.570> so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
I'm sure you guys will realize that so

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.260 
I'm sure you guys will realize that so
let<00:03:00.590> me<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:00.800> do<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> demonstration<00:03:01.190> I'll<00:03:02.120> just

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
let me just do a demonstration I'll just

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.140 
let me just do a demonstration I'll just
jump<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.660> here<00:03:02.950> sit<00:03:03.950> my<00:03:04.070> game-mode<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.820> zero

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
jump in here sit my game-mode to zero

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.570 
jump in here sit my game-mode to zero
and<00:03:05.420> as<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.500> can<00:03:06.620> see<00:03:12.100> there<00:03:13.100> we<00:03:13.190> go

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
and as you can see there we go

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.810 
and as you can see there we go
so<00:03:14.150> as<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.470> completely<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.489> old

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
so as you can see it is completely a old

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.630 
so as you can see it is completely a old
I<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.060> get<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:17.930> whole<00:03:18.230> wouldn't<00:03:18.890> be<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.190> real

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
I can get that whole wouldn't be a real

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.250 
I can get that whole wouldn't be a real
game<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:23.510> that's<00:03:23.630> not<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.930> point

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
game but that's not the point

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.520 
game but that's not the point
let's<00:03:24.380> try<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.769> get<00:03:24.860> out<00:03:25.010> again<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:27.170> you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
let's try and get out again so as you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.390 
let's try and get out again so as you
can<00:03:27.650> state<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.480> cannot<00:03:29.480> do<00:03:29.780> anything<00:03:30.739> in<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
can state I cannot do anything in the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.449 
can state I cannot do anything in the
slightest<00:03:32.030> take<00:03:32.690> anything<00:03:33.590> in<00:03:33.890> this<00:03:33.980> world<00:03:34.220> I

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
slightest take anything in this world I

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.800 
slightest take anything in this world I
am<00:03:35.079> absolutely<00:03:36.079> 100%<00:03:36.230> stuck<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.370> here

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
am absolutely 100% stuck in here

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.060 
am absolutely 100% stuck in here
wait<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:39.019> you're<00:03:39.260> stuck<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.620> there<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.829> can't

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
wait if you're stuck in there you can't

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.500 
wait if you're stuck in there you can't
even<00:03:40.130> kill<00:03:40.459> yourself<00:03:40.610> unless<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.209> run<00:03:41.329> out<00:03:41.480> of

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
even kill yourself unless you run out of

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.680 
even kill yourself unless you run out of
food<00:03:41.750> will<00:03:41.959> have<00:03:42.110> liable<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.610> it's<00:03:44.480> pretty

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
food will have liable so it's pretty

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.080 
food will have liable so it's pretty
cool<00:03:44.959> in<00:03:45.079> my<00:03:45.200> opinion<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:46.190> not<00:03:46.459> perfect

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
cool in my opinion and it's not perfect

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.600 
cool in my opinion and it's not perfect
like<00:03:47.239> if<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.200> had<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.280> could<00:03:49.340> probably

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
like if you had to you could probably

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.250 
like if you had to you could probably
place<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.450> if<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.690> were<00:03:50.780> fast<00:03:51.049> enough

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
place it and if you were fast enough

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.819 
place it and if you were fast enough
place<00:03:52.130> a<00:03:52.280> redstone<00:03:52.430> torch<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:53.180> ignite<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.900> but

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
place a redstone torch and ignite it but

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.250 
place a redstone torch and ignite it but
even<00:03:55.459> what<00:03:55.850> are<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.030> chances<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.540> someone

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
even what are the chances of someone

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.360 
even what are the chances of someone
don't<00:03:59.260> even<00:04:01.349> anyway<00:04:02.349> let<00:04:02.530> me<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.709> get<00:04:03.099> out<00:04:03.189> of

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
don't even anyway let me just get out of

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.530 
don't even anyway let me just get out of

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
understand where it's gonna go throw a

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.759 
understand where it's gonna go throw a
piece<00:04:16.090> by<00:04:16.299> piece<00:04:16.329> so<00:04:17.229> really<00:04:17.530> get<00:04:17.680> an

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
piece by piece so really get an

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.289 
piece by piece so really get an
understanding<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:19.060> should<00:04:19.239> be

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
understanding of it and that should be

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.819 
understanding of it and that should be
enough<00:04:19.389> for<00:04:19.690> those<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:19.989> who<00:04:20.139> have<00:04:20.410> used<00:04:20.650> or

will<00:04:24.580> be<00:04:24.639> another<00:04:24.910> tutorial<00:04:25.210> coming<00:04:25.570> soon

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
will be another tutorial coming soon

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.590 
will be another tutorial coming soon
anyway<00:04:27.190> what<00:04:27.699> we<00:04:27.789> have<00:04:27.970> here<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.419> same

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
anyway what we have here is the same

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.240 
anyway what we have here is the same
clock<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.050> had<00:04:29.169> before<00:04:29.530> if<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.889> don't

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
clock we had before if you don't

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.680 
clock we had before if you don't
understand<00:04:30.669> how<00:04:30.729> these<00:04:30.880> work<00:04:31.150> then<00:04:31.449> just

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
understand how these work then just

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.170 
understand how these work then just
either<00:04:32.260> google<00:04:32.889> it<00:04:33.010> or<00:04:33.250> go<00:04:33.639> into<00:04:33.760> a<00:04:33.910> flower

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
either google it or go into a flower

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.730 
either google it or go into a flower
will<00:04:34.389> like<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:34.960> just<00:04:34.990> play<00:04:35.320> around<00:04:35.470> with

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
will like this and just play around with

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.560 
will like this and just play around with
them<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.250> can<00:04:36.370> just<00:04:36.520> copy<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:36.880> here<00:04:37.030> pause<00:04:37.389> the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
them you can just copy it here pause the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.990 
them you can just copy it here pause the
video<00:04:37.810> here<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.080> copy<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.560> anyway<00:04:39.460> what

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
video here and copy it anyway what

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.670 
video here and copy it anyway what
happens<00:04:40.389> is<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.720> these<00:04:41.080> branching<00:04:41.560> out

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
happens is we have these branching out

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.129 
happens is we have these branching out
now<00:04:42.010> these<00:04:42.310> go<00:04:42.639> to<00:04:42.699> each<00:04:42.910> individual<00:04:43.539> section

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
now these go to each individual section

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.200 
now these go to each individual section
of<00:04:44.320> 4<00:04:44.560> by<00:04:44.680> 4<00:04:44.949> Pistons<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.639> these<00:04:45.820> Pistons

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
of 4 by 4 Pistons and these Pistons

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.300 
of 4 by 4 Pistons and these Pistons
obviously<00:04:46.630> go<00:04:46.780> back<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.139> forth<00:04:47.350> so<00:04:48.160> what<00:04:48.250> you

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
obviously go back and forth so what you

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.250 
obviously go back and forth so what you
can<00:04:48.430> see<00:04:48.639> here<00:04:48.669> is<00:04:48.940> basically<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.720> same<00:04:49.900> thing

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
can see here is basically the same thing

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.250 
can see here is basically the same thing
as<00:04:50.380> what<00:04:50.560> we<00:04:50.650> had<00:04:50.800> over<00:04:51.070> there<00:04:51.389> except<00:04:52.389> what

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
as what we had over there except what

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.100 
as what we had over there except what
for<00:04:53.680> persons<00:04:54.100> instead<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.550> 3<00:04:54.789> and<00:04:55.030> they're<00:04:55.990> all

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
for persons instead of 3 and they're all

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.050 
for persons instead of 3 and they're all
connected<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> one<00:04:56.860> clock<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.940> do

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
connected to the one clock and to do

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.750 
connected to the one clock and to do
that<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.419> just<00:04:59.039> obviously<00:05:00.039> went<00:05:00.310> around<00:05:00.580> and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
that we just obviously went around and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.810 
that we just obviously went around and
connected<00:05:01.180> them<00:05:01.270> simple<00:05:01.930> simple<00:05:02.470> stuff<00:05:02.820> now

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
connected them simple simple stuff now

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.089 
connected them simple simple stuff now
blowing<00:05:04.270> on<00:05:04.479> top<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.900> where<00:05:05.530> it<00:05:05.650> gets<00:05:05.830> slightly

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
blowing on top is where it gets slightly

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.000 
blowing on top is where it gets slightly
different<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:07.690> thing<00:05:07.720> on<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.289> bottom<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.949> I

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
different the thing on the bottom that I

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.740 
different the thing on the bottom that I
did<00:05:09.310> you<00:05:09.430> can<00:05:09.669> do<00:05:09.820> more<00:05:09.970> efficiently<00:05:10.389> just

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
did you can do more efficiently just

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.980 
did you can do more efficiently just
sadly<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:12.250> couldn't<00:05:13.000> go<00:05:13.090> any<00:05:13.240> lowest<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.810> had

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
sadly I couldn't go any lowest so I had

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.839 
sadly I couldn't go any lowest so I had
to<00:05:14.080> do<00:05:14.199> it<00:05:14.289> the<00:05:14.380> way<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.500> do<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.889> and<00:05:15.099> I<00:05:15.490> also<00:05:15.639> want

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
to do it the way I do it and I also want

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.909 
to do it the way I do it and I also want
to<00:05:15.880> point<00:05:16.090> out<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.599> all<00:05:17.229> of<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.500> Redstone<00:05:17.889> I

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
to point out that all of the Redstone I

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.700 
to point out that all of the Redstone I
do<00:05:18.070> was<00:05:18.430> like<00:05:18.910> stuff<00:05:19.840> that<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.139> just<00:05:20.320> figure<00:05:20.650> out

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
do was like stuff that I just figure out

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.170 
do was like stuff that I just figure out
myself<00:05:20.919> I<00:05:21.250> don't<00:05:21.310> really<00:05:21.520> go<00:05:21.699> and<00:05:21.849> look<00:05:22.000> at<00:05:22.090> all

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
myself I don't really go and look at all

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.050 
myself I don't really go and look at all
those<00:05:22.270> tutorials<00:05:22.780> I'm<00:05:22.930> like<00:05:23.080> crazy<00:05:24.060> redstone

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
those tutorials I'm like crazy redstone

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.629 
those tutorials I'm like crazy redstone
stuff<00:05:25.270> because<00:05:25.750> I<00:05:25.900> don't<00:05:25.960> yeah<00:05:26.530> I<00:05:26.860> don't<00:05:27.550> know

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
stuff because I don't yeah I don't know

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.300 
stuff because I don't yeah I don't know
I'm<00:05:27.940> too<00:05:28.150> stupid<00:05:28.479> but<00:05:29.349> in<00:05:29.470> any<00:05:29.560> way<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:29.919> look

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
I'm too stupid but in any way and look

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.620 
I'm too stupid but in any way and look
basically<00:05:30.490> this<00:05:30.789> goes<00:05:31.000> up<00:05:31.180> here<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.449> these

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
basically this goes up here and these

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.450 
basically this goes up here and these
just<00:05:31.810> power<00:05:32.050> these<00:05:32.199> Pistons<00:05:32.650> on<00:05:32.800> top<00:05:33.070> that's

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
just power these Pistons on top that's

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.570 
just power these Pistons on top that's
simple<00:05:33.940> use<00:05:34.210> redstone<00:05:34.690> on<00:05:34.840> top<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.860> just<00:05:36.370> get

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
simple use redstone on top and just get

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.689 
simple use redstone on top and just get
that<00:05:36.849> redstone<00:05:37.180> trail<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.960> come<00:05:38.080> up<00:05:38.169> here<00:05:38.699> and

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
that redstone trail to come up here and

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.490 
that redstone trail to come up here and
now<00:05:39.849> downstairs<00:05:40.180> will<00:05:40.780> take<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.139> down<00:05:41.289> there

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
now downstairs will take you down there

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.330 
now downstairs will take you down there
now<00:05:41.650> basically<00:05:42.520> we<00:05:42.880> have<00:05:43.620> this<00:05:44.620> torch<00:05:44.889> here<00:05:44.979> to

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
now basically we have this torch here to

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.909 
now basically we have this torch here to
invert<00:05:45.669> it<00:05:45.699> so<00:05:46.150> that's<00:05:47.050> why<00:05:47.139> happens<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.590> all

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
invert it so that's why happens is all

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:48.600 
invert it so that's why happens is all
my<00:05:48.039> phone's<00:05:48.280> ringing

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
my phone's ringing

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.870 
my phone's ringing
awesome<00:05:49.120> I'm<00:05:49.539> not<00:05:49.599> gonna<00:05:49.780> go<00:05:49.990> on<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.260> that

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
awesome I'm not gonna go on to that

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.520 
awesome I'm not gonna go on to that
basically<00:05:51.880> we<00:05:52.000> have<00:05:52.180> redstone<00:05:52.750> lamps<00:05:53.320> here

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
basically we have redstone lamps here

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.790 
basically we have redstone lamps here
and<00:05:53.830> these<00:05:55.229> repeaters<00:05:56.229> going<00:05:56.500> into<00:05:56.680> this

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
and these repeaters going into this

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.529 
and these repeaters going into this
block<00:05:57.070> will<00:05:57.310> unpause<00:05:57.729> that<00:05:57.970> because<00:05:58.240> we<00:05:58.360> have

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
block will unpause that because we have

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.050 
block will unpause that because we have
another<00:05:58.780> torch<00:05:59.080> up<00:05:59.320> there<00:05:59.530> and<00:05:59.889> they'll<00:06:00.820> also

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
another torch up there and they'll also

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.649 
another torch up there and they'll also
unpause<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:02.740> let<00:06:03.400> me<00:06:03.490> show<00:06:04.150> you<00:06:04.210> that<00:06:04.270> see

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
unpause it let me show you that see

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.290 
unpause it let me show you that see
there<00:06:04.840> on<00:06:04.960> all<00:06:05.169> unpowered<00:06:05.560> down<00:06:05.800> there<00:06:06.010> and

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
there on all unpowered down there and

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.820 
there on all unpowered down there and
these<00:06:07.300> will<00:06:07.539> power<00:06:07.750> these<00:06:07.960> Pistons<00:06:08.409> on<00:06:08.560> top

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
these will power these Pistons on top

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.860 
these will power these Pistons on top
now<00:06:09.099> these<00:06:09.280> this<00:06:09.700> does<00:06:09.969> actually<00:06:10.210> work

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
now these this does actually work

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.380 
now these this does actually work
of<00:06:11.130> weirdly<00:06:12.130> because<00:06:12.550> these<00:06:12.730> will<00:06:13.030> trigger

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
of weirdly because these will trigger

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.690 
of weirdly because these will trigger
slightly<00:06:13.990> after<00:06:14.170> these<00:06:14.560> ones<00:06:14.830> will<00:06:15.070> so<00:06:15.520> looks

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
slightly after these ones will so looks

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.950 
slightly after these ones will so looks
a<00:06:15.760> bit<00:06:15.790> weird<00:06:15.910> but<00:06:16.210> it<00:06:16.330> really<00:06:16.540> doesn't<00:06:16.840> make<00:06:16.900> a

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
a bit weird but it really doesn't make a

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.240 
a bit weird but it really doesn't make a
difference<00:06:17.050> if<00:06:17.560> you<00:06:17.680> were<00:06:17.710> to<00:06:17.950> make<00:06:18.070> it

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
difference if you were to make it

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.770 
difference if you were to make it
perfect<00:06:18.640> then<00:06:18.820> go<00:06:18.940> look<00:06:19.120> up<00:06:19.270> how<00:06:19.420> to<00:06:19.450> do<00:06:19.660> this

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
perfect then go look up how to do this

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.510 
perfect then go look up how to do this
properly<00:06:20.020> I<00:06:20.350> know<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:20.950> if<00:06:21.070> you<00:06:21.160> have<00:06:21.310> one

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
properly I know that if you have one

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.430 
properly I know that if you have one
more<00:06:21.670> block<00:06:21.910> down<00:06:22.210> than<00:06:22.390> you<00:06:22.480> can<00:06:22.750> do<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.140> a<00:06:23.260> lot

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
more block down than you can do it a lot

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.440 
more block down than you can do it a lot
better<00:06:23.650> than<00:06:23.740> this<00:06:23.950> but<00:06:24.190> anyway<00:06:24.520> that's

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
better than this but anyway that's

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.300 
better than this but anyway that's
enough<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.780> that<00:06:25.840> basically<00:06:26.830> that's<00:06:27.040> how<00:06:27.250> you

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
enough of that basically that's how you

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.250 
enough of that basically that's how you
build<00:06:27.490> it<00:06:27.730> this<00:06:28.210> was<00:06:28.420> really<00:06:28.750> just<00:06:28.870> meant<00:06:29.140> to

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
build it this was really just meant to

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.620 
build it this was really just meant to
be<00:06:29.410> a<00:06:29.440> you<00:06:30.310> know<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.430> concept<00:06:30.880> idea<00:06:31.330> for<00:06:31.540> those

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
be a you know a concept idea for those

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.270 
be a you know a concept idea for those
of<00:06:31.840> you<00:06:32.020> who<00:06:32.230> are<00:06:32.470> looking<00:06:32.710> for<00:06:33.130> something

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
of you who are looking for something
