people or sorry environments from the
main<00:01:38.580> game<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.179> I<00:01:40.110> don't<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
main game and I don't really have a

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.339 
main game and I don't really have a
problem<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.479> but<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.840> does<00:01:43.020> give<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
problem with that but it does give you

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.749 
problem with that but it does give you
the<00:01:43.380> sort<00:01:43.709> of<00:01:43.800> been<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.520> done<00:01:44.849> that<00:01:44.880> field

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
the sort of been there done that field

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.760 
the sort of been there done that field
so<00:01:47.759> uh<00:01:47.789> now<00:01:48.360> basically<00:01:48.660> we're<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.679> gonna

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so uh now basically we're just gonna

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.139 
so uh now basically we're just gonna
give<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.069> try<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.610> my<00:01:50.880> first

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
give this a try this is my first

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:26.949 
give this a try this is my first
playthrough<00:01:51.599> and<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.819> guess<00:01:53.819> here<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.119> go

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.830 

so<00:02:27.760> one<00:02:28.760> thing<00:02:28.939> I<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.090> notice<00:02:29.329> about<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:29.780> is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so one thing I do notice about this is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.750 
so one thing I do notice about this is
it<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.230> very<00:02:30.980> sort<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.819> close-minded<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
it is very sort of close-minded and it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.949 
it is very sort of close-minded and it
really<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.390> kind<00:02:35.569> of<00:02:35.599> feels<00:02:35.780> like<00:02:35.900> a

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
really just kind of feels like a

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.140 
really just kind of feels like a
rehashing<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.680> what<00:02:37.489> we<00:02:37.579> did<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.060> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
rehashing of what we did in the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.599 
rehashing of what we did in the
single-player<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.680> mean<00:02:39.859> if<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.459> like

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
single-player and I mean if you like

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.729 
single-player and I mean if you like
Bioshock<00:02:41.239> 2<00:02:41.510> you're<00:02:42.079> not<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.500> because

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
Bioshock 2 you're not like this because

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.110 
Bioshock 2 you're not like this because
I<00:02:42.890> mean<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.219> really<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.579> just<00:02:43.609> more<00:02:43.969> of<00:02:44.090> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
I mean it really is just more of the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.610 
I mean it really is just more of the
same

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
same

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.259 
same
I<00:02:45.650> will<00:02:46.280> admit<00:02:46.579> though<00:02:46.790> what<00:02:47.060> kind<00:02:47.239> of

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
I will admit though what kind of

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.000 
I will admit though what kind of
disappoints<00:02:47.780> me<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.469> protective

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
disappoints me is the protective

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.209 
disappoints me is the protective
sections<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.969> Bioshock<00:02:50.389> 2<00:02:50.629> where

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
sections in Bioshock 2 where

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.679 
sections in Bioshock 2 where
unfortunately<00:02:52.219> the<00:02:52.760> worst<00:02:52.939> part<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:53.389> the<00:02:53.510> game

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
unfortunately the worst part of the game

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.890 
unfortunately the worst part of the game
and<00:02:54.049> so<00:02:54.829> to<00:02:54.889> make<00:02:55.129> a<00:02:55.159> whole<00:02:55.430> VLC<00:02:56.090> based<00:02:56.480> around

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
and so to make a whole VLC based around

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.220 
and so to make a whole VLC based around
that<00:02:58.480> Wow<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.720> don't<00:02:59.870> know<00:03:01.389> but<00:03:02.389> there<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.049> some

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that Wow I don't know but there is some

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.119 
that Wow I don't know but there is some
achievements<00:03:03.799> there<00:03:04.609> is<00:03:06.010> there's<00:03:07.010> some

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
achievements there is there's some

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.280 
achievements there is there's some
little<00:03:07.310> doodads<00:03:07.760> extra<00:03:08.359> things<00:03:08.569> unlock<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.230> I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
little doodads extra things unlock and I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.839 
little doodads extra things unlock and I
guess<00:03:09.650> if<00:03:09.889> you're<00:03:10.069> into<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.400> sort<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.790> thing

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
guess if you're into that sort of thing

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.110 
guess if you're into that sort of thing
you'll<00:03:11.379> go<00:03:12.379> like<00:03:12.560> this

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.089 

so<00:03:18.120> at<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.750> end<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.019> trial<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.680> get<00:03:19.920> your

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
so at the end of the trial you get your

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.520 
so at the end of the trial you get your
results<00:03:20.359> how<00:03:21.359> well<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.689> did<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.079> apparently

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
results how well you did and apparently

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.990 
results how well you did and apparently
I<00:03:22.560> didn't<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:22.980> very<00:03:23.010> well<00:03:23.250> you'll<00:03:23.579> see<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> get

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
I didn't do very well you'll see I get

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.929 
I didn't do very well you'll see I get
to<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.569> get<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.049> see<00:03:25.439> Ryan<00:03:25.829> King<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.670> one
