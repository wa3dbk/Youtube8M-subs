00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 this would not be considered as 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.200
 undue touching in public life 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.019
 but depends depends today 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:35.300
 real of people who need a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.129
 room 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.350
 also local security allows that 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.960
 type of acts publicly is something else 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.960
 I do not understand why he feels the mat 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:59.019
 of the nightclubs 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.810
 Trujillo Mr. Director 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.810
 I want to see that again 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.820
 respective there are charges because the schedule 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.820
 but you know what my husband 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.049
 and I was not I believe no thanks 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.560
 to see if a question was asked if there was 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.800
 have you ever danced to a disco or 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.460
 do not 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.460
 Never 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.860
 because people can live with freedom 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.860
 can do anything 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.530
 it seems a proper behavior looks 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.330
 who is enjoying 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.790
 I do not know is , if a man gives a kiss 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.759
 another man who has for the whole world is 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.910
 scandalizes but if a woman dances or 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.720
 better said publicly by little and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.860
 copula is a party in a nightclub 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.860
 everything is beautiful 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.300
 which it is the melissa oie as puts you 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.300
 to the tail 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.939
 because with the gap is those in which 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:35.019
 families remember reggaeton 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.590
 that was sticking and it was too much but 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.590
 now yes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.900
 clear to everyone too 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.879
 that you wish you can not wait for 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.879
 get to that 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.580
 it's a goodbye and iu but if I had 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:17.020
 girlfriend 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:19.540
 and that 's how one step is forcing us 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.580
 no one she is happy enjoying more 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.470
 well I see it a little until reluctant to 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:30.160
 beginning of the story with the work for 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.650
 start is an obvious renzo appears minor 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.100
 rodrigo cuba now they have sent me for the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.100
 inter 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:53.709
 it's still little man have kept 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:58.560
 all of that has said that they have had to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:01.560
 letting go through that does not affect me or 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.560
 chocolate 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.660
 I think he needs a little bit of 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.110
 chocolate as to separate a bit the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.440
 situation 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:18.560
 also life too much for lake 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:21.350
 A little bit of truth 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.550
 it seems strong to me and not just to me 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.550
 the people behind the camera 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.430
 we will do everything we will do everything everything 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.780
 we will do everything let's leave it in silence 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.440
 up show 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.440
 Water 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.240
 good 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.240
 ah 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.740
 in the mouth what the listeners say 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.740
 listen a little 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.200
 you do not hear that there is no sound 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.510
 yes it seems very good that I love him but 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.510
 that's fourth quarter 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.800
 these images of melissa and the truth of 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:44.460
 objective tries to be objective of two 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:49.890
 goals but you're not alone 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.890
 is the battle cry too 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.729
 this has been subject to is the truth 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.729
 so everything happens everything you know 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.030
 what I made that label 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.030
 I would like to propose to open 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.000
 is to dance 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.000
 in the sun but it seems that you have 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.610
 I have 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:44.389
 because you say you are not surprised that 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:46.399
