00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.230
 always cool 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.199
 if I'm flexible pike registration it is 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.789
 very important I know I repeat 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.409
 to stop my eyes 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.809
 I have just noticed this 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.609
 small channel we this bridge the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.229
 is significantly narrower and we have 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.300
 put some currents on it into which pumps 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.829
 run back there and where that is 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.149
 narrowed naturally increases 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.100
 the flow that exploits the pike 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.879
 definitely out because also a lot of food 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.039
 is washed up 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.629
 and there is his ideal no cologne 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.519
 to deposit fish at the bottom I have it 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.530
 anyway, do not and bonus fish 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.200
 legal poles but then it is too 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.720
 important that you have a fish active 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.700
 leads vertically or thrown 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.530
 the field here again everything flat and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.789
 Mondays are such weird boards the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.280
 hang there between the planks and stuff 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.300
 turned buddy stefan gratzer posen or 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 tore off 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.049
 so if I have an assembly now 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.149
 just do not always get drunk 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.009
 reason and so offers the red eye 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.299
 very important swimming bubble bribed 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.679
 so that he keeps upright , yes, yes 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.659
 may be that big red-eye now 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.119
 a back 1 here in front 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.090
 so I can strike relatively fast 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.390
 if I should get along and go 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.390
 it's 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.760
 there is a big risk I throw 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.840
 not in the dense to the planks in there 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.440
 the lower back but I have 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.360
 Just pull in front of it 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.980
 we must therefore still position and have 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.330
 because of it just drifting by itself 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.330
 rest will do the flow for me 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.350
 the wind supported plans still so 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.080
 a little wind here too, very nice 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.480
 down there goes the pose of 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.140
 Stefan under the bridge the profit one 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.140
 other side of 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.160
 further air masses anticipates 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.680
 is 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.150
 for the second time worked but the the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.670
 We let off steam 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 I have just 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.760
 Now I gather a bit 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 I never get it fast 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.480
 I'll never put that on and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.770
 let's say again because that can 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.750
 sometimes a fish touched and 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.690
 has more animated animate again 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.980
 So do not give up immediately 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.120
 withdraw from markus cancel again 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.310
 leave there I already have a lot 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.739
 caught bonus fish 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:18.250
 now I catch up with him and even Nicola 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:20.140
 fisher you had to look up to yes 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.370
 and I first thought he wanted the races 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.819
 I took it out 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.840
 promptly but again you have to bitten 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.470
 sometimes also a bit doctor 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.519
 that's just what makes the appeal that 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.230
 Beautiful one is always fishing 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.090
 it does not even have to be adaptable 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.440
 many nature or others think after 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.790
 many art basements is stopped 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.260
 of course, the color too 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.840
 Change times to change the pattern 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.269
 must be more aggressive my quiet nature 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.100
 back to her mother her pore montage 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.850
 line up and wait until I 'm beautiful 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.360
 I just say silly 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.260
 You also have to be flexible 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.260
 Now I'm trying for the third time 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.140
 much better though 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.740
 at least dedicate themselves 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.710
 Where 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.560
 difficult to cash but do as I said 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.010
 what crazy thing and that has 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.010
 also cut 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.910
 there is still one 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.340
 aptly under the bridge from the 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.350
 flow does not always have to 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.810
 but the monsters are here 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.120
 understandable about list of convinced 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.820
 me fishing that right 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.180
 hobby for me is good little dax yet 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.180

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:33.179
 just demolished outside 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.980
 from the 17th 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.980
 I can feel whole 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.210
 I will not be here 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.530

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.960
