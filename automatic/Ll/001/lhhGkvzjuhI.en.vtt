00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
consistent my way but you could do

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.460 
consistent my way but you could do

more scales draw with my royal magical
library<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:08.730> eventually<00:03:09.060> you're

probably drawn to rescue hamster rescue

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.580 
probably drawn to rescue hamster rescue
hamster<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:12.090> basically<00:03:12.450> use<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.439> get<00:03:13.560> a

hamster you basically use it you get a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.520 
hamster you basically use it you get a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400

summon or a pendulum scale card which

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.780 
summon or a pendulum scale card which
also<00:03:58.109> gave<00:03:58.379> you<00:03:58.530> counter<00:03:58.919> to<00:03:59.069> add<00:03:59.190> another<00:03:59.549> one

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790

to<00:04:00.000> give<00:04:00.389> you<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.569> third<00:04:00.840> counter<00:04:01.169> so<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.319> can

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
to give you a third counter so you can

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.199 
to give you a third counter so you can
basically<00:04:01.590> three<00:04:02.310> counters<00:04:02.699> off<00:04:02.909> just

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
basically three counters off just

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.530 
basically three counters off just
Phoenix<00:04:04.489> which<00:04:05.489> lets<00:04:05.729> you<00:04:05.849> draw<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.269> then<00:04:06.359> get

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
Phoenix which lets you draw and then get

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.830 
Phoenix which lets you draw and then get
another<00:04:06.629> scale<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.109> basically<00:04:08.329> can<00:04:09.329> usually

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
another scale I basically can usually

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.140 
another scale I basically can usually
get<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.319> quite<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.590> few<00:04:10.680> drawers<00:04:11.010> off<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.549> if

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
get it quite a few drawers off that if

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.479 
get it quite a few drawers off that if
you<00:04:12.540> have<00:04:12.659> multiple<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.769> field<00:04:14.010> spells<00:04:14.310> in

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
you have multiple of the field spells in

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.620 
you have multiple of the field spells in
your<00:04:14.609> hand<00:04:16.489> but<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.669> deck<00:04:17.849> is<00:04:18.060> very

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
your hand but the deck is very

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.060 
your hand but the deck is very
consistent<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.409> think<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.859> most

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
consistent I think it's the most

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.920 
consistent I think it's the most
consistent<00:04:20.489> exodia<00:04:21.180> deck<00:04:21.239> I've<00:04:21.510> ever<00:04:21.690> seen

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
consistent exodia deck I've ever seen

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.649 
consistent exodia deck I've ever seen
obviously<00:04:22.200> going<00:04:22.800> into<00:04:23.190> Randall<00:04:23.659> really

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
obviously going into Randall really

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.560 
obviously going into Randall really
helps<00:04:24.960> late<00:04:25.289> game<00:04:25.560> as<00:04:25.770> well<00:04:26.729> as<00:04:26.969> if<00:04:27.300> you

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
helps late game as well as if you

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.330 
helps late game as well as if you
pendulum<00:04:28.020> summon<00:04:28.320> two<00:04:28.470> royal<00:04:28.890> magical

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
pendulum summon two royal magical

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.010 
pendulum summon two royal magical
libraries<00:04:29.760> it's<00:04:29.970> not<00:04:30.120> necessary<00:04:30.690> but<00:04:30.900> it

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
libraries it's not necessary but it

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.750 
libraries it's not necessary but it
helps<00:04:33.590> obviously<00:04:34.590> your<00:04:34.770> turns<00:04:35.070> take<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> very

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
helps obviously your turns take a very

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.320 
helps obviously your turns take a very
long<00:04:35.850> time<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:37.340> be<00:04:38.340> prepared<00:04:38.760> for<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.000> if

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
long time so be prepared for that if

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.750 
long time so be prepared for that if
you're<00:04:39.570> playing<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:40.050> deaf<00:04:40.770> pro<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.580> can

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
you're playing on deaf pro you can

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.970 
you're playing on deaf pro you can
actually<00:04:41.970> time<00:04:42.390> out<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.780> makes<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.620> run<00:04:43.830> out

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
actually time out it makes you run out

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.710 
actually time out it makes you run out
of<00:04:44.010> time<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.340> skip<00:04:44.760> your<00:04:44.940> turn<00:04:44.970> sometimes

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
of time and skip your turn sometimes

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.330 
of time and skip your turn sometimes
before<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.260> can<00:04:46.440> complete<00:04:46.650> it<00:04:46.950> I've<00:04:47.040> had<00:04:47.220> that

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
before you can complete it I've had that

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.610 
before you can complete it I've had that
happen<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.700> lot<00:04:47.850> of<00:04:48.030> times<00:04:48.270> just<00:04:49.140> before<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.410> get

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
happen a lot of times just before I get

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.600 
happen a lot of times just before I get
Exodia<00:04:50.420> but<00:04:51.420> basically<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:52.170> think<00:04:52.740> I've<00:04:52.920> gotten

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
Exodia but basically I think I've gotten

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.280 
Exodia but basically I think I've gotten
all<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.880> kinks<00:04:54.270> out<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.630> deck<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:55.080> don't

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
all the kinks out of the deck you don't

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.760 
all the kinks out of the deck you don't
um<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:57.330> doesn't<00:04:57.630> really<00:04:57.900> burn<00:04:58.260> out<00:04:58.500> ever

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
um it doesn't really burn out ever

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.950 
um it doesn't really burn out ever
anymore<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.850> used<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.210> kind<00:05:00.390> of<00:05:00.450> burnout<00:05:00.750> you'd

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
anymore it used to kind of burnout you'd

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.710 
anymore it used to kind of burnout you'd
run<00:05:01.170> out<00:05:01.200> of<00:05:01.320> targets<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:01.980> deck<00:05:02.390> but<00:05:03.390> now<00:05:03.540> I've

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
run out of targets and deck but now I've

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.420 
run out of targets and deck but now I've
kind<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:04.050> fixed<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.500> issue<00:05:04.530> with<00:05:04.980> the<00:05:05.100> pot<00:05:05.280> of

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
kind of fixed that issue with the pot of

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.300 
kind of fixed that issue with the pot of
riches<00:05:05.880> as<00:05:06.150> well<00:05:06.600> as<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.440> Durandal<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.250> the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
riches as well as the Durandal and the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.610 
riches as well as the Durandal and the
diamond<00:05:08.670> direwolf<00:05:09.180> because<00:05:09.870> basically<00:05:10.110> you

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
diamond direwolf because basically you

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.120 
diamond direwolf because basically you
this<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.790> you<00:05:12.420> can<00:05:12.600> add<00:05:12.870> from<00:05:13.500> deck<00:05:13.890> or

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
this is you can add from deck or

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.220 
this is you can add from deck or
graveyard<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.000> basically<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.600> diamond<00:05:16.020> diary

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
graveyard so basically you diamond diary

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.710 
graveyard so basically you diamond diary
your<00:05:16.530> own<00:05:16.620> pendulum<00:05:17.160> scale<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.700> that<00:05:18.570> gives

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
your own pendulum scale and that gives

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.550 
your own pendulum scale and that gives
you<00:05:18.840> three<00:05:19.200> targets<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.860> grave<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.370> add<00:05:20.520> with

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
you three targets and grave to add with

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.720 
you three targets and grave to add with
which<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.740> lot<00:05:22.890> better<00:05:23.010> than<00:05:23.310> adding<00:05:23.550> from

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
which is a lot better than adding from

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.940 
which is a lot better than adding from
your<00:05:23.880> deck<00:05:24.120> but<00:05:24.450> also<00:05:24.780> if<00:05:25.410> you<00:05:25.620> add<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.830> from

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
your deck but also if you add it from

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.440 
your deck but also if you add it from
your<00:05:26.070> deck<00:05:26.250> at<00:05:26.430> deck<00:05:26.610> then<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.120> that's<00:05:27.300> also

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
your deck at deck then so that's also

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.470 
your deck at deck then so that's also
pretty<00:05:27.690> good<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.080> it's<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.820> situational<00:05:29.820> to

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
pretty good so it's a situational to

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.450 
pretty good so it's a situational to
going<00:05:30.780> into<00:05:30.930> diamond<00:05:31.410> die<00:05:31.590> or<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.980> Durandal

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
going into diamond die or the Durandal

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.940 
going into diamond die or the Durandal
but<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.000> definitely<00:05:33.180> helps<00:05:33.720> getting<00:05:33.960> me<00:05:34.230> ftk

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
but it definitely helps getting me ftk

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.280 
but it definitely helps getting me ftk
also<00:05:35.910> evolved<00:05:36.330> ol<00:05:36.450> chain<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.930> pretty<00:05:37.110> good

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
also evolved ol chain is pretty good

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.950 
also evolved ol chain is pretty good
because<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.590> could<00:05:37.740> send<00:05:38.010> one<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.370> grave<00:05:38.550> or

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
because you could send one to grave or

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.420 
because you could send one to grave or
let's<00:05:39.960> say<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.170> got<00:05:40.410> like<00:05:40.620> five<00:05:40.890> cards<00:05:41.250> left

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
let's say you got like five cards left

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.770 
let's say you got like five cards left
in<00:05:41.550> dec<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.000> have<00:05:42.090> four<00:05:42.390> pieces<00:05:42.600> of

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
in dec and you have four pieces of

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.170 
in dec and you have four pieces of
Exodia<00:05:43.280> lavall<00:05:44.280> ball<00:05:44.460> chain<00:05:44.730> put<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.030> last

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
Exodia lavall ball chain put the last

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.270 
Exodia lavall ball chain put the last
piece<00:05:45.330> on<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.690> top<00:05:45.750> of<00:05:45.900> your<00:05:46.140> deck<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.920> and

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
piece on the top of your deck so and

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.760 
piece on the top of your deck so and
usually<00:05:48.240> you've<00:05:48.420> used<00:05:48.750> one<00:05:49.080> day<00:05:49.230> of<00:05:49.290> peace<00:05:49.560> by

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
usually you've used one day of peace by

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.430 
usually you've used one day of peace by
then<00:05:49.980> so<00:05:50.460> they<00:05:50.610> can't<00:05:50.850> otk<00:05:51.390> you<00:05:51.450> that<00:05:51.960> turn<00:05:52.200> and

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
then so they can't otk you that turn and

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.560 
then so they can't otk you that turn and
then<00:05:53.280> you<00:05:53.430> basically<00:05:53.610> just<00:05:53.910> draw<00:05:54.270> into<00:05:54.540> the

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
then you basically just draw into the

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.320 
then you basically just draw into the
last<00:05:54.840> piece<00:05:55.080> or<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.490> can<00:05:56.640> send<00:05:56.910> one<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330
