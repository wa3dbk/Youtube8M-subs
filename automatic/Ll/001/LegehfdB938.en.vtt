poking<00:01:45.659> out<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.350> completely<00:01:47.280> contained<00:01:47.850> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
poking out it's completely contained in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.940 
poking out it's completely contained in
there<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.659> gonna<00:01:48.840> slide<00:01:49.259> out<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.799> got

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
there it's not gonna slide out it's got

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.069 
there it's not gonna slide out it's got
a<00:01:49.979> nice<00:01:50.189> tight<00:01:50.640> fit<00:01:50.670> around<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> brush<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
a nice tight fit around the brush and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.899 
a nice tight fit around the brush and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
then when I want to use it you just pull

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.420 
then when I want to use it you just pull
it<00:01:53.939> out<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.630> other<00:01:54.780> direction<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.219> only

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it out the other direction and not only

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.639

is<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:56.880> brush<00:01:57.060> protected<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.439> it's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
is your brush protected but if it's

spent<00:01:58.920> some<00:01:59.130> time<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.820> these<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.180> comes

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
spent some time in one of these it comes

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
spent some time in one of these it comes
out<00:02:00.799> with<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> better<00:02:02.070> shape<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.820> another

way<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.899> use<00:02:04.049> these<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.409> when<00:02:04.590> I'm

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
way I like to use these is when I'm

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.190 
way I like to use these is when I'm
cleaning<00:02:05.189> my<00:02:05.340> brushes<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.509> have

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
certain brushes maybe ones that I've had

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.910 
certain brushes maybe ones that I've had
a<00:02:09.060> long<00:02:09.300> time

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
a long time

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.280 
a long time
or<00:02:09.979> some<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.490> those<00:02:10.610> goat<00:02:11.000> hair<00:02:11.330> bristles<00:02:12.170> you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
or some of those goat hair bristles you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.110 
or some of those goat hair bristles you
know<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.500> lighter<00:02:12.770> bristles<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.670> tend<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
know the lighter bristles that tend to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.240 
know the lighter bristles that tend to
when<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.900> watch<00:02:15.140> them<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> bristles

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
when you watch them like the bristles

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.280 
when you watch them like the bristles
start<00:02:16.370> poking<00:02:17.180> out<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.810> different<00:02:18.050> directions

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
start poking out in different directions

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.030 
start poking out in different directions
and<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:20.569> start<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> lose<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.200> shape<00:02:21.620> over

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and you start to lose the shape over

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.490 
and you start to lose the shape over
time<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.000> when<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.270> use<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.600> brush<00:02:23.900> guard<00:02:24.230> in

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
time and so when I use a brush guard in

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.180 
time and so when I use a brush guard in

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
I take even the smallest one this is the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.280 
I take even the smallest one this is the
littlest<00:02:43.160> guy<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.090> it's<00:02:44.690> fitting<00:02:45.080> right

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
littlest guy and it's fitting right

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.280 
littlest guy and it's fitting right
around<00:02:45.620> there<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.190> then<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.270> poke<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.870> right<00:02:48.170> up

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
around there and then I poke it right up

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.410 
around there and then I poke it right up
in<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.530> brush<00:02:48.709> tree<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> what's<00:02:49.940> really<00:02:50.239> neat

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
in the brush tree and what's really neat

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.000 
in the brush tree and what's really neat
about<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:50.840> is<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.350> brush<00:02:51.709> will

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
about this is that this brush will

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.310 
about this is that this brush will
completely<00:02:52.580> dry<00:02:52.850> even<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:53.780> thing<00:02:54.080> on

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
completely dry even with this thing on

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.820 
completely dry even with this thing on
it<00:02:54.530> because<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.310> open<00:02:55.940> air<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:57.019> get<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.739> your

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
it because it's open air can get to your

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.160 
it because it's open air can get to your
brush<00:02:58.190> but<00:02:58.640> it's<00:02:58.790> gonna<00:02:58.910> come<00:02:59.209> out<00:02:59.360> with<00:02:59.840> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
brush but it's gonna come out with the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.840 
brush but it's gonna come out with the
perfect<00:03:00.500> shape<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.100> if<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.340> don't<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.820> a

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
perfect shape and if you don't have a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.550 
perfect shape and if you don't have a
brush<00:03:02.180> tree<00:03:02.480> maybe<00:03:02.720> you're<00:03:02.900> cleaning<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.290> small

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
brush tree maybe you're cleaning a small

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.250 
brush tree maybe you're cleaning a small
amount<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.860> brushes<00:03:04.870> assuming<00:03:05.870> you've<00:03:05.989> got

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
amount of brushes assuming you've got

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.259 
amount of brushes assuming you've got
brush<00:03:06.890> guards<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.519> having<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.030> really

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
brush guards that are having a really

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.640 
brush guards that are having a really
tight<00:03:08.480> fit<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.840> your<00:03:08.959> brush<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.410> could<00:03:09.500> even

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
tight fit on your brush it could even

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.710 
tight fit on your brush it could even
tip<00:03:10.010> them<00:03:10.250> downward<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:11.090> just<00:03:11.239> put<00:03:11.420> them<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.630> a

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
tip them downward and just put them in a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.160 
tip them downward and just put them in a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
glass air isn't gonna circulate through

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.930 
glass air isn't gonna circulate through
that<00:03:15.470> quite<00:03:15.980> as<00:03:16.160> much<00:03:16.340> as<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.610> would<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:16.850> it

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
that quite as much as it would if it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.490 
that quite as much as it would if it
were<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.150> hanging<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.720> brush<00:03:17.930> tree<00:03:18.260> but
