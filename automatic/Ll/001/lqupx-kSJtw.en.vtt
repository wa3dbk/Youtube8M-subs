and the reason why is because i'm trying
to<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.750> how<00:00:34.020> much<00:00:34.260> length<00:00:34.770> i<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.280> retain

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to see how much length i can retain

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.700 
to see how much length i can retain
versus<00:00:36.420> having<00:00:36.739> flat<00:00:37.739> ironing<00:00:38.070> my<00:00:38.129> hair<00:00:39.710> every

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
and then the front part of my hair is

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.190 
and then the front part of my hair is
about<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.880> little<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:57.960> past<00:01:58.799> mine<00:01:59.369> or

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
about there so a little bit past mine or

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.480 
about there so a little bit past mine or
actually<00:02:01.200> i'll<00:02:01.350> say<00:02:01.649> yeah<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.189> bit<00:02:02.280> past

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
actually i'll say yeah a little bit past

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.719 
actually i'll say yeah a little bit past
my<00:02:02.729> top<00:02:03.450> lip<00:02:03.780> or<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.649> i'm<00:02:05.369> thinking

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
my top lip or so and then i'm thinking

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.270 
my top lip or so and then i'm thinking
that<00:02:05.759> maybe<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.329> i<00:02:06.659> stick<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.740> no<00:02:08.009> heat

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that maybe if i stick to this no heat

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.660 
that maybe if i stick to this no heat
thing<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> will<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.450> able<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
thing that I will be able to

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.350 
thing that I will be able to
um<00:02:11.050> get<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.230> front<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.860> my<00:02:13.160> hair<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.849> catch<00:02:14.060> up

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
um get the front of my hair to catch up

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.199 
um get the front of my hair to catch up
with<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.950> back<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.400> hair<00:02:16.700> because<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.000> lot

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
with the back of my hair because a lot

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.699 
with the back of my hair because a lot
of<00:02:17.239> times<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.690> back<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:18.020> my<00:02:18.080> hair<00:02:18.290> will<00:02:18.500> grow

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
of times the back of my hair will grow

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.790 
of times the back of my hair will grow
and<00:02:19.190> it'll<00:02:19.940> get<00:02:20.239> down<00:02:20.569> here<00:02:20.989> but<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.319> front<00:02:21.620> is

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and it'll get down here but the front is

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.979 
and it'll get down here but the front is
still<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.340> here<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.569> think<00:02:23.630> that's<00:02:23.810> because

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
still in here and I think that's because

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.030 
still in here and I think that's because
I<00:02:24.440> put<00:02:24.910> more<00:02:25.910> heat<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.870> top<00:02:27.170> then<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.709> do<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
I put more heat on the top then I do the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.020 
I put more heat on the top then I do the
back<00:02:28.190> so<00:02:28.489> that's<00:02:29.390> another<00:02:29.720> reason<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.910> yeah

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
back so that's another reason but yeah

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.759
