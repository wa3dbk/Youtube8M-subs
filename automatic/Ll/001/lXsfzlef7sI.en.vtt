00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 but 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.279
 Nicolas Sarkozy had to move to 38 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.539
 in question 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.539
 obviously as I said it was killed by a shu 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.999
 6 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.669
 so let's go for a little bit of 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.519
 in europe without a club 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.530
 with pascal 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.500
 to a goal of philippe mexes as roma 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.780
 and M 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.540
 it's a super 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.240
 it must be remembered that the file 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.569
 but you have to pay after those months 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:47.630
 I am 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.240
 he must speak 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.760
 you tell me if the bce was going to decide and act mike patton 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.620
 examples 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.289
 I got to read them video books m 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.289
 we must try to see what people think 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.160
 1 - finally never 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.640
 m 5 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.790
 pity 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.040
 weight on his part the mayor of bessan who opposes the bar 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.700
 but how to get involved so much to see what it's like 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.159
 because it's completely different like that, but here's what 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 for women in super important evening noon 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.280
 1 night 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.980
 what's more with the blade 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.030
 the belt rhinestone and others so we can say this time it's not 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.160
 super rewarding for me 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.100
 in all of Switzerland by the subject 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.000
 his belt 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 Why 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.370
 she would be too much why 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.630
 because for us she alain 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.130
 Governors of the ECB 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.360
 question of whether he agrees to change to Sylvan fire 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 armand is pretty perfect 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.890
 it's not enough 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.090
 so you have to try 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.550
 after calling parliamentarians about it vt this novel 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.050
 Saturday the vast world 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.719
 if you bought a cd with 130 dollars 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.099
 I would have 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.429
 so do not spoiler happened exactly 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.589
 in the face of drought and to make feel for years and who 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.979
 not agree on them 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.999
 and then remains to be done 5 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:27.999
 the holidays 17 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.239
