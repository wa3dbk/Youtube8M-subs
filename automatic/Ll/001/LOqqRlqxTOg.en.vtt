00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
warm you don't need to pump the gas
pedal<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.860> because<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> hasn't<00:01:20.490> been

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.149 
it's real cool like this you've got to
keep<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.880> revs<00:01:43.149> up<00:01:43.390> quite<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.720> bit<00:01:44.020> because<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
keep the revs up quite a bit because the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.219 
keep the revs up quite a bit because the
gas<00:01:45.399> has<00:01:45.729> pulled<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.420> cylinders<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.079> got
