00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:23.737
I’ve come to the mass. Once a month, last Friday.

00:00:24.404 --> 00:00:26.404
I like riding a bike.

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:32.886
Warsaw Critical Mass is a monthly parade of 
 cyclists through the streets of the city

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.739
to show that Warsaw needs a good infrastructure

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.734
because there are masses of cyclists

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.219
who want to ride their bikes everyday as comfortably 

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.633
and as safely as here during the critical mass.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.884
The mass is a protest against neglecting the cyclists

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
by the city authorities and drivers.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.000
The mass wants to make Warsaw comfortable,

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.806
nice and safe for bikers.

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:09.395
I’ve covered so many kilometers in my life

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.320
that I could circle the globe 7 times.
