00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.589
 we are in a fun garden in one of 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.180
 the largest parks of the city of Moscow and 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.610
 More precisely even pairs on dense and today 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.930
 cartoons actually in the park we are planning 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 go down to the quays there of course 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.100
 reaction of people well and in general for tests 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.830
 motik in an urban setting 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.150
 should have gone in to mode 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.150
 actually ride on steam 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.940
 Well 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.219
 well we got to the quays in 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.420
 Gorky Park and we went down with 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.420
 fun garden 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.509
 Well, now we try to quietly in the face 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.720
 sense and see what happens if 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.729

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.979
 different electric vehicles and scooters 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.540
 great videos on electro cartoons 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 Actually, I think this is the first 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.780
 implementation experiment in Russia 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.110
 electric motocycle bike paths to the park 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 bitter 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.659
 not worth seeing I drove through the cordon 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.829
 the sheet is shorter everything is cool 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.829

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.160

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.410
 electric bike we shoot about a half 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:13.220
 hours already and wanted to show how much 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 There is a charge of our cats on this 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.340
 mutation left 86 percent and on 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.190
 as powerful as 80 volts well and we wanted 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.630

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.560
 police cordon 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.140
 parkour and in general everything happened without 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.540
 accidents everyone pay attention but 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.520
