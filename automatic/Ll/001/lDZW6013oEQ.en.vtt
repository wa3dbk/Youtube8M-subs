00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.910

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.790
 like 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.410
 but that is impossible, there is only the 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.010
 an access what did you do 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.990
 Nothing 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.030
 Stop lying I do not lie We 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.890
 have not done anything you are allowed to do 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.970
 Swarm tell us nothing 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.970
 no other choice 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 if what you say was and is 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 what happened to the boy 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 is bad for all of us I'm there 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.250
 just as far as I have to just something 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.250
 done 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.710
 the water in the basin that has me 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710
 addressed 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.250
 I'm so sorry we can 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.340
 explain it is too late 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.200
 He should have protected the island 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.960
 Have you let the island and the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.220
 boys in the moon lake you have against 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.229
 many rules are violated 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.369
 We did not want that we did not want 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.860
 that the boy gets water 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.989
 boy now belongs to the island the swarm 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.660
 must disappear here 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.500
 this is our home it is not here 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.500
 more safe for us 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.880
 where should we go? 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.680
 he does not see what else 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 Maybe it'll work again 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.160
 we should get out of the dust 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.160
 maybe better protect 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.120
 everything is fine i want all right 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.100
 governed be honest 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.710
 we do not even manage to rent anymore 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.310
 for here we have probably still 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.310
 what other museums 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.490
 you mean we have to move something 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.230
 Maybe in the country 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.490
 I do like it here, giving you the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.060
 friends though 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.060
 I'm sorry sweetheart 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.860
 Alright, I have enough on anyway 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.580
 beach and the surf sounds 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.580
 credible
