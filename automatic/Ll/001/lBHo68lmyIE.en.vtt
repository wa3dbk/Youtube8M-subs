biologist told me up there around
Mosquito<00:00:43.700> Lagoon<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:44.480> back<00:00:44.840> in<00:00:45.020> 2010

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
Mosquito Lagoon is that back in 2010

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.370 
Mosquito Lagoon is that back in 2010
when<00:00:45.740> we<00:00:45.800> had<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.130> big<00:00:46.190> freeze<00:00:46.810> all<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:48.080> fish

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
when we had that big freeze all the fish

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.350 
when we had that big freeze all the fish
that<00:00:48.650> died<00:00:48.890> it<00:00:49.190> just<00:00:49.430> dumped<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:49.880> a<00:00:49.910> bunch<00:00:50.240> of

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
that died it just dumped in a bunch of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.390 
that died it just dumped in a bunch of
nutrients<00:00:50.840> into<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.110> water<00:00:51.380> and<00:00:51.650> there's<00:00:52.280> Oh

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
nutrients into the water and there's Oh

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.020 
nutrients into the water and there's Oh
plankton<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:53.030> feed<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:54.200> brown<00:00:54.440> algae

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
plankton that feed on the brown algae

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.370 
plankton that feed on the brown algae
there<00:00:56.030> was<00:00:56.180> none<00:00:56.360> left<00:00:56.600> because<00:00:56.930> they<00:00:57.079> died

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
there was none left because they died

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.740 
there was none left because they died
and<00:00:57.650> made<00:00:58.280> that<00:00:58.430> brown<00:00:58.670> algae<00:00:58.910> just<00:00:59.270> multiply

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
and made that brown algae just multiply

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.780 
and made that brown algae just multiply
and<00:00:59.870> multiply<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.950> started<00:01:01.340> feeding<00:01:01.550> on

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
and multiply and it started feeding on

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.520 
and multiply and it started feeding on
the<00:01:01.880> grass<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.450> just<00:01:02.600> choking<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.020> grass<00:01:03.230> out

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
the grass and just choking the grass out

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.950 
the grass and just choking the grass out
so<00:01:04.430> hopefully<00:01:04.640> with<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:05.150> cleaner<00:01:05.420> water<00:01:05.750> in

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
so hopefully with this cleaner water in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.380 
so hopefully with this cleaner water in
this<00:01:06.110> real<00:01:06.979> light<00:01:07.189> winter<00:01:07.850> we're<00:01:08.000> having<00:01:08.270> this
