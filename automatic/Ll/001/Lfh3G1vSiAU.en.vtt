about<00:00:05.730> Mario<00:00:06.629> Kart<00:00:14.929> now<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.049> testing<00:00:16.320> out<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
about Mario Kart now I'm testing out the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.970 
about Mario Kart now I'm testing out the
connection<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.490> Marie<00:00:17.960> because<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.380> use<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
connection for Marie because I use a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.650 
connection for Marie because I use a
wireless<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.140> that's<00:00:22.140> built<00:00:22.410> into<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.130> Wii

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
wireless and that's built into the Wii

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.250 
wireless and that's built into the Wii
she<00:00:24.890> uses<00:00:25.890> Ethernet<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.550> guess<00:00:26.990> this<00:00:27.990> hooks

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
she uses Ethernet I guess this hooks

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
she uses Ethernet I guess this hooks
right<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> back<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.720> your<00:00:31.369> as<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.759> see

right to the back of your as you can see
right<00:00:33.149> there<00:00:34.219> but<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.610> hooks<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.149> back

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
right there but that hooks to the back

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.590 
right there but that hooks to the back
runs<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:40.070> sleeve<00:00:41.070> phone<00:00:41.370> line<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.390> your

runs right sleeve phone line is your

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.950 
runs right sleeve phone line is your
Ethernet<00:00:42.690> cable<00:00:43.670> now<00:00:44.670> if<00:00:44.969> you're<00:00:45.300> using<00:00:45.570> one

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
