hello this is Logan Murphy and today

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.730 
hello this is Logan Murphy and today
we'll<00:00:02.520> be<00:00:02.659> cleaning<00:00:03.659> up<00:00:03.959> our<00:00:04.230> code<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> little

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
we'll be cleaning up our code a little

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.099 
we'll be cleaning up our code a little
bit<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.400> made<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> little<00:00:05.879> bit<00:00:06.089> little<00:00:06.420> checklist

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
bit I made a little bit little checklist

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.290 
bit I made a little bit little checklist
to<00:00:07.950> just<00:00:08.730> change<00:00:09.030> things<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.719> found<00:00:10.080> were

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
to just change things that I found were

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.990 
to just change things that I found were
undesirable<00:00:12.559> so<00:00:13.559> one<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:14.880> things

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
undesirable so one of the first things

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420 
undesirable so one of the first things
you<00:00:15.330> should<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.660> we'll<00:00:16.139> try<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.100> start<00:00:17.340> from

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you should do we'll try to start from

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.890 
you should do we'll try to start from
the<00:00:17.520> top<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.760> work<00:00:17.940> our<00:00:18.119> way<00:00:18.180> down<00:00:18.270> is

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the top and work our way down is

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.150 
the top and work our way down is
externalized<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.430> java<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.890> we're

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
externalized this java here so we're

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.390 
externalized this java here so we're
going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> create<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> new<00:00:24.029> class<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:26.279> we're

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
going to create a new class and we're

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
going to create a new class and we're
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.550> call<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:26.760> class<00:00:27.150> validate<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
going to call that class validate and

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.290 
going to call that class validate and
this<00:00:28.560> class<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:28.980> have<00:00:29.010> any<00:00:29.310> function<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
this class will have any function that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.250 
this class will have any function that
validates<00:00:30.869> input<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.780> recall

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
validates input so as you as you recall

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.869 
validates input so as you as you recall
we<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:35.070> these<00:00:35.219> validations<00:00:36.350> LD<00:00:37.879> if

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
we have all these validations LD if

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
we have all these validations LD if
these<00:00:39.170> three<00:00:40.170> validate<00:00:40.559> functions<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.550> we're

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
these three validate functions and we're

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
these three validate functions and we're
going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> put<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.390> format<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.550> we

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
going to put them here format and we

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
going to put them here format and we
need<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.940> bring<00:00:45.300> along<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
need to bring along with that the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
need to bring along with that the
imports<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:48.960> lose<00:00:49.610> them<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.449> we

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
imports so that we don't lose them so we

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.910 
imports so that we don't lose them so we
need<00:00:51.780> Java<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:54.980> put<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:58.010> import

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
need Java you to put that in here import

warnings here come back here and we need

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.340 
warnings here come back here and we need
to<00:02:04.490> change<00:02:04.670> these<00:02:04.909> references<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.569> validate

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
to change these references to validate

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.089 
to change these references to validate
dot<00:02:08.890> copy<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.989> used<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.140> hear<00:02:12.530> paste<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.069> there

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
dot copy it used to hear paste it there

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.289 
dot copy it used to hear paste it there
he's<00:02:13.940> there<00:02:14.709> save<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.489> recognizes<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
he's there save it so it recognizes the

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.059 
he's there save it so it recognizes the
changes<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.260> actually<00:02:18.620> my<00:02:18.769> sequel<00:02:21.069> well

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
changes this is actually my sequel well

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.630 
changes this is actually my sequel well
Matt<00:02:22.510> see<00:02:24.220> okay<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:27.190> kind<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.250> lost<00:02:28.400> our

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
Matt see okay so we kind of lost our

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.050 
Matt see okay so we kind of lost our
JavaScript<00:02:29.299> format<00:02:29.750> here<00:02:30.140> again<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.910> let's

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
JavaScript format here again so let's

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.550 
JavaScript format here again so let's
fix<00:02:32.269> that<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.459> it's<00:02:35.150> all<00:02:35.299> fixed<00:02:35.810> so

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
fix that up see if it it's all fixed so

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.059 
fix that up see if it it's all fixed so
what<00:02:37.370> we're<00:02:37.519> going<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.849> do<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.329> also

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
what we're going to do is also

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.839 
what we're going to do is also
externalize<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:41.200> JavaScript<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:43.370> we're

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
externalize this JavaScript so we're

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.780 
externalize this JavaScript so we're
going<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.329> add<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.989> our<00:02:45.019> J's<00:02:45.380> folder<00:02:46.000> new<00:02:48.790> we'll

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
going to add to our J's folder new we'll

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.559 
going to add to our J's folder new we'll
just<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.090> file<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.750> will<00:02:51.680> call<00:02:51.889> validate<00:02:52.569> j/s

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
just a file and will call validate j/s

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.750 
just a file and will call validate j/s
and<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.049> will<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.470> our<00:02:54.760> validation

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
and this will have our validation

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.129 
and this will have our validation
functions<00:02:56.389> which<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.440> script<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:57.889> there

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
functions which on the script in there

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.650 
functions which on the script in there
so<00:03:00.139> we<00:03:01.010> need<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.579> regex<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.359> all

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
so we need to have the regex and all

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.590 
so we need to have the regex and all
this<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:05.060> case<00:03:05.239> we<00:03:05.420> need<00:03:05.569> to

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
this this is just a case we need to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.680 
this this is just a case we need to
validate<00:03:06.220> for<00:03:07.220> all<00:03:07.370> other<00:03:07.730> web<00:03:08.000> pages<00:03:08.030> which

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
validate for all other web pages which

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.690 
validate for all other web pages which
is<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.769> likely<00:03:10.160> since<00:03:10.340> we<00:03:10.489> need<00:03:10.609> to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
is going to be likely since we need to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.059 
is going to be likely since we need to
make<00:03:10.819> login<00:03:11.239> page<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.599> well<00:03:11.709> let's<00:03:12.709> try<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.920> get

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
make login page as well let's try to get

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.110 
make login page as well let's try to get
rid<00:03:13.190> of<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.400> white<00:03:13.730> space<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.870> seems<00:03:15.349> to<00:03:15.560> be

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
rid of this white space that seems to be

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.530 
rid of this white space that seems to be
useless<00:03:18.970> okay<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.690> we<00:03:20.840> come<00:03:20.989> back<00:03:21.109> here

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
useless okay so we come back here

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.160 
useless okay so we come back here
and<00:03:22.719> looking<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.739> little<00:03:23.860> bit<00:03:24.010> cleaner<00:03:25.170> little

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
and looking a little bit cleaner little

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.649 
and looking a little bit cleaner little
bit<00:03:26.290> smaller<00:03:27.599> which<00:03:28.599> is<00:03:28.719> the<00:03:28.870> goal<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:31.180> now

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
bit smaller which is the goal so now

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.399 
bit smaller which is the goal so now
that<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:31.959> got<00:03:32.909> rid<00:03:33.909> of<00:03:33.969> that<00:03:34.120> script<00:03:34.629> let's

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
that we got rid of that script let's

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.030 
that we got rid of that script let's
import<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.489> now<00:03:36.640> instead<00:03:38.430> j/s<00:03:39.430> /<00:03:39.849> validate<00:03:41.040> dot

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
import it now instead j/s / validate dot

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:51.210 
import it now instead j/s / validate dot
j<00:03:42.519> s<00:03:43.950> okay<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.420> externalise<00:03:47.109> that<00:03:49.139> okay<00:03:50.220> so

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
j s okay so we externalise that okay so

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.940 
j s okay so we externalise that okay so
when<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.239> was<00:03:52.359> looking<00:03:52.629> at<00:03:52.719> the<00:03:52.840> code<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.500> also

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
when I was looking at the code I also

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.449 
when I was looking at the code I also
noticed<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.519> I<00:03:54.909> never<00:03:55.389> change<00:03:55.689> this<00:03:55.959> back<00:03:56.459> we

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
noticed that I never change this back we

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.449 
noticed that I never change this back we
don't<00:03:57.549> want<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.819> throw<00:03:57.970> hours<00:03:59.099> usually<00:04:00.099> want

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
don't want to throw hours usually want

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.440 
don't want to throw hours usually want
to<00:04:00.549> handle<00:04:00.790> an<00:04:00.909> error<00:04:01.090> by<00:04:02.609> returning<00:04:03.609> a

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
to handle an error by returning a

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.599 
to handle an error by returning a
negative<00:04:05.319> one<00:04:05.500> or<00:04:05.530> an<00:04:05.889> error<00:04:06.069> screen<00:04:06.370> you

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
negative one or an error screen you

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:07.710 
negative one or an error screen you
don't<00:04:06.760> want<00:04:06.909> to<00:04:06.970> throw<00:04:07.120> an<00:04:07.269> exception<00:04:07.359> because

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
don't want to throw an exception because

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.250 
don't want to throw an exception because
then<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.889> whole<00:04:09.040> page<00:04:09.280> will<00:04:09.430> crash<00:04:09.669> and

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
then the whole page will crash and

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.640 
then the whole page will crash and
people<00:04:11.260> will<00:04:11.379> leave<00:04:11.500> your<00:04:11.620> website<00:04:12.299> okay

people will leave your website okay
another<00:04:14.650> thing<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.660> should<00:04:16.660> typically

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
another thing that you should typically

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.640 
another thing that you should typically
do<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.530> when<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.519> open<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> connection<00:04:19.650> which

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
do is when you open a connection which

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.850 
do is when you open a connection which
we<00:04:20.889> open<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.579> connection<00:04:21.729> right<00:04:22.690> here<00:04:23.169> should

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
we open a connection right here should

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.480 
we open a connection right here should
always<00:04:24.250> close<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.789> always<00:04:25.889> so<00:04:26.889> my<00:04:27.190> school

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
always close it always so my school

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.830 
always close it always so my school
clothes<00:04:27.909> see<00:04:28.710> I'll<00:04:29.710> close<00:04:29.979> our<00:04:30.159> connection

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
clothes see I'll close our connection

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.899 
clothes see I'll close our connection
and<00:04:32.610> another<00:04:33.610> thing<00:04:33.849> that<00:04:34.180> we<00:04:34.539> should<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:35.169> is

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
and another thing that we should do is

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:41.590 
and another thing that we should do is
add<00:04:36.909> CSS<00:04:37.409> to<00:04:38.409> our<00:04:39.360> for

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
add CSS to our for

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.760 
add CSS to our for
now<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:43.310> could<00:04:43.460> put<00:04:43.610> that<00:04:43.640> right<00:04:44.300> under<00:04:44.510> this

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
now you could put that right under this

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:53.340 
now you could put that right under this
link<00:04:46.240> style<00:04:47.860> type<00:04:48.860> equals<00:04:49.340> text<00:04:49.970> /<00:04:50.390> CSS<00:04:52.240> and

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
link style type equals text / CSS and

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.320 
link style type equals text / CSS and
we're<00:04:54.350> going<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:55.630> make<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.200> first<00:04:58.030> table<00:04:59.030> data

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
we're going to make the first table data

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.600 
we're going to make the first table data
so<00:04:59.810> table<00:05:00.740> data<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.310> are<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.520> first<00:05:03.610> child

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
so table data that are the first child

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.940 
so table data that are the first child
of<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.990> document<00:05:06.820> will<00:05:07.820> be<00:05:07.870> right<00:05:08.980> well<00:05:10.720> text

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
of this document will be right well text

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:19.810 
of this document will be right well text
line<00:05:12.950> is<00:05:13.570> right<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:18.340> table<00:05:19.340> data<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:19.790> are

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
line is right and table data that are

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.030 
line is right and table data that are
the<00:05:20.150> last<00:05:20.720> child<00:05:23.800> will<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:25.010> color<00:05:25.310> of<00:05:25.370> red

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
the last child will have a color of red

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.990 
the last child will have a color of red
now<00:05:28.040> there's<00:05:28.250> lots<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.490> ways<00:05:28.550> we<00:05:28.640> could<00:05:28.880> have

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
now there's lots of ways we could have

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.590 
now there's lots of ways we could have
selected<00:05:29.450> this<00:05:29.570> child<00:05:31.210> because<00:05:32.210> we<00:05:32.450> could

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
selected this child because we could

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.340 
selected this child because we could
have<00:05:32.720> selected<00:05:33.110> by<00:05:33.550> attribute<00:05:34.550> where<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.750> ID

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
have selected by attribute where the ID

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.010 
have selected by attribute where the ID
ends<00:05:36.920> with<00:05:37.040> underscore<00:05:37.520> error<00:05:37.730> so<00:05:38.540> that's

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
ends with underscore error so that's

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.200 
ends with underscore error so that's
going<00:05:39.200> to<00:05:39.260> end<00:05:39.380> up<00:05:39.800> appearing<00:05:40.370> with<00:05:40.700> Fred<00:05:40.910> Tex

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.480 
we have that now another thing is if we

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.100 
we have that now another thing is if we
