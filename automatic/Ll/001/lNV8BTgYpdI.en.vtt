and we didn't enable the fingerprinting

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.970

passcode enabled if you find that the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
fingerprints is not working it's grayed

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
fingerprints is not working it's grayed
out<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.840> can't<00:01:22.110> activate<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.890> probably

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
out you can't activate it it's probably

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
out you can't activate it it's probably
because<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.759> need<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> turn<00:01:24.090> your<00:01:24.270> passcode

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because you need to turn your passcode

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.810 
because you need to turn your passcode
on<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.830> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> funny<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.640> both

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
on it's kind of funny have to have both

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
on it's kind of funny have to have both
those<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> fail-safe<00:01:27.869> so

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
those on I think it's a fail-safe so

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.350 
those on I think it's a fail-safe so
there's<00:01:29.040> still<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.310> passcode<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.090> for

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
there's still a passcode in there for

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.350 
there's still a passcode in there for
some<00:01:30.509> reason<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:32.150> don't<00:01:33.150> their

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
some reason they I don't their

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.940 
some reason they I don't their

don't<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.820> guess<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
don't know if that's just my guess I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.030 
don't know if that's just my guess I
don't<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.229> necessarily

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
don't know if that's really necessarily

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
don't know if that's really necessarily
true<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.270> you'll<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.600> able<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> hit

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
true so then you'll be able to hit

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.539 
true so then you'll be able to hit
fingerprints<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> you'll<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.189> able<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.400> tell

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
fingerprints and you'll be able to tell

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.609 
fingerprints and you'll be able to tell
it<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> add<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.750> fingerprint<00:01:43.320> now

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
it you want to add a fingerprint now

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.870 
it you want to add a fingerprint now
this<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> first<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.250> I've<00:01:44.430> gone<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
this is the first time I've gone to this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.469 
this is the first time I've gone to this
process<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.640> fun<00:01:47.670> with

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
process so you're going to have fun with

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.260 
process so you're going to have fun with
me<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.040> together<00:01:50.340> scan<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
me going through it together scan the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.609 
me going through it together scan the
fingerprint<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> thumb<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.560> i'm

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
fingerprint or a thumb you know i'm

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
fingerprint or a thumb you know i'm
going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.520> home<00:01:53.759> button<00:01:53.790> now

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
going to use on the home button now

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.020 
going to use on the home button now
what's<00:01:54.960> curious<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.969> don't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
what's curious is about this is I don't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
what's curious is about this is I don't
really<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.710> my

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
really know if I really have to have my

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
really know if I really have to have my
thumb<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.520> position<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.119> usually<00:02:00.299> hit<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
thumb in that position I usually hit the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.679 
thumb in that position I usually hit the
thing<00:02:01.079> from<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:02.070> angle<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.450> see

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
thing from this angle as you can see

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.449 
thing from this angle as you can see
here<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.469> looks<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:06.590> doing<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:08.009> lift

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
here it looks like it's doing a lift

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
here it looks like it's doing a lift
your<00:02:08.670> finger<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.209> rest<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.810> finger<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
your finger and rest your finger on the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.630 
your finger and rest your finger on the
home<00:02:10.709> bud

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
home bud

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.540 
home bud
Lee<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:12.990> continuously<00:02:13.500> asking<00:02:14.100> me<00:02:14.310> to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
Lee so it's continuously asking me to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.780 
Lee so it's continuously asking me to
lift<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.180> place<00:02:16.310> lift<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.610> place<00:02:19.370> lift<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
lift and place lift and place lift and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.590 
lift and place lift and place lift and
place<00:02:23.720> your<00:02:24.720> finger<00:02:25.170> move<00:02:25.920> finger<00:02:26.459> move<00:02:27.420> your

place your finger move finger move your

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170 
place your finger move finger move your
finger<00:02:28.050> slightly<00:02:28.320> between<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.100> scans<00:02:29.610> okay

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
finger slightly between the scans okay

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.600 
finger slightly between the scans okay
that's<00:02:31.110> interesting<00:02:31.790> because<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.150> slowly

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that's interesting because it's slowly

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.860 
that's interesting because it's slowly
slowly<00:02:35.610> filling<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> picture<00:02:36.540> whatever

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
slowly filling in the picture whatever

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.250 
slowly filling in the picture whatever
that<00:02:37.050> means<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.180> weird<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:40.020> just

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that means it's kind of weird but just

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.060 
that means it's kind of weird but just
your<00:02:40.440> grip<00:02:40.709> wants<00:02:41.220> me<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.400> dress<00:02:41.550> my<00:02:41.730> crib<00:02:42.000> huh

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
your grip wants me to dress my crib huh

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.620 
your grip wants me to dress my crib huh
it's<00:02:44.070> kind<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.310> interesting<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> day

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
it's kind of interesting on the day

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.229 
it's kind of interesting on the day
that's<00:02:45.870> taken<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.850> doc<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.970> be<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> little

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
that's taken in here doc to be a little

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.300 
that's taken in here doc to be a little
bit<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.510> work<00:02:48.690> geez<00:02:49.260> all<00:02:49.739> right<00:02:49.860> success

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
bit of work geez all right success

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.729 
bit of work geez all right success
touches<00:02:50.790> ready<00:02:50.970> now<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.019> say<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.200> use<00:02:52.530> this

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
touches ready now like I say I use this

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.170 
touches ready now like I say I use this
angle<00:02:53.130> because<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.700> normally<00:02:54.030> how<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
angle because this is normally how I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.660 
angle because this is normally how I
open<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.600> iphone<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.950> interesting<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.550> see

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
open the iphone so be interesting to see

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.509 
open the iphone so be interesting to see
how<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.850> works<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.769> there<00:02:59.070> we<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.340> we

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
how this works so there we have it we

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.130 
how this works so there we have it we
have<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.730> fingerprint<00:03:00.209> secure<00:03:00.810> looks<00:03:01.019> like

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
have the fingerprint secure looks like

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.600 
have the fingerprint secure looks like
you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.440> multiple<00:03:01.680> fingerprints<00:03:02.519> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
you can have multiple fingerprints to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.250 
you can have multiple fingerprints to
this<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:02.940> i<00:03:03.000> guess<00:03:03.209> if<00:03:03.390> you're<00:03:03.540> sharing<00:03:04.110> this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
this so i guess if you're sharing this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.290 
this so i guess if you're sharing this
with<00:03:04.410> family<00:03:04.739> members<00:03:04.920> husband<00:03:05.850> white<00:03:06.000> kids

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
with family members husband white kids

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.240 
with family members husband white kids
things<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.870> nature<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:08.040> add

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
things that nature you can add

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.670 
things that nature you can add
additional<00:03:08.700> fingerprints<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.560> all

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
additional fingerprints to this to all

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.110 
additional fingerprints to this to all
just<00:03:10.860> stuff<00:03:11.010> looks<00:03:11.370> like<00:03:11.519> what's<00:03:11.700> also<00:03:11.850> need

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
just stuff looks like what's also need

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.810 
just stuff looks like what's also need
to<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.840> block<00:03:13.800> out<00:03:14.010> or<00:03:14.220> lock<00:03:14.430> out<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
to is you can block out or lock out the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.970 
to is you can block out or lock out the
app<00:03:15.060> store<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.110> choose<00:03:16.380> with<00:03:16.799> this

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
app store if you so choose with this

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.240 
app store if you so choose with this
information<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:18.140> you're<00:03:19.140> good<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.320> go<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
information and you're good to go so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.580 
information and you're good to go so
let's<00:03:20.820> go<00:03:20.970> ahead<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.390> check<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.049> out<00:03:22.110> my<00:03:22.380> guess

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
let's go ahead and check it out my guess

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.729 
let's go ahead and check it out my guess
and<00:03:22.860> see<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.430> works<00:03:23.670> we'll<00:03:24.269> go<00:03:24.420> ahead<00:03:24.570> and

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
and see if it works we'll go ahead and

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.940 
and see if it works we'll go ahead and
lock<00:03:25.739> here<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:27.470> i<00:03:28.470> don't<00:03:28.709> think<00:03:28.769> my

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
lock here and i don't think my

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.410 
lock here and i don't think my
fingerprint<00:03:29.430> will<00:03:29.519> turn<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.880> but<00:03:29.910> we'll<00:03:30.239> see

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
fingerprint will turn on but we'll see

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.390 
fingerprint will turn on but we'll see
like<00:03:31.200> i<00:03:31.230> said<00:03:31.410> trying<00:03:31.799> this<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> first

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
like i said trying this is the first

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.120 
like i said trying this is the first
time<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.620> looks<00:03:34.620> like<00:03:34.769> i<00:03:34.860> put<00:03:35.040> my

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
time with you and looks like i put my

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.890 
time with you and looks like i put my
fingerprint<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.540> didn't<00:03:36.840> do

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
fingerprint on it that didn't do

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.900 
fingerprint on it that didn't do
anything<00:03:37.110> see<00:03:37.650> it'll<00:03:37.829> slide<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.190> unlock<00:03:38.220> and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.330 

my<00:03:41.910> understanding<00:03:42.090> was<00:03:42.510> my<00:03:43.340> fingerprint

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
my understanding was my fingerprint

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.400 
my understanding was my fingerprint
should<00:03:44.459> work<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:45.209> guys<00:03:45.390> need<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.780> do<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.200> code

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
should work you guys need to do the code

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.170 
should work you guys need to do the code
first<00:03:46.739> right<00:03:47.190> maybe<00:03:47.910> no<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:49.560> doesn't<00:03:49.799> work

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
first right maybe no that doesn't work

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.539 
first right maybe no that doesn't work
well<00:03:51.180> okay<00:03:51.720> let's<00:03:51.930> see<00:03:52.110> what<00:03:52.230> we<00:03:52.290> did<00:03:52.440> wrong<00:03:52.549> go

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
well okay let's see what we did wrong go

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.050 
well okay let's see what we did wrong go
back<00:03:53.730> into<00:03:53.940> fingerprint<00:03:54.620> but<00:03:55.820> passcode<00:03:56.820> in

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
back into fingerprint but passcode in

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.870 
back into fingerprint but passcode in
their<00:03:58.190> fingerprints<00:04:00.680> passcode<00:04:01.680> unlock<00:04:01.880> apple

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
their fingerprints passcode unlock apple

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.280 
their fingerprints passcode unlock apple
on<00:04:02.970> print<00:04:03.269> store<00:04:04.310> fingerprints<00:04:05.360> hmm<00:04:06.360> not

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
on print store fingerprints hmm not

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.550 
on print store fingerprints hmm not
really<00:04:07.320> sure<00:04:07.680> what<00:04:07.950> we're<00:04:08.070> doing<00:04:08.280> wrong<00:04:08.459> here

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.520 

let's<00:04:13.560> try<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:14.040> oh<00:04:14.730> there<00:04:15.720> we<00:04:15.870> go<00:04:15.900> we<00:04:16.169> got<00:04:16.320> in

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
let's try that oh there we go we got in

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.930 
let's try that oh there we go we got in
how<00:04:16.739> about<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:17.160> with<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> fingerprint

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
how about that with the fingerprint

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.159 
how about that with the fingerprint
there<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:19.079> we<00:04:19.350> got<00:04:19.500> into<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.070> dealio<00:04:21.000> then<00:04:21.930> try

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
there so we got into the dealio then try

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.480 
there so we got into the dealio then try
it<00:04:22.229> again<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:23.130> lock<00:04:23.250> yourselves<00:04:23.640> out

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
it again don't lock yourselves out

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.909 
it again don't lock yourselves out
okay<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:24.669> we've<00:04:25.000> got<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> slide<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.169> a<00:04:26.199> law<00:04:26.470> see

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
okay so we've got the slide to a law see

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.320 
okay so we've got the slide to a law see
what<00:04:27.039> happens<00:04:27.310> okay<00:04:27.490> we'll<00:04:27.610> get<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.789> passcode

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
what happens okay we'll get the passcode

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.680 
what happens okay we'll get the passcode
now<00:04:28.599> I'm<00:04:28.750> far<00:04:28.930> put<00:04:29.080> my<00:04:29.169> finger<00:04:29.530> on<00:04:29.560> here<00:04:29.919> oh<00:04:30.690> wow

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
now I'm far put my finger on here oh wow

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.159 
now I'm far put my finger on here oh wow
there<00:04:32.139> you<00:04:32.289> go<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:33.210> just<00:04:34.210> for<00:04:34.389> fun<00:04:34.419> let's<00:04:34.660> try

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
there you go and just for fun let's try

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.990 
there you go and just for fun let's try
a<00:04:35.199> different<00:04:35.590> angle<00:04:35.979> I'm<00:04:36.460> actually<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.880> to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
a different angle I'm actually going to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.999 
a different angle I'm actually going to
what's<00:04:37.780> curveball<00:04:38.289> this<00:04:38.470> baby'll<00:04:38.830> it's

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
what's curveball this baby'll it's

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.210 
what's curveball this baby'll it's
trying<00:04:39.250> to<00:04:39.310> different<00:04:39.550> angle<00:04:39.849> this<00:04:40.000> way<00:04:41.220> OOP

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
trying to different angle this way OOP

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.700 
trying to different angle this way OOP
try<00:04:42.610> again<00:04:42.789> how<00:04:43.180> with<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.509> doesn't<00:04:44.410> get<00:04:44.560> it

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
try again how with that doesn't get it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.589 
try again how with that doesn't get it
oh<00:04:44.830> look<00:04:45.639> it<00:04:45.819> did<00:04:46.000> get<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.300> from<00:04:46.449> that<00:04:46.539> angle

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
oh look it did get it from that angle

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.439 
oh look it did get it from that angle
here<00:04:47.440> let's<00:04:47.620> really<00:04:47.830> really<00:04:48.639> see<00:04:49.210> if<00:04:49.270> we<00:04:49.330> can

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
here let's really really see if we can

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.029 
here let's really really see if we can
throw<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.720> curveball<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.380> turn<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.740> upside

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
throw a curveball and turn it upside

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.159 
throw a curveball and turn it upside
down<00:04:51.270> completely<00:04:52.270> opposite<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.930> way<00:04:53.050> my

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
down completely opposite the way my

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.559 
down completely opposite the way my
finger<00:04:53.470> did<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.770> oh<00:04:55.650> wow<00:04:56.650> okay<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.030> that<00:04:58.210> works

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
finger did it oh wow okay so that works

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.640 
finger did it oh wow okay so that works
very<00:04:59.409> very<00:04:59.710> interesting<00:05:00.699> and<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.599> guess<00:05:01.810> the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
very very interesting and I guess the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.140 
very very interesting and I guess the
failsafe<00:05:02.889> is<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.669> that<00:05:03.789> was<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.000> big

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
failsafe is and that was the big

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.749 
failsafe is and that was the big
question<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.630> had<00:05:04.870> was<00:05:05.139> what<00:05:05.919> if<00:05:06.069> you<00:05:06.460> know<00:05:06.580> it

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
question I had was what if you know it

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.640 
question I had was what if you know it
doesn't<00:05:06.909> take<00:05:07.060> your<00:05:07.270> fingerprint<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.530> I

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
doesn't take your fingerprint and I

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.830 
doesn't take your fingerprint and I
guess<00:05:08.830> looks<00:05:09.130> like<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.759> has<00:05:09.940> passcode<00:05:10.539> so

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
guess looks like it has passcode so

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.050 
guess looks like it has passcode so
that's<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.169> failsafe<00:05:11.409> so<00:05:12.280> if<00:05:12.400> you<00:05:12.490> can't<00:05:12.729> get

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
that's the failsafe so if you can't get

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.629 
that's the failsafe so if you can't get
in<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.840> can<00:05:13.990> do<00:05:14.110> your<00:05:14.199> passcode<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.949> away<00:05:15.610> you

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
in you can do your passcode and away you

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.360 
in you can do your passcode and away you
go<00:05:15.789> and<00:05:16.330> of<00:05:16.720> course<00:05:16.750> oh<00:05:17.110> wow<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:18.069> other<00:05:18.190> thing

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
go and of course oh wow the other thing

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.290 
go and of course oh wow the other thing
if<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.610> didn't<00:05:18.880> notice<00:05:19.030> there<00:05:19.690> is<00:05:20.080> a<00:05:21.300> program

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
if you didn't notice there is a program

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.379 
if you didn't notice there is a program
in<00:05:22.479> there<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:22.889> know<00:05:23.889> my<00:05:24.130> password<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.639> not<00:05:24.819> 0<00:05:25.090> 0

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
in there and know my password is not 0 0

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.939 
in there and know my password is not 0 0
0<00:05:26.220> there<00:05:27.220> is<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.430> thing<00:05:28.330> in<00:05:28.599> there<00:05:28.870> where<00:05:29.500> you

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
0 there is a thing in there where you

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.110 
0 there is a thing in there where you
can<00:05:29.979> program<00:05:30.580> it<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.979> can<00:05:33.130> program<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.550> to<00:05:33.699> say

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
can program it you can program it to say

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.159 
can program it you can program it to say
that<00:05:34.419> if<00:05:34.990> there's<00:05:35.199> 10<00:05:35.590> fails<00:05:36.840> erase<00:05:37.840> all<00:05:38.020> the
