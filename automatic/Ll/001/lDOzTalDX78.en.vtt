just to clarify so people understand how

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.440 
just to clarify so people understand how
this<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.559> I've<00:00:37.710> done<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.180> kill<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this was how I've done this if I kill a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.590 
this was how I've done this if I kill a
level<00:00:39.899> two<00:00:40.110> man<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.530> lumbridge<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:42.180> means<00:00:42.420> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
level two man in lumbridge that means I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.139 
level two man in lumbridge that means I
do<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.960> kill<00:00:43.290> another<00:00:43.710> man<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.399> invade<00:00:44.910> our

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.540 
do not kill another man in invade our
kin<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:46.020> falador<00:00:46.500> there<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.860> plenty<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.280> men

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
kin in falador there are plenty of men

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
kin in falador there are plenty of men
around<00:00:47.969> runescape<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.930> touch<00:00:49.170> them

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
around runescape I do not touch them

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
around runescape I do not touch them
because<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.280> already<00:00:50.460> killed<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.090> man<00:00:51.329> in

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
because I already killed a man in

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.500 
because I already killed a man in
lumbridge<00:00:52.079> unless<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.489> man<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> different

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
lumbridge unless that man is a different

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
lumbridge unless that man is a different
level<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.050> let's<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.190> kill<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.550> level<00:00:56.820> two

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
level so let's see if I kill a level two

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
level so let's see if I kill a level two
goblin<00:00:57.480> then<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.379> definitely<00:00:58.500> kill<00:00:59.160> a
