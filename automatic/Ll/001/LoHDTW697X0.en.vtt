00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.540
 hello to everyone then 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.880
 today in tips and tricks I 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.250
 you show how to change his 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.680
 spawn point with the software mc is 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.119
 says as you can see my point of 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.940
 spawn is where I am 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.440
 so once to see after creating 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 your party you leave your party 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.230
 you just have to launch the mc software 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.230
 is said 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 the spawn point takes a few months 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.719
 a minute to change it goes very fast 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.719
 and it's very convenient 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.590
 there as you can see my point 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.460
 of spawn and here I have just visited 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.700
 choose new place of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 preferably put your spawn point 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 near you 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.030
 to avoid getting lost so during 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 you click on move at spawn point 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.820
 you place it the place you want 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 and then you save your party 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.869
 / soul said to himself you just have to 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:42.720
 leave all closed you go back in 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:46.069
 minecraft in your party can you 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.069
 have changed your spawn point 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.060
 and as you can see my point 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.979
 of spawn has been changed it is no longer at 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.979
 the place where I am yes further 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.090
 this is a very simple manipulation to 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.310
 to be effective to be sure of never 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.480
 lose our house what happens 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.480
 a lot in minecraft 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.180

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.780
