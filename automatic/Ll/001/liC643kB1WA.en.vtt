larger<00:01:49.610> speaker<00:01:50.610> system<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:52.049> 9

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
larger speaker system but it is about 9

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
larger speaker system but it is about 9
inches<00:01:52.380> tall<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.100> it'll<00:01:53.310> fit<00:01:53.520> comfortably<00:01:54.000> on

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
inches tall and it'll fit comfortably on

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
inches tall and it'll fit comfortably on
say<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> desk<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.130> surrounded<00:01:56.399> by<00:01:56.579> this
