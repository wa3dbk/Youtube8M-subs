00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.899
 here are the fc eleven schiefgehen 750 as a board member at the dump 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.229
 I have her volume buttons 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.159
 no hit the nice slot for 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.499
 the percent rustic and the headphones 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.499
 Here I have a nasty hanging by the stylus 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.069
 Here I see the 5-megapixel camera with a game for self-portraits 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.920
 here on the one hand I have the chamber button here he cast a multitasking 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.650
 maybe you still test 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.580
 and here is room for knee reason is the cards 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.640
 the granny through the night and off switch 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 yes and the formula is in principle around 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.880
 these two boxes 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.410
 to accept modem per call 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 and punish on the left and zofft 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.660
 The silly very good over 20 would get them almost like mechanical ones 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.190
 grope 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.050
 In that case, I have a percentage here 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.230
 in the Rocky Trice go in principle like that 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.860
 Mini that is late 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.680
 That's a piece of paper to save 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 m sleep 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.750
 then look at the second display to be appropriate calls the 3-inch touchscreen of the lyre 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.700
 we are playing 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.820
 funded 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.690
 in strong sunlight can be difficult 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.270
 In order to really play here is again 240 pixels on and represents 65 thousand 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.320
 there 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.479
 if it's a this team, that's not a capacitive display 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.730
 Men otherwise knows 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.040
 This makes it a bit more mesh than single layer over perfection 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.540
 has foil over it 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 around and it does and the content of the mission behind it 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 little space so less Bryant than other phones 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.740
 that's not that annoying right now then i have 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.130
 get my starts here 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.850
 not more 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.549
 Here, for example, the pink can take the caller because the news emails 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.600
 and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.040
 the dates 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.749
 Pazzini Rome percent is one of those 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.999
 about that there is a total of 5 percent 5 skyrim script 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.989
 about the different contents distributed the round I still have 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.019
 his fast state bar 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.749
 where there are several functions 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.900
 Poets year behind tracks can call and we look at these only 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:31.339
 Vodafone Lawless is about painting exclusive brother of device 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.279
 I still have some options here 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.529
 and up here 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.539
 He knows you around 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.489
 that is behind the SKS surface - where possible for no dead 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.159
 water 6 points 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 if i care about it i have it here 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.119
 my states 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:54.639
 I'll go here now 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.269
 now we are on the 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.989
 secondly, there are criminals I have various widgets at your discretion 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 can arrange 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.520
 Now I'm annoying to the next Cinar 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.729
 more about my multimedia content 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.969
 So my music through here I like that 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.969
 by scrolling and also my pictures 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.789
 there you can see that nobody took it until 10 o'clock 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.189
 governs slower 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.529
 then I have my contacts here 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.529
 important too 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.869
 on time for the dmexco in Cologne 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.759
 Mr. Haasis is going home with some slowly 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.649
 and around here I have a few more village and specific 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 Minicom Claus it's the same ones here too company 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.999
 or ward off menu items 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.119
 zol then try out with a possible on the multitasking Kaster 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:04.289
 Here is more everything displayed what so much chalk to program is running 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.280
 You might want to check that out now and then because the sharks markets 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.989
 Programs are running the gate 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.989
 with the Samaritan finger tip, I can feed you 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.389
 break up 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.320
 or I can also fancy 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.320
 all finish 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.130
 yes and so I get a bit 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.469
 a brand new one 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.449
 overview what I also no 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.250
 which Hettich may be united 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.880
 I can also get thumbnails of the initial application 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880
 a show fight is nice animated 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.050
 I'm serious now 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.719
 Message minimized 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:45.220
 and neither a new one 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.220
 Take messages 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.790
 there is no longer deep QWERTZ keyboard faded in that Genn so the 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.380
 beautiful so small actually that the stage characters a condition 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.919
 I think so 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.219
 around or you take 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.270
 Stylist of the hand 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.270
 in turn, walking is actually very good 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:11.539
 that is not a problem but I can also get kids on it 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.569
 according to Malina Maier displayed in the keyboard 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.389
 if i cant enjoy that tilted to the side 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.680
 then I can get over too 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.950
 Yes, I change the cost extra backward 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.949
 displayed and with it 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.810
 it works with the kick then 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.830
 but rather you really have to be careful that you do not make a mistake 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.339
 so really big 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.339
 CD buttons me 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.509
 do not go for it 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.509
 not by a major fire 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.419
 and here 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.300
 I can also again between different input options 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.520
 choose 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.319
 Husbands also give percentages to pregnant children 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:07.470
 Connoisseurs so there are very different input options 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.619
 which has not shown yet 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:16.360
 is the main menu 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.949
 You already know that from the 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.889
 from Marina for example 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.889
 Fergie also the SKS surface as I am here 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.369
 king 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.469
 each to the side 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.000
 after continue by scrolling 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.520
 Ellen and he also has a survey 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.199
 about a mine 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.199
 all application areas ie communication multimedia 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.520
 Applications and settings 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.560
 So I wish that the phone reacts very sluggish and reacts 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.780
 Menu for me too 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.060
 sometimes a bit confusing because that's just percent 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.090
 not too many ways there is a single action Beijing can exist as there 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.400
 so many different ways 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.770
 Of course you can now also his can be the right one 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.360
 but choose 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.840
 He is said to be confused when taking Moras some 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.400
 Nevertheless, which now goes well and what perhaps the easiest method 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.689
 is 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.309
 at that time one otherwise for me but very good grown feedback and also the 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.230
 multitasking function around 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.280
 Of course very successful
