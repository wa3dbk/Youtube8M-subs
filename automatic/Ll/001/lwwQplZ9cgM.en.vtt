00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.900
 not crying nicely 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.900
 Strauss station 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 Germany that things bombard use to it 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.939
 why does not he do anything now 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.319
 I do not get it 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 he comes from the Stöckli 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.999
 but so far 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.290
 he does not do anything 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 I have already clarified 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 if that is now he suddenly 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.890
 may I choose it I would be pretty crazy 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 So a car seat on the product always includes surprise bags 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 not for that 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.650
 to agree on it 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.650
 "I do not necessarily have to be more expensive now 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.210
 Humor of the ski jump already dead 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.830
 US 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 the countdown 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 and dying would lose a rather chunky value 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 It looks like I'm here for purpose 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.860
 Prepared menu 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 not easy 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.490
 so i speak i was bad i have to say if its really too late 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 never 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 or comes an ally and sits down the 1 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.069
 No 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.229
 I can only do that 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 Vettel destroyed 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.079
 there is a lot of what you do 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.959
 not so good that is not all 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:56.919
 female 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.549
 feminine thing that becomes later on though it was easy 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.609
 So you still do not really think 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.999
 It takes a while until I can do it 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.999
 Almost a third does not believe only one person and can 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.860
 what the computational effort to then consult with a high waist 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.289
 but now should 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.289
 furthermore computer prohibition relatives in the building training 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.369
 could even be aggravated 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.709
 possibly can 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.709
 not accepted 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.849
 if they already managed 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:47.929
 I have nothing left 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.169
 meanwhile, inflation times of a minute are quite lost 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.689
 but we can the administrator diapers Guttenberg the grants yet 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:08.319
 so far as you can all buildings of the enemy's own brand Zinshäuser all 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.699
 Soldiers killed the plant one unit lost one 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.879
 he is already responsible in hindsight, even if one 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.579
 can not reduce any consequences and send the burning of hundreds of people 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.010
 someone can make his headquarters room for the bad Iceman now 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.639
 however, lets bring now 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.590
 Werner 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.310
 In the meantime, Ehrmann also describes and will do a lot in the meantime 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.759
 rather than others 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.309
 Kiel so percent 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:41.210
 that was also a question 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.689
 I do not know here 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:44.830
 Church Epe 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.830
 also very cool there are the two children here at the top 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.020
 but no one here 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.979
 I also had a laugh for Haye 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.979
 Price comparison on the Internet 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.460
 I'll wait too, it's not destroyed her was stabilized 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.460
 Zwick "Blood of the Nations" he quit job 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.839
 In any case, I hope now get an overview of what game I find 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.879
 Anyway, it's a good game 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.059
 Malsch Springer Play Computer is limited 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.789
 the transport associations for this market 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.789
 to fly 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
 I do not know how much it will cost 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.539
 Pattern of the mark 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.249
 if you do that 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:37.490
 Schedule 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.969
 aggravating branches and a 600 v I am Peter Scheuber 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.559
 we have to see if it can be retrofitted if there is something else 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.949
 I uploaded this video, the St had some comfort 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.129
 and now that the victims can not emphasize the relegation round Julia Spiegel rents 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.539
 do nothing anymore 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.360
 good advice at this point the now happening walls Crutchlow 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.370
 Give AXA 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.289
 Accelerate AXA 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:12.220
 I always think about giving up menu and then bounced and until 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.719
 next time
