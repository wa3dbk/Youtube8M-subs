00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.220 
just moving the ball right down and I
understand<00:02:09.550> playing<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:10.179> event<00:02:10.509> by<00:02:10.750> Oregon

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
understand playing for event by Oregon

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.350 
understand playing for event by Oregon
but<00:02:11.500> they<00:02:11.680> didn't<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.010> anything<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.760> hold<00:02:13.090> back

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
but they didn't do anything to hold back

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.540 
but they didn't do anything to hold back
to<00:02:13.600> Wisconsin<00:02:13.770> receivers<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:14.950> try<00:02:15.490> to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
to Wisconsin receivers and try to

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.430 
to Wisconsin receivers and try to
reroute<00:02:16.120> them<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.630> mean<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:16.990> just<00:02:17.170> walked

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
reroute them I mean they just walked

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.000 
reroute them I mean they just walked
down<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:18.280> with<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.640> clock<00:02:18.910> now<00:02:22.739> I'm<00:02:23.739> not

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
down just with the clock now I'm not

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.210 
down just with the clock now I'm not
sure<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.250> he<00:02:24.790> got<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.150> off<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
sure that he got it off I think it's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.340 
sure that he got it off I think it's
gonna<00:02:27.370> be<00:02:27.550> really<00:02:27.850> close<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.420> listen<00:02:29.200> two

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
gonna be really close I listen two

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.770 
gonna be really close I listen two
seconds<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> big<00:02:30.250> gamble<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> t-shirt<00:02:31.330> I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
seconds is a big gamble to a t-shirt I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.600 
seconds is a big gamble to a t-shirt I
just<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.319> assumed<00:02:32.620> he's<00:02:32.739> gonna<00:02:32.860> spike<00:02:33.430> it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
just I assumed he's gonna spike it

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.770 
just I assumed he's gonna spike it
because<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> alignment<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.660> wide

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
because of the alignment of the wide

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930 
because of the alignment of the wide
receivers<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> doesn't<00:02:36.489> look<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:36.760> an

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
receivers and that doesn't look like an

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.420 
receivers and that doesn't look like an
alignment<00:02:37.209> for<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.630> last<00:02:37.840> play<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:42.160> Ducks

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
alignment for a last play the Ducks

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.830 
alignment for a last play the Ducks
think<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.820> game<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.060> over

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
think the game is over

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.479 
think the game is over
they're<00:02:44.830> still<00:02:45.160> over<00:02:45.310> there<00:02:45.489> on<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> sideline

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
they're still over there on the sideline

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.699 
they're still over there on the sideline
