00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 hi all the third video from the series like me 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.670
 went to prepare now we 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.750
 let's go over the code stream 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 arrenov arena itself 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.469
 I will finally come out with a big 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.690
 square building so well here it is how 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.990
 before going out this is the stairs up there 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.779
 the hall which I have already shown like this 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.029
 ahead ahead of us waiting for the street here and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.320
 by the way there are very cool things there 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.780
 I have a lot of trailers think 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.980
 you know about places let's say places 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.010
 call meal yes no place to eat 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 everything is done here pretty 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.670
 Well I do not even know how to call it well to me 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 very all cool yes because there 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.940
 really long queues of trailers like 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.010
 would be a lot but if you look at 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.489
 the crowd whose time to see is even closer 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.949
 later back, I generally will not pass 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.480
 oh my god they are supposed to pass by me 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.329
 I just don't know what the hell are these people there 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.969
 cost nothing waiting but if i 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.070
 will have to stand there 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.190
 then it will be it will not be cool now and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.190
 I will ask 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:14.420
 strewn he was not coming so okay yet 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.450
 just ask a woman she looks more 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.159
 peacefully exclusive and even though she and 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:29.310
 foil he spodek arena 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.420
 come back to stop now this dance people 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420
 and stay 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:42.270
 ok ok thin match so kind of like 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.759
 sort of like i can come back this this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.349
 undoubtedly well well these people here they are 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.929
 just stand and understanding don't wait for them 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:52.109
 let go and 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.409
 easy mother and where did I go to the mountain 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.229
 not sharing here 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.259
 so right now I i figured i will figure out how me 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.179
 You can come back in theory, I just video 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.179
 just lost like that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:15.900
 this video is no longer possible 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:20.570
 because i'm all kinda like come out yes and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.570
 sort of like i don't have to stand u 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.080
 Despair Lich teapot oh well see 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.370
 start by the way with the weather no luck 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.100
 Already about her terrorist attack God forbid that no 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.270
 so here I am with the fact that the weather is very 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.190
 bad luck the third day is 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.830
 Come rain and that rain is normal 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.660
 fucking drizzle glasses which which 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.959
 driving even more rain than usual 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.110
 so dudes steelseries 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.360
 so trailers with food by the way there is a sin 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.610
 seductive always turn normal where 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.800
 queues never but kfc 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.580
 if here McDonalds I think in the chests 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.830
 it would be a bush everyone would stand in line for 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.840
 for food from mcdonalds sell here 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.330
 By the way, some kind of public 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.180
 frame 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.780
 so well, in the meantime, we go further 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.090
 see mostly of course these are people under 18 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.440
 years in general left audience 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.150
 eSports consists mainly 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.370
 people of such a plan by the way here let 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.760
 free what most interesting i don't know 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.340
 why 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.989
 it's good but admission is free like me 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.439
 spoke on the first video 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.180
 anyone can enter the column and 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.890
 look at lol because well gold 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.200
 really big yes no sense 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.760
 just sell here sell it 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.500
 tickets but also try to pick a panorama 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.269
 so you do not look at the ass dude 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.900
 that goes before me but yes here 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.010
 there are actually more people 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.010
 Logistics performed well but 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.430
 There is something to think about in general, like 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.430
 no one is perfect everywhere 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.750
 he 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.440
 lift up 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.440
 everyone saw 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:25.840
 that's how much I can judge the damn move 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:30.730
 yes it is a hell and the devil in the evaluation and 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:37.750
 here she is spodek arena ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:40.640
 because people are not going to all that 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.190
 the chairs were packed but i think that 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.860
 especially in the evening there will be no 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:51.020
 push over at least by 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.020
 At least I think so, because people yes but 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.190
 unfortunately unfortunately here 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.650
 held only lol 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.350
 here thread asana starks oh well there 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.170
 To hell with it 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.290
 there will be no grand final here 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:11.930
 only lol so we are not interested 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.490
 quite but something like that that's how it 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.420
 skoda itself and i don't really know me 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.520
 lingam too lazy to walk there 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.460
 anyway there is no interesting and hardly with 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.900
 I 'll go somewhere with my paper 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.020
 backstage I will be told dude what are you doing 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:32.020
 terrorist 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:34.720
 aaa no all m w accident so this 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.700
 companion and generally all something like this here 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.800
 here probably sit waiting commentators 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.280
 now and ask maybe i can you 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.680
 to show 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.350
 show this place maybe not but 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.310
 UAE 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:54.550
 ah kent who say no I can't 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.280
 Well, even with his curve piece of paper 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.000
 I can't go there crazy 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.380
 sad but i think it was a 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 that's there in general, then 2 commentator 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.410
 cutting I will increase it is not the most important thing 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.810
 in fact the most important thing for us is 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.990
 such from which is not here therefore we 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:17.710
 we go back I do not even know what 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.900
 record the fourth video garage here 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.910
 By the way, unused places 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.370
 there it is for sure you can all from somewhere 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.880
 somewhere backstage and don't fool yourself 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.790
 I thought it would be free 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.790
 for free , I will think about what to write 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.620
 fourth video and together with you we we 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.300
 walk somewhere else know maybe 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.640
 be by preparing yourself tight then 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.640
 thank you all bye thumbs up and good luck
