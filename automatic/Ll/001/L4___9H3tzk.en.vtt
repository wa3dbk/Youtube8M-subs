decks flowing about in big tournaments

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.550

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
for example the struggle comes when

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.880 
for example the struggle comes when
people<00:00:28.859> try<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> fit<00:00:29.550> 15<00:00:30.320> generic<00:00:31.320> cards<00:00:31.710> or

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.650 
people try to fit 15 generic cards or
maybe<00:00:32.070> slightly<00:00:32.520> not<00:00:32.790> generic<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.390> geared

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
maybe slightly not generic that geared

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.510 
maybe slightly not generic that geared
towards<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> top<00:00:34.380> matter<00:00:34.620> decks<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.190> comes

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
towards the top matter decks it comes

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
towards the top matter decks it comes
along<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> time<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.450> people<00:00:36.630> struggle

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
along a time when people struggle

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
along a time when people struggle
because<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.739> only<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.219> 15<00:00:38.670> cards<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.149> can

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
because they only have 15 cards they can

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
because they only have 15 cards they can
utilize<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> lot<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.410> people<00:00:40.559> say<00:00:40.920> that

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
utilize and a lot of people say that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.330 
utilize and a lot of people say that
it's<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.510> enough<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.350> utilize<00:00:43.800> against

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it's just not enough to utilize against

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.100 
it's just not enough to utilize against
all<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.760> different<00:00:45.120> decks<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.840> there

for my in my opinion the top three decks
that<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.500> format<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.309> stair

problem<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:57.690> are<00:04:57.720> having<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.350> feel<00:04:58.410> it

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
problem you are having I feel it

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.400 
problem you are having I feel it
shouldn't<00:04:59.160> be<00:04:59.250> raised<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.640> 20<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.270> think<00:05:00.690> 15<00:05:00.930> is

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
shouldn't be raised to 20 I think 15 is

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.770 
shouldn't be raised to 20 I think 15 is
a<00:05:01.470> fine<00:05:01.920> amount<00:05:02.250> 15<00:05:02.730> is<00:05:02.880> good<00:05:03.090> enough<00:05:03.330> because

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
a fine amount 15 is good enough because

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.900 
a fine amount 15 is good enough because
it<00:05:04.080> also<00:05:04.320> means<00:05:04.950> that<00:05:05.100> there<00:05:05.370> is<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.490> little<00:05:05.730> bit

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
it also means that there is a little bit

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.300 
it also means that there is a little bit
more<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.510> skill<00:05:06.900> element<00:05:07.410> it<00:05:07.530> means<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:08.010> if

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
more of a skill element it means that if

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.340 
more of a skill element it means that if
it's<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.640> 20<00:05:08.970> you<00:05:09.120> can<00:05:09.270> just<00:05:09.450> throw<00:05:09.630> in<00:05:09.900> every

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
it's a 20 you can just throw in every

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.930 
it's a 20 you can just throw in every
card<00:05:10.560> that<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.830> want<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.280> go<00:05:11.400> against<00:05:11.730> these

are just a part of the game and having

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.570 
are just a part of the game and having
15<00:05:36.660> cars<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.140> choose<00:05:37.320> from<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.800> still<00:05:37.980> a<00:05:38.130> really

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
15 cars to choose from is still a really

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.240 
15 cars to choose from is still a really
big<00:05:38.790> amount<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.240> my<00:05:39.390> opinion<00:05:39.690> yes<00:05:40.350> it<00:05:40.650> can<00:05:41.010> be<00:05:41.220> a

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
big amount in my opinion yes it can be a

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.760 
big amount in my opinion yes it can be a
bit<00:05:41.430> tight<00:05:41.700> at<00:05:41.910> times<00:05:42.180> but<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:42.990> is<00:05:43.380> just<00:05:43.410> you

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
bit tight at times but that is just you

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.340 
bit tight at times but that is just you
do<00:05:43.980> a<00:05:44.190> nice<00:05:44.460> just<00:05:44.790> how<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:44.970> game<00:05:45.240> is<00:05:45.480> I<00:05:45.720> feel

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
do a nice just how the game is I feel

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.320 
do a nice just how the game is I feel
increasing<00:05:46.920> it<00:05:47.040> to<00:05:47.190> 20<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.880> going<00:05:48.090> to<00:05:48.150> make<00:05:48.300> it

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
increasing it to 20 is going to make it

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.410 
increasing it to 20 is going to make it
a<00:05:48.510> bit<00:05:48.780> too<00:05:49.050> easy<00:05:49.590> it<00:05:50.010> kind<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:50.790> makes

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
a bit too easy it kind of just makes

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.810 
a bit too easy it kind of just makes
things<00:05:51.570> less<00:05:52.110> interesting<00:05:52.860> because<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.580> can

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
things less interesting because you can

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.670 
things less interesting because you can
just<00:05:54.000> throw<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.240> lot<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.750> side<00:05:54.990> deck<00:05:55.200> stuff<00:05:55.470> in

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
just throw a lot of side deck stuff in

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.280 
just throw a lot of side deck stuff in
and<00:05:55.890> for<00:05:56.370> example<00:05:56.880> if<00:05:57.090> we<00:05:57.540> have<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.750> teaser<00:05:58.230> or

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
and for example if we have a teaser or

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.350 
and for example if we have a teaser or
former<00:05:58.890> then<00:05:59.700> there<00:05:59.910> are<00:06:00.030> going<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.300> be

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
former then there are going to be

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.410 
former then there are going to be
probably<00:06:00.870> about<00:06:01.220> 15<00:06:02.220> cards<00:06:02.760> that<00:06:03.150> are<00:06:03.240> just

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
probably about 15 cards that are just

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.910 
probably about 15 cards that are just
going<00:06:03.540> to<00:06:03.570> be<00:06:03.690> sided<00:06:04.080> against<00:06:04.380> one<00:06:04.620> deck

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
going to be sided against one deck

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.240 
going to be sided against one deck
that's<00:06:05.490> crippling<00:06:05.910> and<00:06:06.450> while<00:06:06.780> yes<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.320> 20<00:06:07.920> deck

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
that's crippling and while yes a 20 deck

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.190 
that's crippling and while yes a 20 deck
is<00:06:08.460> supposed<00:06:08.850> to<00:06:09.030> stand<00:06:09.300> up<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:09.690> it's

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
is supposed to stand up to it it's

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.280 
is supposed to stand up to it it's
pretty<00:06:10.470> unfair<00:06:10.920> because<00:06:11.520> let's<00:06:12.510> face<00:06:12.630> it<00:06:13.050> it's

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
pretty unfair because let's face it it's

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.470 
pretty unfair because let's face it it's
not<00:06:13.500> that<00:06:13.560> great<00:06:14.190> when<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.730> have<00:06:14.880> about<00:06:15.180> five

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
not that great when you have about five

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.360 
not that great when you have about five
cards<00:06:15.960> on<00:06:16.140> your<00:06:16.200> opponent's<00:06:16.770> side<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:17.040> fields

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
cards on your opponent's side the fields

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.530 
cards on your opponent's side the fields
that<00:06:17.490> are<00:06:17.550> locking<00:06:17.910> you<00:06:18.000> down<00:06:18.030> completely

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
that are locking you down completely

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.620 
that are locking you down completely
because<00:06:19.350> it<00:06:19.470> just<00:06:19.620> it's<00:06:19.920> just<00:06:20.070> unfair<00:06:20.730> and<00:06:21.030> it

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
because it just it's just unfair and it

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.750 
because it just it's just unfair and it
isn't<00:06:22.020> clever<00:06:22.350> for<00:06:22.680> Konami<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:23.130> do<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.400> ebay

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
isn't clever for Konami to do it ebay

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.399 
isn't clever for Konami to do it ebay
isn't

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:24.409 
isn't

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.100 
isn't
good<00:06:24.529> business<00:06:25.039> sense<00:06:25.269> because<00:06:26.269> as<00:06:26.629> I<00:06:27.080> just

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
good business sense because as I just

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.290 
good business sense because as I just
said<00:06:27.559> that's<00:06:28.279> exactly<00:06:28.550> what's<00:06:29.059> going<00:06:29.209> to

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
said that's exactly what's going to

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.570 
said that's exactly what's going to
happen<00:06:29.629> if<00:06:29.839> it<00:06:30.139> is<00:06:30.289> a<00:06:30.319> teaser<00:06:30.649> or<00:06:30.830> format<00:06:31.369> then

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
happen if it is a teaser or format then

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.549 
happen if it is a teaser or format then
people<00:06:31.909> are<00:06:31.999> just<00:06:32.149> going<00:06:32.300> to<00:06:32.330> side<00:06:32.659> so

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:33.559 
people are just going to side so

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 
people even considered the possibility

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.959 
people even considered the possibility
that<00:06:51.349> would<00:06:51.589> go<00:06:51.709> up<00:06:51.800> against<00:06:52.219> that<00:06:52.369> yes
