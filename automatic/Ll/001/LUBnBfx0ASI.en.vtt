00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.660

 the description of the video for 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 download it you go to hotel and you look for the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.120
 game folder 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.370
 then models and open the gta 3 file 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.220
 then press the green arrow towards 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.200
 below you look for the mop folder and the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.060
 you open 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.189
 then models gta 3 point and mgm 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.829
 you select all the files and open 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.049
 to finish click on the diskette 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.479
 save or save and the mod is already 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.259
 installed but you still have to install the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.000
 memory fix maybe you're wondering 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.400
 but what it entails is the memory fix and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.430
 so they lose yes but the answer is 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.319
 very simple the memory fix is ​​a mode that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.530
 Help your game not to disappear 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.380
 the map streets or buildings basically 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.680
 this happens when you install mods whether they are 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.950
 weapons textures skins and cars hd al gta 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.840
 because the memory fix is the solution for 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 the work you must fix memory 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 install the real sky first since if 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.380
 you do not do it you will get an error 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.110
 try to open your game so keep 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.630
 my steps you extract the real sky and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.030
 you replace files just like you did 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.280
 with the mod transformers 4 the era of 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.560
 extinction the contents of the folder 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.920
 I think of the mod you move it to the creu 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920
 game 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.410
 the contents of the folder data from the mod 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.410
 you move it to the data of the game 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.220
 then the gta sa of the way you move it to the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.220
 root of the game 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.410
 now again we will need the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.740
 alzheimer to install what we need 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.400
 of the real sky or you open again the 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.590
 gta 3 file from your game folder 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.480
 then the green arrow down and 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.990
 you look for the real sky mod folder 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.210
 then models and then gta 3 point and mg 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.390
 you select the two files and open 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.240
 click on the save disk 6 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.170
 now you install the memory fix you move everything 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.300
 its content 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.090
 except the file read me to the folder 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.310
 gta root and ready you have installed 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.830
 the mode and the solution so that you do not get 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.630
 disappear the streets in case 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.330
