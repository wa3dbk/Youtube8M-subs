this<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:34.730> our<00:00:35.030> work<00:00:35.270> look<00:00:35.540> and<00:00:35.750> we<00:00:35.840> look<00:00:36.020> very

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
this is our work look and we look very

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.310 
this is our work look and we look very
work<00:00:36.620> appropriate<00:00:37.630> I'm<00:00:38.630> actually<00:00:38.870> wearing

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
work appropriate I'm actually wearing

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.549 
work appropriate I'm actually wearing
our<00:00:39.770> top<00:00:40.370> or<00:00:40.700> sheer<00:00:41.000> top<00:00:41.269> as<00:00:41.510> an<00:00:41.660> accent<00:00:42.230> for

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
our top or sheer top as an accent for

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.770 
our top or sheer top as an accent for
this<00:00:42.769> look<00:00:43.039> and<00:00:43.340> I<00:00:43.579> think<00:00:43.910> that's<00:00:44.300> why<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.510> chose

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
this look and I think that's why I chose

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.279 
this look and I think that's why I chose
this<00:00:44.840> color<00:00:45.230> because<00:00:46.239> you<00:00:47.239> know<00:00:47.359> items<00:00:47.989> with

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
this color because you know items with

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.700 
this color because you know items with
with<00:00:48.859> colors<00:00:49.370> can<00:00:49.910> act<00:00:50.210> in<00:00:50.929> a<00:00:51.199> different<00:00:51.559> way

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
with colors can act in a different way

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.950 
with colors can act in a different way
to<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:52.129> different<00:00:52.460> way<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.850> can<00:00:53.000> act<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.420> you

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
to a different way so you can act it you

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.200 
to a different way so you can act it you
can<00:00:54.109> make<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:54.379> as<00:00:54.469> an<00:00:54.620> accent<00:00:55.039> or<00:00:55.249> you<00:00:55.850> can<00:00:55.999> also

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
can make it as an accent or you can also

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.000

thoughts<00:02:08.539> it's<00:02:08.840> has<00:02:09.200> some<00:02:09.619> embellishments<00:02:10.399> in

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
thoughts it's has some embellishments in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.020 
thoughts it's has some embellishments in
it<00:02:10.640> that's<00:02:10.970> fine<00:02:11.410> but<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.980> wanted<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.520> look<00:02:13.760> at

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it that's fine but I wanted to look at

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.300 
it that's fine but I wanted to look at
more<00:02:14.750> professional<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.710> think<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.100> kind

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
more professional and I think this kind

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.490 
more professional and I think this kind
of<00:02:16.490> look<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:17.000> work<00:02:17.240> might<00:02:17.930> be<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> little<00:02:18.200> bit

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
of look for work might be a little bit

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.730 
of look for work might be a little bit
too<00:02:18.650> formal

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
too formal

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.330 
too formal
the<00:02:19.860> way<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.370> kind<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.390> died<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.260> formal<00:02:22.800> down

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the way I kind of died the formal down

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.210 
the way I kind of died the formal down
is<00:02:23.820> by<00:02:24.000> wearing<00:02:24.270> denim<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.560> also<00:02:25.830> decided

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
is by wearing denim but I also decided

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.480 
is by wearing denim but I also decided
to<00:02:26.520> wear<00:02:26.730> dark<00:02:27.660> denim<00:02:28.020> which<00:02:28.620> kind<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.010> mimics

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
to wear dark denim which kind of mimics

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.310 
to wear dark denim which kind of mimics
a<00:02:29.700> trouser<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:32.420> good<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.600> about<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:34.020> is

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
a trouser and good thing about that is

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.760 
a trouser and good thing about that is
like<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.570> light<00:02:36.930> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
like if you do a little light it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.250 
like if you do a little light it
wouldn't<00:02:38.130> mind<00:02:38.280> might<00:02:38.580> look<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:39.180> little<00:02:39.630> casual

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
wouldn't mind might look a little casual

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620 
wouldn't mind might look a little casual
and<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.620> really<00:02:41.010> wouldn't<00:02:41.340> go<00:02:41.520> well<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and it really wouldn't go well with the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.500 
and it really wouldn't go well with the
look<00:02:42.780> you're<00:02:42.960> going<00:02:43.140> for<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.270> an

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
look you're going for so I think an

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.880 
look you're going for so I think an
outfit<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.050> would<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:46.530> great<00:02:46.650> if

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
outfit like this would be great if

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.740 
outfit like this would be great if
you're<00:02:47.040> going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> maybe<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.790> conference<00:02:48.420> for

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
you're going to maybe a conference for

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.260 
you're going to maybe a conference for
work<00:02:48.930> or<00:02:49.320> maybe<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.830> meeting<00:02:51.890> with<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> client

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
work or maybe a meeting with a client

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.850 
work or maybe a meeting with a client
that's<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.450> good<00:02:55.020> way<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> look<00:02:55.620> very

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that's a very good way you look very

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.910 
that's a very good way you look very
professional<00:02:56.160> or<00:02:56.670> presentable<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.920> I'm
