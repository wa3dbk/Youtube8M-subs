00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.940
 no longer it has ended and it ends here 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.849
 in the draft you still are in 30 of 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.530
 January for if you want to do something 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.540
 but nothing else can be done with players 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.640
 Mexicans who have not played here in the 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.099
 last tournament with foreign players 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.960
 they already have the five places you had to 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.059
 make some change then I think that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.480
 we are satisfied with what is the 

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.420
 group 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.450
 in its qualities in the possibility of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.450
 the variants that can give us 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.129
 also throughout the matches 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.770
 and a lot in particular what has been the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.589
 work of values ​​in these almost two 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.440
 weeks that we have of the three of 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.059
 preparation of this tournament has been almost 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.290
 I would relive those of all the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.230
 situations we have opted more for everything to 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.960
 the time of adding each of the parties and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.550
 I think that has been very very favorable 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.550
 what is the understanding of what 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.440
 we want in the team some 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.509
 aspects that must be maintained and others 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.509
 that there is a need to improve 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.970
 reinforcement 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.000
 they are not the same are the players 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.190
 that you have registered in the league are the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.190
 same as you can count to release 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.350
 I do not know I do not have I do not have networks 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.630
 social a lot less I go by rumors of 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.780
 social networks I already told you that here 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 inside you work in a very 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.830
 clear very organized in terms of 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.680
 who makes the decisions how they are taken 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.630
 the decisions and not by situations 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.300
 of rumors but if there are many 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.210
 Sometimes you can talk to I do not know where 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.700
 where they will come but inside surely 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.819
 or to tell the truth is the first 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.500
 time I 'm listening to that name and in 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.500
 that also that position also 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.939
 That is the challenge that is 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.940
 we never worry about the subject of 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.960
 when we arrived here that template 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.850
 we have to evaluate it to walk what 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.940
 what is there and what is there that is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.700
 terrific we go to work in the second 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.670
 tournament also with some high and cows 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.250
 punctual 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.060
 we keep going ahead with this and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.430
 also with greater incidence in what 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.620
 what are the needs and the idea that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 we have football and they are already 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.140
 also in a timely manner and there 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.330
 we follow 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.330
 the challenge is always to try is the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.650
 better and surely than with all the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.650
 responsibility we are not going to assume 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.900
 this is the nose that is surely going to 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.450
 start the game tomorrow and as you know 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.770
 we are almost at least today 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.830
 today you are a week away from 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.010
 start the tournament then you have to 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.920
 give rhythm or revive the rhythm of 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 those who are maybe going to start the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.790
 party of the others that will be option 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.760
 then everyone will have time but 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.830
 surely some more than others that 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.950
 is the team that we in this 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.680
 moment will be better to start the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.680
 tomorrow's game to get all the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.950
 doubts we have for the date 1 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.350
 and I think we will go very well what 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.330
 we hope is that the team enters with a 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.030
 very clear identity be tomorrow not us 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.160
 worry as under artigues but yes 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.100
 how are we going to play we have not 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.990
 analyzed tigers you already know that 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.420
 way how good is this rival that 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.240
 is going to face how good you are going to play 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.510
 in the volcano and it's good that tomorrow 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.580
 everyone has that ambition and hunger 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.220
 and show that the team is there to 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.610
 fight for everything starting already from 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.610
 morning 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.380
 very well very well they have not liked 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.280
 a little 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.230
 Jonathan had been working 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.690
 alone preparing for what would be 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.420
 this is not preseason for this pre 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.670
 tournament this pre tournament phase has 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.670
 arrived well but it has cost him work 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.910
 and it has cost jobs because because it is 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.340
 the same imagine do not be that you 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.360
 you work on what is the individual 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.910
 too much in what is the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.610
 athletics then you are prepared to 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.770
 that you can overcome that burden of 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.150
 effort is worked in a way 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.100
 different as a physicist then comes the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.830
 soccer and you work it in a way 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.690
 complementary is to work as 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.000
 we work also costs you 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.569
 a lot of work and in that sense he has 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.179
 work side 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.699
 in particular he was going to go he liked the 

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:14.139
 work because he has been more time 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.159
 inactivity that deal with status 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.959
 regularizing all the procedures for 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.499
 be able to be with us and be an option 

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:24.950
 for date 11 be nothing else in the day 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:27.350
 12 we are waiting for the tms 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.150
 and they liked a lot of work you have to 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.550
 do a complementary work with the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.680
 individualized to put it more or less 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.900
 at the same level and the same goes for 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.360
 Carlos Darwin that nothing more than 26 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.350
 he returned in full with the team that is 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 a concern to leave those three 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.250
 players who have a little more than 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.250
 delay in its preparation at the same level 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.680
 ok good now 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.400
 welcome 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.400
 It is not
