00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.630
 to understand the word of God you have to read correctly 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.279
 this 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.279
 will make us discover how the book of the apocalypse 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 revelations should be studied according to their prophesied events and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.320
 revealed to the apostle John 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.290
 the revelations that he received are described in the key testicle the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.530
 first chapter to understand it write the things you've seen 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.360
 and those that are 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.070
 and those that have to be after this are three groups of events that we 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.769
 describe this verse 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.690
 and that will be the basis for growth 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.830
 of the book of the apocalypse by revelations 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.860
 the things you've seen 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.740
 bolatti writes play in chapter 1 does not reveal the testimony of the word of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.490
 god when he saw and were told these things that must 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.020
 happen soon 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.140
 these words translated from the Greek original would correctly express the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 things should not be soon white earth 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.410
 i those that are 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.990
 are included in chapters 2 and 3 are exhortations and calls from 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880
 Attention to the church of Christ to repent and walk according to the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.190
 God's will not to be discarded and our name has not been erased this 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.960
 The book of life are important chapters that the church should read and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 above all I would not go back to the farm 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.040
 and the ones that have to be after this one 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.990
 chapter 4 starts with these almost same words after this lives and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.969
 behold, a door opened in heaven as is the promise 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:16.799
 to the Philadelphia church I saw the trumpet and told me it happens here the 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.159
 rapture when justice the same words I have one of the things that 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.379
 they happen before the old turnaround 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.890
 from chapter 6 onwards he describes the series of judgments that come 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:37.040
 to the earth and its inhabitants everything that happens in week 70 concluding 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.040
 until the trial of the great white throne 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.189
 He also tells us about the izena weddings of the lamb and the eternal promises of 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.859
 those who are saved in Jesus Christ 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.199
 the spirit gives them a voice to diminish 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:56.190
 by design what its closure already in the air I have in brief amen 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 yes sir jesus
