00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
but you still cut out some of that wind

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.300 
but you still cut out some of that wind
cut<00:01:32.630> out<00:01:32.720> some<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.050> Sun<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:34.100> it's<00:01:34.220> not

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
cut out some of that Sun so it's not

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.830 
cut out some of that Sun so it's not
quite<00:01:34.490> beating<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.150> as<00:01:35.270> much<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.660> I<00:01:35.690> can

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
quite beating on you as much and I can

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.900 
quite beating on you as much and I can
tired<00:01:36.170> at<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.320> end<00:01:36.440> of<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.590> day<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:37.610> wanted<00:01:37.850> to

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
tired at the end of the day we wanted to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.890 
tired at the end of the day we wanted to
bring<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.060> up<00:01:38.180> here<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.479> actually<00:01:38.720> take<00:01:38.869> a

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
bring you up here and actually take a

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.030 
bring you up here and actually take a
look<00:01:39.050> at<00:01:39.200> some<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.650> features<00:01:39.830> and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
look at some of the features and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.060 
look at some of the features and
benefits<00:01:40.190> in<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:40.759> how<00:01:40.880> this<00:01:41.060> top<00:01:41.270> operates

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
benefits in just how this top operates

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.380 
benefits in just how this top operates
so<00:01:43.070> across<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.580> front<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.060> actually<00:01:44.330> a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
so across the front it's actually a

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.820 
so across the front it's actually a
header<00:01:44.540> list<00:01:44.780> design<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.530> don't<00:01:45.680> have<00:01:45.770> to

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
header list design so you don't have to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.440 
header list design so you don't have to
worry<00:01:45.979> about<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.369> use<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.210> existing

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
worry about that use the existing

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.270 
worry about that use the existing
footman<00:01:47.960> loop<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.320> center<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.740> you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
footman loop in the center and you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.249 
footman loop in the center and you
velcro<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:49.970> on<00:01:50.300> either<00:01:50.539> side<00:01:50.869> underneath

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
velcro to that on either side underneath

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.710 
velcro to that on either side underneath
these<00:01:51.440> footmen<00:01:51.890> these<00:01:52.160> footman<00:01:52.610> loops<00:01:52.820> you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
these footmen these footman loops you

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.300 
these footmen these footman loops you
have<00:01:53.929> a<00:01:53.960> snap<00:01:54.320> plate<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.800> install<00:01:55.160> on

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
have a snap plate that you install on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.279 
have a snap plate that you install on
either<00:01:55.429> side<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:55.940> this<00:01:56.300> comes<00:01:56.509> down<00:01:56.690> snaps<00:01:57.080> in

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
either side so this comes down snaps in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.109 
either side so this comes down snaps in
and<00:01:57.500> that's<00:01:57.710> what<00:01:57.890> keeps<00:01:58.280> tension<00:01:58.700> across<00:01:58.970> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
and that's what keeps tension across the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.790 
and that's what keeps tension across the
front<00:01:59.390> keeps<00:01:59.750> everything<00:01:59.990> nice<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.289> tight<00:02:00.590> as

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
front keeps everything nice and tight as

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.180 
front keeps everything nice and tight as
you<00:02:01.759> work<00:02:01.910> your<00:02:02.060> way<00:02:02.149> back<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.289> soft<00:02:03.710> top<00:02:03.920> you

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
you work your way back on a soft top you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.529 
you work your way back on a soft top you
have<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.399> mushroom<00:02:04.759> knobs<00:02:04.940> on<00:02:05.119> either<00:02:05.240> side

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
have the mushroom knobs on either side

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.240 
have the mushroom knobs on either side
you<00:02:06.050> go<00:02:06.110> ahead<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.380> pull<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:06.649> tight<00:02:06.860> push

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
you go ahead and pull that tight push

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.919 
you go ahead and pull that tight push
them<00:02:07.369> put<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.670> mushroom<00:02:07.970> knob<00:02:08.119> through<00:02:08.420> and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
them put the mushroom knob through and

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.480 
them put the mushroom knob through and
that<00:02:09.140> keeps<00:02:09.350> cross<00:02:09.590> tension<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.160> keeps

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
that keeps cross tension and keeps
