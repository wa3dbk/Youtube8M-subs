of my favorite old cabins and the reason
I<00:00:07.319> like<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.799> because<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.580> way<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.090> wood

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
I like it is because of the way the wood

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.230

window panes have got curvy wavy glass
in<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.139> which<00:00:16.289> make<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.830> cool

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
in them which make for really cool

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.179

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
reflections and what I'm going to do is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550 
reflections and what I'm going to do is

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
we're going to stop down to about f11 to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.060 
we're going to stop down to about f11 to
get<00:00:42.570> lots<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.989> depth<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.350> field<00:00:45.890> one<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
get lots of depth of field one of the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
get lots of depth of field one of the
really<00:00:47.309> important<00:00:47.969> things<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.780> shot

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
really important things about this shot

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.150 
really important things about this shot
is<00:00:50.000> being<00:00:51.000> sure<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> you're<00:00:52.160> absolutely

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
level and this is a vertical shot and on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
level and this is a vertical shot and on
this<00:00:57.059> camera<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.809> vertical<00:00:58.109> horizon

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this camera you have a vertical horizon

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
this camera you have a vertical horizon
which<00:00:59.100> tells<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.640> when<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> cameras<00:01:00.390> level

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
which tells you when the cameras level

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.020 
which tells you when the cameras level
it's<00:01:01.440> often<00:01:01.859> hard<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.489> you're<00:01:02.640> standing<00:01:02.820> on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it's often hard when you're standing on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
it's often hard when you're standing on
a<00:01:03.090> hillside<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.960> bent<00:01:04.530> over<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.700> lean

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
a hillside or bent over so if you lean

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
a hillside or bent over so if you lean
into<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> tripod<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.860> look<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
into a tripod like this to look in a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
into a tripod like this to look in a
camera<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> sudden<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.900> sense<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
camera all of a sudden your sense of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.039 
camera all of a sudden your sense of
level<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.070> off<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.060> having<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
level is off so having some kind of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.600 
level is off so having some kind of
device<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> camera<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.130> shows<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
device on the camera that shows you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.929 
device on the camera that shows you
level<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:16.020> helpful<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
level is really helpful this is one of

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.530 
level is really helpful this is one of
those<00:01:18.119> kind<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.450> shots<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.229> very<00:01:19.770> very

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
those kind of shots that is very very

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.480 
those kind of shots that is very very
dependent<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> lines<00:01:22.590> converging<00:01:23.400> in

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
dependent on all the lines converging in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
dependent on all the lines converging in
the<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.840> want<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.200> careful

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the right way so we want to be careful

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.190 
the right way so we want to be careful
about<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:26.390> want<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> emphasize<00:01:27.570> again

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
about that i want to emphasize again

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.410 
about that i want to emphasize again
that<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.250> making<00:01:29.670> landscape

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
that when you're making landscape

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.050 
that when you're making landscape
photographs<00:01:31.040> always<00:01:32.040> shoot<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.369> vertical<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
photographs always shoot a vertical and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
photographs always shoot a vertical and
a<00:01:33.150> horizontal<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.930> never<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
a horizontal you never know what the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
a horizontal you never know what the
editor<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.030> you're

i use on this tripod make it very easy

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.289 
i use on this tripod make it very easy
to<00:01:41.960> reposition<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.290> camera<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.030> can

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
to reposition the camera so that you can

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
to reposition the camera so that you can
make<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.049> vertical<00:01:47.040> shot<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
make your vertical shot and then you can

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
make your vertical shot and then you can
make<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> horizontal<00:01:48.570> shot<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> pop

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
make a horizontal shot I'm going to pop

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.609 
make a horizontal shot I'm going to pop
off<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> couple<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> polarizer

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
off a couple of these I have a polarizer

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.350 
off a couple of these I have a polarizer
on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> camera<00:01:56.430> here's<00:01:56.700> something<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
on the camera here's something that you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.469 
on the camera here's something that you
it's<00:01:57.479> very<00:01:57.780> easy<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.259> forget<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> do<00:01:59.340> once<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
it's very easy to forget to do once you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.190 
it's very easy to forget to do once you
reorient<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.649> camera<00:02:02.479> use<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.659> polarizer

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
reorient the camera use your polarizer

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
reorient the camera use your polarizer
again<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.219> get<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.909> polarization

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
again to get the kind of polarization

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
again to get the kind of polarization
that<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> want<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.799> remember<00:02:08.190> when<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
that you want because remember when it

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.979 
that you want because remember when it
was<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> vertical<00:02:09.239> position<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
was in the vertical position the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.839 
was in the vertical position the
polarizer<00:02:10.410> was<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> different<00:02:11.069> position<00:02:11.340> in

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
polarizer was in a different position in

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.730 
polarizer was in a different position in
terms<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.540> polarization

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
terms of polarization

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800 
terms of polarization
well<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> little<00:02:14.640> bit<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.030> break<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
well we got a little bit of a break the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.110 
well we got a little bit of a break the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.730 
at the gristmill visitor center area I
really<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.180> texture<00:02:33.600> once<00:02:34.140> again<00:02:34.320> of

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
really like the texture once again of

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.530 
really like the texture once again of
the<00:02:34.860> wood<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.640> love<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.000> windows<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the wood and I love the windows and

going<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.120> make<00:02:39.270> two<00:02:39.510> shots<00:02:39.810> one<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.620> kind<00:02:41.310> of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
going to make two shots one of kind of

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.090 
going to make two shots one of kind of
the<00:02:41.520> whole<00:02:41.760> side<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:43.290> end<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.010> the

here<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.260> focus<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.070> shoot<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.460> to

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
here and focus I'm going to shoot it to

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
here and focus I'm going to shoot it to
f8<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.480> hundredth<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.080> second<00:02:53.450> now<00:02:54.450> after

f8 at a hundredth of a second now after

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.960 
f8 at a hundredth of a second now after
I<00:02:54.900> shot<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.260> picture<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.100> really<00:02:56.550> love<00:02:56.820> the

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
I shot that picture I really love the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.060 
I shot that picture I really love the
window<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.540> left<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.200> i'm<00:02:58.830> going<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
window to the left and i'm going to

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.420 
window to the left and i'm going to
recompose<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:01.170> make<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> photograph<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.130> just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
recompose to make a photograph that just

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.480 
recompose to make a photograph that just
puts<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.970> window<00:03:03.480> move<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.860> hair<00:03:05.160> here

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
puts that window move just a hair here

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.600 
puts that window move just a hair here
in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:07.080> upper<00:03:07.440> left<00:03:07.680> hand<00:03:07.800> corner<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.370> this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
in the upper left hand corner of this

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.050 
in the upper left hand corner of this
frame<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:10.070> now<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.250> nothing<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
frame and now it's nothing but the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.030 
frame and now it's nothing but the

different<00:03:20.100> image<00:03:21.170> take<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> couple<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.650> those

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
different image take a couple of those

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.240 
different image take a couple of those
going<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.420> go<00:03:24.570> ahead<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.710> little<00:03:26.010> bit<00:03:26.220> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
going to go ahead and do a little bit of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.310 
going to go ahead and do a little bit of
exposure<00:03:26.670> compensation<00:03:27.030> about<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> minus

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
exposure compensation about a minus

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.950 
exposure compensation about a minus
third<00:03:28.590> stop<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.670> look<00:03:33.360> at<00:03:33.510> our<00:03:33.630> histogram

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
third stop and look at our histogram

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.740 
third stop and look at our histogram
real<00:03:34.440> quick<00:03:34.740> looks<00:03:35.220> good<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.880> think<00:03:36.630> we've

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
real quick looks good I think we've

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.940 
real quick looks good I think we've
really<00:03:36.930> got<00:03:37.140> something<00:03:37.320> we<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.740> work<00:03:37.770> with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
really got something we can work with

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.740 
really got something we can work with
there<00:03:38.370> as<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:39.030> can<00:03:39.150> see<00:03:40.760> there's<00:03:41.760> our<00:03:42.000> final

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
there as you can see there's our final

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.180 
there as you can see there's our final
shot<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.080> just<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.440> composition<00:03:47.070> we

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
shot and it's just a composition we

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.220 
shot and it's just a composition we
wanted<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.820> exposures<00:03:48.450> really<00:03:48.990> worked

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
wanted and exposures really worked

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.860 
wanted and exposures really worked
itself<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.800> nicely<00:03:50.360> can't<00:03:51.360> wait<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.570> get<00:03:51.810> this

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
itself in nicely can't wait to get this

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.900 
itself in nicely can't wait to get this
one<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.410> darkroom<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.980> give<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.370> shot

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
one in the darkroom and give it a shot

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.510 
one in the darkroom and give it a shot
see<00:03:54.690> what<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:54.960> can<00:03:55.110> do<00:03:55.230> with<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.530> well<00:03:56.310> we've

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
see what we can do with it well we've

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.420 
see what we can do with it well we've
come<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.180> full<00:03:57.660> circle<00:03:57.960> on<00:03:58.380> Cades<00:03:58.830> Cove<00:03:58.950> and

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
to the tree if you come a little further

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.330 
to the tree if you come a little further
down<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.209> road<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.690> can<00:04:12.840> actually<00:04:13.050> see<00:04:13.340> John

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
down the road you can actually see John

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.940 
down the road you can actually see John
Oliver's<00:04:14.880> cabin<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.870> John<00:04:16.290> Oliver's<00:04:16.709> cabin

is<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.220> long<00:04:17.520> way<00:04:17.790> from<00:04:17.850> where<00:04:18.299> I'm<00:04:18.420> standing

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
is a long way from where I'm standing

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.110 
is a long way from where I'm standing
and<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:19.650> might<00:04:19.830> think<00:04:19.859> well<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.910> know<00:04:20.970> you

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
and you might think well you know you

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.610 
and you might think well you know you
can't<00:04:21.480> really<00:04:21.690> get<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> good<00:04:22.109> shot<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.530> you

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
can't really get a good shot if you

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.070 
can't really get a good shot if you
don't<00:04:22.800> walk<00:04:23.010> up<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> cabin<00:04:23.700> but<00:04:24.510> that's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
don't walk up to the cabin but that's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.230 
don't walk up to the cabin but that's
what<00:04:25.290> they<00:04:25.410> made<00:04:25.590> telephoto<00:04:26.070> lenses<00:04:26.550> for

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
what they made telephoto lenses for

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.689 
what they made telephoto lenses for
actually<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:28.289> allows<00:04:28.710> me<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.220> stand<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.639> one

actually it allows me to stand in one

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.370

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
tree that we work the other day oh this

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.330 
tree that we work the other day oh this
is<00:05:48.630> going<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:48.870> be<00:05:48.930> a<00:05:48.960> nice<00:05:49.229> shot<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.830> love<00:05:50.159> this

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
is going to be a nice shot I love this

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.450 
is going to be a nice shot I love this
tree<00:05:51.380> there's<00:05:52.380> actually<00:05:52.710> somebody<00:05:52.949> walking

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
tree there's actually somebody walking

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.219 
tree there's actually somebody walking
under<00:05:53.909> it<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:54.630> we've<00:05:54.780> got<00:05:54.930> a<00:05:54.960> size

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
under it and so we've got a size

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:03.370 
under it and so we've got a size
perspective<00:05:56.009> on<00:05:56.159> it

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.680 

without<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:03.800> person<00:06:04.280> in<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.490> frame<00:06:04.790> you

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
without a person in the frame you

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.770 
without a person in the frame you
wouldn't<00:06:06.020> really<00:06:06.200> know<00:06:06.850> how<00:06:07.850> tall<00:06:08.240> that<00:06:08.270> tree

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
wouldn't really know how tall that tree

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.710 
wouldn't really know how tall that tree
is<00:06:08.960> or<00:06:09.140> how<00:06:09.230> big<00:06:09.470> it<00:06:09.620> is<00:06:10.120> so<00:06:11.120> I'll<00:06:11.180> keep<00:06:11.420> zooming

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
is or how big it is so I'll keep zooming

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.710 
is or how big it is so I'll keep zooming
back<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.350> forth<00:06:12.910> still<00:06:13.910> got<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.120> person<00:06:14.540> in<00:06:14.630> the

back and forth still got a person in the
bottom<00:06:15.020> of<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.170> frame<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:15.740> real<00:06:15.920> value<00:06:16.130> to

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
bottom of the frame the real value to

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.300 
bottom of the frame the real value to
zoom<00:06:16.730> lenses<00:06:17.210> is<00:06:17.420> that<00:06:18.350> it<00:06:18.530> can<00:06:18.680> allow<00:06:18.800> you<00:06:19.040> to

looking<00:06:29.810> at<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:30.080> subject<00:06:30.590> a<00:06:31.520> zoom<00:06:32.330> lens<00:06:32.360> can

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 
looking at the subject a zoom lens can

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.440 
looking at the subject a zoom lens can
allow<00:06:33.170> you<00:06:33.200> to<00:06:33.320> keep<00:06:33.590> that<00:06:33.830> same<00:06:34.070> perspective

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
allow you to keep that same perspective

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.900 
allow you to keep that same perspective
but<00:06:35.450> change<00:06:35.960> the<00:06:36.110> frames<00:06:36.620> and<00:06:37.010> get<00:06:37.670> different

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
but change the frames and get different

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.790 
but change the frames and get different
parts<00:06:38.330> of<00:06:38.420> the<00:06:38.570> of<00:06:38.840> the<00:06:38.990> photograph<00:06:39.470> in
