comes in two different forms a wet form
and<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.960> dry<00:01:46.229> form<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:47.189> wet<00:01:47.369> form<00:01:47.729> only

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and a dry form the wet form only

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.190 
and a dry form the wet form only
consists<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> about<00:01:49.110> 10%<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.780> cases<00:01:51.780> diagnosed

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
consists of about 10% of cases diagnosed

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.969 
consists of about 10% of cases diagnosed
annually<00:01:52.560> where<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> dry<00:01:53.460> form<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.180> 90%

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
annually where the dry form is about 90%

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.440 
annually where the dry form is about 90%
and<00:01:55.979> then<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> dry<00:01:56.670> form<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.119> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and then and the dry form is really the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.319 
and then and the dry form is really the
less<00:01:57.689> severe<00:01:58.079> form<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:59.250> wet<00:01:59.490> form<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.030> caused

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
less severe form the wet form is caused

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.170 
less severe form the wet form is caused
by<00:02:00.689> new<00:02:01.020> blood<00:02:01.469> vessels<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.159> actually<00:02:02.729> form

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
by new blood vessels that actually form

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.560 
by new blood vessels that actually form
in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> retina<00:02:04.369> thus<00:02:05.369> being<00:02:05.969> called<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> wet

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
in the retina thus being called the wet

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.139 
in the retina thus being called the wet
form<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.350> dry<00:02:07.619> form<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.340> caused<00:02:08.879> by<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
form the dry form is caused by the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.270 
form the dry form is caused by the
breakdown<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.840> light-sensitive<00:02:10.560> cells<00:02:11.009> in

the macula now the Mac you

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.130 
the macula now the Mac you

is a tiny little spot at the back of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.630 
is a tiny little spot at the back of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
your retina that is responsible for

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.060 
your retina that is responsible for
central<00:02:19.150> vision<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:20.080> when<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> macula<00:02:21.040> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
playing cards become more difficult

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.750

of their vision now the only way to
treat<00:02:51.820> macular<00:02:52.690> degeneration<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.620> if<00:02:54.280> you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
treat macular degeneration is if you

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.170 
treat macular degeneration is if you

have the wet form right now is to get

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.930 
have the wet form right now is to get
injections<00:02:58.840> into<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.380> eye<00:02:59.410> but<00:02:59.860> getting<00:03:00.610> a

shot right into the eye can actually

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.530 
shot right into the eye can actually
slow<00:03:03.370> down<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.700> formation<00:03:04.210> of<00:03:04.300> new<00:03:04.510> blood

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
slow down the formation of new blood

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.420 
slow down the formation of new blood
vessels<00:03:04.780> which<00:03:05.290> can<00:03:05.500> help<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.160> if<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.340> have
