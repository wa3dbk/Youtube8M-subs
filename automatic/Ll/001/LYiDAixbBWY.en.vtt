 Hello, perfect unlocked, peaceful. 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.609
 practically have no light at all between the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.430
 image of the device with the TV image 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:53.230
 for us to play here a 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:55.540
 little worse tastes servers I do not 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.200
 I know if the sound will come out on TV yet 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.200
 I did this test 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:14.760
 back on TV but you control the 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.370
 sound here by phone from the O grandmother person 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.710
 Sound is from the cell phone going to TV. 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.450
 so come on and let's give a 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.450
 demonstration of the game 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.080
 worse than you can not give the player 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.260
 looking to see you're personal side to tv 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.660
 In this case, it would be just to make a 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.710
 demonstration and because it has a 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.710
 tiny 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.380
 the staff here of the game 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.050
 I installed the egg in class a tea, that's why 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.630
 he asked what he did here 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.420
 I should have put it on forever but it's 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.420
 this very very quiet staff who 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.570
 Let's put a calendar here. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.480
 he picks it up so there he picks up the screen 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.710
 whole now so he just as a 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.500
 bit on top even and sides you 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.990
 You can see here you can see he has 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.570
 so the 3-5 very large 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.440
 O here he also small cornrows to 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.660
 so he eats a little but the flight 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:40.770
 the screen update is fast right 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.550
 This is very simple and practical. 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:48.510
 fast you connect the sky s5 a tv with 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.090
 this ac adapter is the mhl adapter 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.180
 in case I bought the mma is from samsung 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.750
 even okay but could be any 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.660
 nhl adapter connected to a 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.180
 also the device if it has usb with 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.070
 ml it can also be connected in this 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.800
 samsung device is also 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.140
 Other than that, that's ok, then. 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.720
