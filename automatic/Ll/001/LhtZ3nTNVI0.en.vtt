they're all seeming pretty balanced
which<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.810> quite<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.500> apply<00:00:25.740> when<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
which I quite like about apply when I

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.040

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
77 passing I believe it says can't see

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
77 passing I believe it says can't see
it<00:00:33.989> exactly<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.980> fully

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
it exactly because it's not fully

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.319 
still a reasonable price for him some
people<00:01:37.110> comparing<00:01:37.590> him<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.829> El<00:01:38.040> Shaarawy<00:01:38.340> now

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
people comparing him to El Shaarawy now

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.380 
people comparing him to El Shaarawy now
he's<00:01:39.750> left<00:01:39.960> forward<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.460> he

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
he's left forward and I don't think he

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.600 
he's left forward and I don't think he
is<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.689> good<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.259> some<00:01:43.560> people<00:01:44.009> who<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.460> use

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
is as good but some people who don't use

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
is as good but some people who don't use
skills<00:01:44.970> much<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.570> say<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.110> build<00:01:46.380> because

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
obviously if they do get El Shaarawy

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.880 
obviously if they do get El Shaarawy
they're<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.930> gonna<00:01:49.049> use<00:01:49.259> him<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.680> for
