put in like a few curls where I knew

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.270 
put in like a few curls where I knew
like<00:04:50.289> it<00:04:50.530> was<00:04:50.680> gonna<00:04:50.860> fall<00:04:51.160> straight<00:04:52.860> think<00:04:54.750> I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
like it was gonna fall straight think I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.460 
like it was gonna fall straight think I
care<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.360> just<00:05:01.419> wrap<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.840> around<00:05:02.259> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
care so you just wrap it around the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.140 
care so you just wrap it around the
barrel<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.099> want<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.490> needle<00:05:03.789> straight

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
end close it makes it look less natural

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.650 
end close it makes it look less natural
I<00:05:07.419> guess<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:10.150> fact<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.419> you<00:05:10.539> already

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660
