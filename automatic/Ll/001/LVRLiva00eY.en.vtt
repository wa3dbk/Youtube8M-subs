00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.980
 hi how is this my first video 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.750
 talking about some product and I did not know 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.670
 very well the truth be started by a 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.000
 product that has gone wrong or so 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.039
 agreed well then to start with 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.510
 good foot I'll be with one who has 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.690
 gone pretty well 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.900
 the serum to aim dry of avon the 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.590
 from the green cap 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.230
 i 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.400
 good 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.110
 it's for a dry tips but me and so 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.180
 everyone that I know who use it 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.750
 he throws it all the way down the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.680
 root is supposed to get you to the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.580
 good tip well I feel much better 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.440
 since he says that I'm using it already 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.540
 he had spent a boat and this goes by the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.540
 half over here 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.380
 then but I'm super happy with 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380
 the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.000
 it does not open to me as much as it used to 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 part that I used to do like this and I had left 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.540
 with a piece of hair in his hand and nothing 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.080
 that's what happens to me , that is, what's good 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.450
 This is the ultimate product because the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.990
 I really do not play it with others 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.080
 because good if with one of them the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 valencia that was also green that not 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 I have a term there but this one has 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.900
 liked more because imagine dry that what 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.030
 used when I remembered and this is a 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.330
 fixed thing that it seems that if I have not 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770
 done as I'm missing something in my hair 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.670
 love that serum so this one 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.980
 I recommend 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.270
 OK 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.050
 It's worth 5 euros normally it's very rare that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 valga 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.480
 that cost more than 5 but what can 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 to be is that gap in some of the 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.600
 catalogs it seems to me that if 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.700
 they buy one you get 5 with something and if 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.990
 purchases 3 you get less than 3 so you 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.280
 for people who use it a lot like me 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.310
 because I have very long hair look 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.730
 Well, it's good to have quantity 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.380
 because it is spent very quickly is spent 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.000
 right now because I use it a lot 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.990
 I when I shower, I use it when 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.400
 I know when I get up on the 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.620
 love morning I have my hair a little 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.870
 dry like that even though I 'm not going to wash it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.650
 I've done a little more and I 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.360
 I hit the tip 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.400
 super well nothing good in 30 milliliters 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.030
 sorry I forgot to say it 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.340
 and nothing that I recommend 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 without some conversions for the next 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.060
 bye
