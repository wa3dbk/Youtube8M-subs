00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
five minutes of running how far would
you<00:01:46.800> prefer<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.400> once<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> progress<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.240> five

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you prefer it once you progress to five

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
you prefer it once you progress to five
minutes<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> running<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:50.010> can<00:01:50.190> run<00:01:50.400> for

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
minutes of running then you can run for

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
minutes of running then you can run for
15<00:01:50.850> minutes<00:01:51.180> straight<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.260> what<00:01:52.409> I'm

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
15 minutes straight so what I'm

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.070 
15 minutes straight so what I'm
suggesting<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:54.210> total<00:01:54.479> run<00:01:54.810> is

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
suggesting here is your total run is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.080 
suggesting here is your total run is
only<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.620> be<00:01:55.740> 15<00:01:56.130> minutes<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
only going to be 15 minutes of the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.820 
only going to be 15 minutes of the
walking<00:01:57.330> or<00:01:57.540> running<00:01:57.659> once<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.440> get<00:01:58.620> up<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
walking or running once you get up to

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.020 
walking or running once you get up to
the<00:01:58.920> point<00:01:59.159> where<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.640> run

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the point where you can just run

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.450 
the point where you can just run
straight<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.659> 15<00:02:01.229> minutes<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
straight for 15 minutes then what I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.219 
straight for 15 minutes then what I
would<00:02:02.549> recommend<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:03.330> you<00:02:03.420> progress<00:02:03.720> yourself

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
would recommend is you progress yourself

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.700 
would recommend is you progress yourself
like<00:02:04.560> 10<00:02:04.860> minutes<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.030> approximately

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
like 10 minutes which is approximately

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.430 
like 10 minutes which is approximately
two<00:02:07.710> kilometers<00:02:07.740> each<00:02:08.610> week<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.780> each<00:02:10.110> week

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
two kilometers each week so each week

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.899 
two kilometers each week so each week
you're<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.280> yourself<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.790> run

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
you're just going to get yourself to run

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.430 
you're just going to get yourself to run
five<00:02:12.269> minutes<00:02:12.629> longer<00:02:12.870> than<00:02:13.019> you<00:02:13.200> did<00:02:13.349> before

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
five minutes longer than you did before

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.190 
five minutes longer than you did before
you<00:02:13.709> don't<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.580> go<00:02:14.730> from<00:02:15.150> 0<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.720> 30

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
you don't want to go from 0 to 30

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.229 
you don't want to go from 0 to 30
minutes<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.280> once<00:02:17.310> it's<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.940> too<00:02:18.090> much

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
minutes all at once it's just too much

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.170 
minutes all at once it's just too much
for<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> body

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
for the body

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.750 
for the body
okay<00:02:19.930> honey<00:02:20.379> don't<00:02:20.650> focus<00:02:20.829> so<00:02:21.129> much<00:02:21.189> about<00:02:21.549> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
okay honey don't focus so much about the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.849 
okay honey don't focus so much about the
kilometer<00:02:22.209> distance<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:23.049> do<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.530> once

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
kilometer distance you can do that once

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.770 
kilometer distance you can do that once
you've<00:02:24.129> started<00:02:24.340> running<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.879> lot<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.150> 5<00:02:25.329> k's<00:02:25.599> or

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
you've started running a lot of 5 k's or

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.899 
you've started running a lot of 5 k's or
10<00:02:25.930> k's<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:26.829> for<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:27.129> just<00:02:27.340> focus<00:02:27.519> on<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
10 k's but for now just focus on the

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.880 
10 k's but for now just focus on the
length<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.180> time<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.629> sent<00:02:28.900> running<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.709> as<00:02:29.799> i

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
length of time you sent running so as i

mentioned earlier first start with the
15<00:02:31.599> minutes<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.109> then<00:02:32.170> once<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.890> get<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.099> 15

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
15 minutes and then once you get to 15

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.009 
15 minutes and then once you get to 15
minutes<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.879> straight<00:02:34.120> running<00:02:34.359> then

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
minutes of straight running then

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.289
