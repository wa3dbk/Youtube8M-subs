00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.640
 freshwater waves in the heart of 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.740
 mountains of the basque country in spain 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.410
 scenario was unknown to nick van 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.960
 dick surfer since 4 years old and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 world champion in the junior category 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.470
 the emotion is very similar to hundreds of 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.470
 kilometers from the ocean 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.789
 I find it very difficult to recreate a wave 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.710
 identified sea ​​but from here they seem very 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.000
 it's a lot of fun for surfers 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.680
 any technical level and publicize the store 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.179
 they are really very good 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 It's very funny and especially for 

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.300
 us professionals is an option in the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.010
 training place 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.940
 an option for us to work our 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.949
 skills in the south to queue 15 years ago 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.659
 José Manuel Rodrigues only started to 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.609
 develop artificial waves that 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.389
 respond to the needs of the 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:56.339
 surfers in 2012 him to his team 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:58.559
 built this prototype gear 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.780
 has a blade on a rail and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.119
 moves to the bottom of the water to create the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.920
 wave dragged fine is needed 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.870
 find a balance between all 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 factors that affect the simulation of 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.320
 phenomenon , the speed and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.120
 depth to the way of pushing 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 to maintain low water consumption. 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.300
 only I who spoke before 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.910
 consume this year 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.860
 a simple idea but that cost years of 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.560
 work in contrast to other systems 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.930
 in workshops the process created in the wave 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.540
 garden requires little electricity in one 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.860
 total cost of 22 cents per 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.480
 samsung motors wave 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.670
 sometimes we go in places that are 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.700
 so many surfers that it takes two hours 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.050
 by two fast waves to catch 21 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.050
 waves in an hour is too much 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.630
 this way surfing can turn into 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.950
 a more accessible and practiced sport 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.620
 even far from the sea 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.100
 who would say uhf of mountains is a 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.100
 reality
