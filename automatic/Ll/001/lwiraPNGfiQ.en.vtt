00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.729
 pay attention because a big one is everywhere that 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.530
 can go chronically and then I go 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.210
 So simply join it but I'll 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.950

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.200
 tree oil soil is so fucking 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.219
 Overpowed in this game I just had one 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.719
 one throws to get there 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:11.829
 maybe also throw once 

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.079
 watch one more time 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.340
 boom to those who do n't miss unfortunately 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.020
 it's a pity 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.119
 sometimes they go sometimes they go day by day 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.740
 their odds being four like a game 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.869
 but I will have a very last time 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.340
 explain how the hell you are again 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.469
 grenade how you well I everything you that four 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.000
 has to start up ok very easy on the 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.189
 playstation 3 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.990
 you start your call of duty 4 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.329
 So you do the CD rd in when they 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.159
 he is going to start it up 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.499
 the moment that call of duty fiat 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.460
 startup is you pull your internet camped 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.079
 Goddamnit 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.759
 no kidding pull your bets on 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.109
 back like your internet come out 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.429
 separate them out and multiplayer and 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.869
 if you sit at the multiplayer you do 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.749
 your internet bald again and then 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.890
 you go on to a game you a stupid 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.479
 girl you turn 10 and then you know sports 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.679
 I much what you want players 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.939
 you just have to use your internet 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.590
 pull out the game can still be 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.390
 play a little bullshit all but 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.890
 this game that is that has been hacked and is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.210
 completely broken 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.740
 therefore it must be in a difficult way 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.280
 but it is still like a game 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.990
 to play 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.509
 that is why it is for a while 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.979
 worth it and how can I continue 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.990
 casting touch that I also see own 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.780
 screen and the enemies can still be used 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.060
 chilling i am i look then 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.470
 I also feel that fat is the host of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.420
 that guy is the host where this game 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.830
 everyone seemed to lay a whole plate later 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.270
 except he sugar everyone and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.070
 we can't do that at all 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.280
 do when we meet him is like one 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.960
 little nonsense of course is the game because 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.250

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.720
 and first game because that purchased show 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.190
 many players of course tibet my taste 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.570
 he finds Messi with so much work so 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.430
 pastor starts but the only thing I do 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.750
 can find pastors and led commercials or 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.250
 no signs at all so it is one 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.780
 bit it is a bit to the honor that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.250
 tame still is a fun game too 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.900
