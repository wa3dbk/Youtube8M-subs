where I I knew he'd sort of stay up

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
where I I knew he'd sort of stay up
front<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.199> obviously<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
front because obviously if you know it's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
front because obviously if you know it's
his<00:01:02.670> passing<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.750> great<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.320> definitely

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
his passing is not great it's definitely

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649

one<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> his<00:01:05.070> negative<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.909> figured<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
one of his negative so I figured what I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.030 
one of his negative so I figured what I
want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.590> get<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> load<00:01:08.010> of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.060 
dreadful I don't think I've seen a a
lower<00:01:33.030> free<00:01:33.420> kick<00:01:33.630> accuracy<00:01:33.990> stat<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> think

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
lower free kick accuracy stat I I think

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.770 
lower free kick accuracy stat I I think

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I said this on a proton a player of you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.920 
I said this on a proton a player of you
before<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.320> inform<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.720> wrong

before then inform but I was wrong

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.310 
before then inform but I was wrong

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
clearly he has got an even lower free

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.499 
clearly he has got an even lower free
kick<00:01:43.470> accuracy<00:01:44.220> stat<00:01:44.579> than<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.909> fought<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060 
kick accuracy stat than I fought it
could<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.110> possible<00:01:46.229> especially<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
could be possible especially for a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.440 
could be possible especially for a
legend<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> striker<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.329> was

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
legend and a striker so that was

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480

strength<00:02:41.330> as<00:02:41.510> well<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.840> found<00:02:42.110> him<00:02:42.290> constantly

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
strength as well I found him constantly

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.740 
strength as well I found him constantly
and<00:02:42.890> battered<00:02:43.220> down<00:02:43.400> which<00:02:43.670> was<00:02:43.820> off<00:02:43.970> one<00:02:44.210> you

think<00:02:44.960> that'd<00:02:45.110> be<00:02:45.230> good<00:02:45.410> because<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:46.550> know

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
think that'd be good because I you know

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.890 
think that'd be good because I you know
I<00:02:46.670> got<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> lot<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> free<00:02:47.270> kicks<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:47.750> he

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
I got a lot of free kicks but he

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.030 
I got a lot of free kicks but he
couldn't<00:02:48.200> take<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:48.710> that<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:48.890> an<00:02:48.950> issue

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
couldn't take that so that was an issue

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.340 
couldn't take that so that was an issue
however<00:02:49.730> pace<00:02:50.150> was<00:02:50.480> pretty<00:02:50.840> good<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.140> actually

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
however pace was pretty good I actually

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.200 
however pace was pretty good I actually
noticed<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.800> lot<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.190> time<00:02:52.400> he<00:02:53.060> would

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
noticed a lot of the time he would

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.520 
noticed a lot of the time he would
dribble<00:02:53.420> past<00:02:53.720> defenders<00:02:54.020> and<00:02:54.290> he<00:02:54.410> would

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
dribble past defenders and he would

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.020 
dribble past defenders and he would
literally<00:02:54.860> leave<00:02:55.190> them<00:02:55.400> behind<00:02:55.520> they<00:02:55.760> tried

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
literally leave them behind they tried

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.990 
literally leave them behind they tried
tucking<00:02:56.390> him<00:02:56.510> back<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:56.870> he's<00:02:57.080> still<00:02:57.410> going<00:02:57.680> uh

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
tucking him back but he's still going uh

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.430

wouldn't see legends they think there

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.900 
wouldn't see legends they think there
were<00:03:03.650> four<00:03:03.800> million<00:03:04.040> coins<00:03:04.310> as<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:04.520> say<00:03:04.730> I
