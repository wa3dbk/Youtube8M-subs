00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
very minimal time to you know you may

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.820 
very minimal time to you know you may
only<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> minute<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.719> two<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.170> switch

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
only have a minute or two to switch

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.039 
only have a minute or two to switch
between<00:01:05.010> djs<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> obviously<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> don't<00:01:06.900> want

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
between djs and obviously you don't want

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.410 
between djs and obviously you don't want
to<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.460> error<00:01:08.670> no<00:01:08.880> music<00:01:09.210> playing

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to have that error no music playing

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
to have that error no music playing
that's<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.840> good<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.979> customers<00:01:11.159> either

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that's not good for the customers either

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
that's not good for the customers either
so<00:01:12.260> this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> thing<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
so this is going to be a thing of the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
so this is going to be a thing of the
past<00:01:14.070> now<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> SL<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.560> dual

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
past now with the SL for and it's dual

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.179 
past now with the SL for and it's dual
USB<00:01:17.159> functions<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:17.970> each<00:01:18.900> DJ<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.740> plug

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
USB functions so each DJ can just plug

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.120 
USB functions so each DJ can just plug
in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> USB<00:01:20.580> cable<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.600> each<00:01:22.229> slat<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.650> that's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
in the USB cable in each slat and that's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
in the USB cable in each slat and that's
basically<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.299> plug<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.840> out

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
basically it so they can plug in and out

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
basically it so they can plug in and out
at<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> won't<00:01:26.280> disturb<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> mixer

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
at will and won't disturb the mixer

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
at will and won't disturb the mixer
anything<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> facilitate

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
anything so this is going to facilitate

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.719 
anything so this is going to facilitate
an<00:01:29.790> easier<00:01:30.180> switching<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.720> between<00:01:30.869> djs

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
an easier switching out between djs

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
an easier switching out between djs
which<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.509> how<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.750> save<00:01:33.930> us<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.380> time

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
which is in how to save us a lot of time

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.080 
which is in how to save us a lot of time
in<00:01:34.799> trouble<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.189> hassle<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.610> headaches<00:01:35.909> i

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
in trouble and hassle and headaches i

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.170 
in trouble and hassle and headaches i
think<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:37.229> SL<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.740> comes<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.340> april<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
think the SL for comes out in april the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.069 
think the SL for comes out in april the
map<00:01:39.570> price<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.140> 899<00:01:41.090> i<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
map price is 899 i do think that is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.670 
map price is 899 i do think that is
rather<00:01:43.320> high<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.979> most<00:01:44.850> people<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.259> so4

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
rather high for most people so the so4

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.660 
rather high for most people so the so4
is<00:01:46.770> probably<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.220> better<00:01:47.399> for

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
is probably going to be better for

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
is probably going to be better for
