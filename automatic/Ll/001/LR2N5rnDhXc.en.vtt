00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
I think it's kind of like the way people

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070 
I think it's kind of like the way people
also<00:01:25.950> tend<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.360> sit<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.810> front<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> the

also tend to sit in front of the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.630 
also tend to sit in front of the
computers<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.740> they<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:28.950> something<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
computers when they do something and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.030 
computers when they do something and
