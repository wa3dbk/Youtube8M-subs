00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.869 

I've<00:00:43.590> always<00:00:43.739> tried<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> don't<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.820> I've

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
I've always tried I don't think I've

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.819

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:59.319 
ever beaten any of the X or the regular
series<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> we'll<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.710> how<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> goes

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.599 

I<00:00:59.449> will<00:01:00.050> probably<00:01:00.409> trying<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.010> find<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.370> body

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
I will probably trying to find the body

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.369 
I will probably trying to find the body
parts<00:01:02.149> but<00:01:02.449> I'm<00:01:02.659> gonna<00:01:02.809> have<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.079> figure<00:01:03.260> out

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
parts but I'm gonna have to figure out

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.810 
parts but I'm gonna have to figure out
where<00:01:03.589> they<00:01:03.739> are<00:01:03.769> I<00:01:04.070> don't<00:01:04.369> remember<00:01:04.489> i'll

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
where they are I don't remember i'll

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.120 
where they are I don't remember i'll
 my<00:01:05.089> head<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.720> should<00:01:06.710> don't<00:01:06.860> think<00:01:07.040> I've

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
 my head I should don't think I've

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.920 
 my head I should don't think I've
ever<00:01:07.159> collected<00:01:07.729> all<00:01:08.000> those<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.540> any<00:01:08.689> of<00:01:08.840> the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
ever collected all those in any of the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.859 
ever collected all those in any of the
games<00:01:10.000> they're<00:01:11.000> always<00:01:11.180> been<00:01:11.420> concerned<00:01:11.659> with

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
games they're always been concerned with

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.450 
games they're always been concerned with
beating<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.290> game<00:01:12.530> before<00:01:12.710> trying<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.159> find<00:01:13.369> the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
beating a game before trying to find the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.560 
beating a game before trying to find the
secrets<00:01:15.759> while<00:01:16.759> depending<00:01:17.060> on<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> game

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
secrets while depending on the game

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.070 
secrets while depending on the game
anyway<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:22.520> i'll<00:01:22.759> probably<00:01:23.000> be<00:01:23.180> consulting<00:01:23.899> a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
anyway so i'll probably be consulting a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.289 
anyway so i'll probably be consulting a
guide<00:01:24.409> for<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:26.479> location<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.259> body<00:01:27.560> parts

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
guide for the location of the body parts

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.520 
guide for the location of the body parts
and<00:01:29.299> i'll<00:01:29.450> bother<00:01:29.600> telling<00:01:29.929> me<00:01:30.140> where<00:01:30.380> they

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
and i'll bother telling me where they

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.859 
and i'll bother telling me where they
are<00:01:30.560> because<00:01:30.920> i'm<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:31.250> going<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.659> record<00:01:32.659> all

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
are because i'm just going to record all

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.450 
are because i'm just going to record all
these<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:33.560> upload<00:01:33.890> them<00:01:34.159> in<00:01:34.280> one

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
these and then upload them in one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.490 
these and then upload them in one
massive<00:01:34.670> spree<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:35.750> it'll<00:01:35.929> be<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:36.080> little<00:01:36.140> late

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
massive spree so it'll be a little late

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:48.149 
massive spree so it'll be a little late
by<00:01:36.679> then<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.810> just<00:01:39.170> FYI
