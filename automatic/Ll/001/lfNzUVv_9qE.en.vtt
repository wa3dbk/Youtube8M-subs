00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.270
 all this time I was an administrator 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.700
 official community Luntik VKontakte 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.679
 actually besides being me 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.380
 mistake confused with the chief designer 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.540
 apple i am the main game designer 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.570
 new hit which we recently 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.180
 announced for you today from your 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 permissions i will give comments to the trailer 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 which once again will force you out 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.560
 drool monitor well or into your 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.929
 girl if you are autistic and see our 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.090
 date trailer this time we 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.340
 completely revised our concept 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.040
 the legendary series and the team decided 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.559
 that the main character should speak and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.100
 standard dog millionaire future 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.629
 hollywood star and the easiest 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.520
 promising dog in the world by name 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.460
 mukhtar mukhtar voice well done money 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 the table seems to me that our users 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.559
 for a long time wanted to see such a fallout 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.719
 which one would like to watch out for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.030
 the outcome of the plot and just play with 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.850
 pleasure unfortunately this time we 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.760
 stupidly made stalker with graphics gta 5 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.640
 air ships from Icarus online and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.880
 zombie and sniper or where is Hitler zombie 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 and his nation brothers are also in ours 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 trailer and debuted 1 career runaway 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.350
 111 from the asylum is surprising to him 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 there was a voice therefore personally my 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.240
 the decision was to leave it specifically for 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.490
 this scene and not anymore because i 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.909
 seems to add the main character voices 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.610
 it is already too of course I forgot 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.009
 mention the fact that all editions to us 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.799
 rated 10 out of 10 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.380
 but 30 hours after passing 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.420
 our game will take place at them Montenegrin and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 they will understand that the plot of the game 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 can even retell a child who 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.740
 stitches are usually told 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.649
 in literature at this particular moment we 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
