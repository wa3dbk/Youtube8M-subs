there<00:03:37.150> looks<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.930> me<00:03:38.080> like<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:39.239> potpourri<00:03:40.239> of

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
there looks to me like a potpourri of

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.240 
there looks to me like a potpourri of
hybrid<00:03:40.900> so<00:03:41.170> I'm<00:03:41.260> not<00:03:41.380> going<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.709> cut<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:42.040> back

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
hybrid so I'm not going to cut that back

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.360 
hybrid so I'm not going to cut that back
out<00:03:42.489> I'm<00:03:43.120> not<00:03:43.420> going<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.810> cut<00:03:44.019> that<00:03:44.380> back<00:03:44.739> now

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370

you might do if you have a very cold
climate<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:16.930> might<00:04:17.140> cover<00:04:17.530> your

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
climate is you might cover your

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.069 
climate is you might cover your
sarracenia<00:04:18.430> with<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:18.820> cloth<00:04:19.180> or<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.959> the

not that the frost and ice will

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.840 
not that the frost and ice will
necessarily<00:04:25.930> kill<00:04:26.620> them<00:04:26.890> but<00:04:27.400> they'll<00:04:27.610> die

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
necessarily kill them but they'll die
