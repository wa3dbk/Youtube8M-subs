00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.590
 and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.119
 and how about code people facilitate 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.169
 welcome to the introduction of one of 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.930
 the new courses this course looks for that 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.660
 you learn to develop a game 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.359
 using html5 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.640
 the intention of the course is divided into 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.360
 two parts number one that all you learn 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.040
 to create games for the web games this 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.129
 run on any device 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.900
 using modern browsers without the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.590
 because they do not require the need for 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.160
 no plugin 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.810
 for this it is worth mentioning that the owner 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.940
 the owner of the games market 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.890
 inside the web had been flash today in 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.600
 day those on mobile devices in 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.059
 the smartphones on the tablets are not 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.239
 runs flash so the alternative 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.280
 is to use html5 and in particular the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.580
 canvas pencil that is the one we 're going with 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.770
 to be working during the course in 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.650
 number 2 that you can start in the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.770
 path of the development of many games 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.570
 people are studying or preparing in 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.580
 programming with the intention of in 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.280
 some time to devote to the development of 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.950
 games the game that we are going to develop 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.350
 It is quite simple because it pretends to be 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.140
 an introduction on the long road that 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.869
 is the development of games so 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.119
 that if your idea is to develop games and 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.340
 you have no idea how to start or any 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.250
 Game concept can be this the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.229
 course that you need even though 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.000
 that your intention is for example 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.130
 develop games for xbox or 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.220
 develop games for playstation no 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.070
 for the computer out or make games 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.020
 in 3d so to speak 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.240
 you can start with this so that 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.090
 you learn the basics for you to start 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.950
 and how good is the first step in the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 development of the games the course is going to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.409
 be quite interesting 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.109
 I highly recommend you now in the 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.960
 vacation take the time so that 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.819
 follow it so that perfections things 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.970
 that we are doing even improve the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.560
 final work that we're going to see 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.780
 and the game 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.840
 the game you can try it on 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.400
 address that appears on the screen is more 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.420
 here I am going to this I am running the game 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.599
 and well it's about the ships that 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.670
 you shoot you have a ship that goes to 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.769
 continue to control with the arrows of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.870
 the keyboards and you're going to be able to shoot 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.260
 messages there are collisions there are enough 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.269
 things that we will be learning the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.549
 course is going to be divided into two parts the 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.230
 first that are basics in canvas 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.720
 in case you have never heard of your life 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.290
 talk or you had not used canvas 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.060
 html5 let's see this basic drawings 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.550
 basic animations things like that 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 and some javascript with 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.100
 objects since they are arrangements and so on 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.470
 so that when we get to the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.290
 tutorial pretty much 20 it seems to me 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.820
 let's start to develop the game as 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.480
 that is, this is the final result 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.270
 this is going to be creating at the end of the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.220
 game then I invite you to see it 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.320
 Take advantage of the holidays to 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.470
 get started on the road of games 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.870
 I hope and if you like it and if and if you want 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.700
 comment on it in the video that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.590
 then let's do something more complex something 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.680
 for example with enemies that already have 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.629
 this with automata so to speak that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.030
 already interact in a more 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.670
 complicated with the user or something of three 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.980
 fingers to this free aaa suggestion is 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.810
 this is intended to be only the beginning 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.129
 the introduction to the development of 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.629
 this games if you want to contribute something if 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.849
 it seems to you that you have information that 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.230
 can serve the other users is 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.870
 the free to do so in the comments 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.629
 of the videos but if you have any doubts 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.989
 I suggest you do them in the fanpage of 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.180
 I facilitate code or account 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.489
 twitter with a mention to steal code 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.989
 facilitated because it is easier to draw the 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.720
 doubts you have to be checking all the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.070
 videos of the course then I send you a 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 I greet him and he hernandez I'm going to do your 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.800
 tutor I hope you like the course 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.800
 I hope that 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.410
 get some knowledge and good 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.390
 then this every day at nine o'clock in the 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.160
 tomorrow a new tutorial will come out 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.680
 so that by tomorrow at nine you have 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.600
 that is already having the second 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.740
 video if you're watching this later 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.300
 tutorial 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.190
 You can already check it in the list or visit 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.290
 code facilitated dotcom to see everything 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.680
 the course I send you a greeting many 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.680
 Thank you
