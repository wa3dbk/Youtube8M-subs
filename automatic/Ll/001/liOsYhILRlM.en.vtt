00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.820
 who I am 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.990
 hello guys welcome to a new one of is 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.510
 character finally this time in christian 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.240
 20 that the version of 79 already know that 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.490
 there is an improved version of 81 but 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.040
 obviously not worth a thousand coins or 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.230
 I was in the market when I made this 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.060
 this review so let's talk about the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.210
 20 yes it is worth less than a thousand coins 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.920
 or 1500 so base can be what you can 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.900
 allow and as we have seen the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.130
 pretty good physical attributes apart 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.020
 that has a tad speed has 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.430
 a lot of force does a closet 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 embedded as I will say at the end of the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.780
 review and there you are seeing good 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 some some pretty attributes 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.590
 good and as always we are going to 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 tell you about the best page of coins 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.340
 fast cheap reliable fusion I leave you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 the link in the description as always 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 with a discount code and well there 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 you are watching also bet 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
 Christianly not that in which 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 Christianly summarizes that then in force 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 and in an incredible definition people 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.420
 it seems that he buys 20 that thinking he's going 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.520
 to be a second lukaku and I think it's 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.050
 totally the opposite or is it a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 player who does have rhythm and how 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.940
 you see but he does everything he does not 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.310
 That is to say, it reaches the area 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.009
 it arrives just as it did 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.440
 romelu lukaku but at the time of 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.390
 finalize despite that there I give to 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.550
 stringer and such at the time of finalizing no 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.900
 it has nothing to do is a lot better 20 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.509
 that I personally liked 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.460
 much more than the other Belgian and I think 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.009
 which is one of the best strikers in the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.750
 premier I think that with this rich could 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.360
 make one of the best couples of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 front of the game and would not surpass 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.310
 the 10 thousand coins and the truth that good 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.270
 is that I really liked the truth 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.160
 people that I think are a good striker 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.409
 deserved full is always in good 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.450
 head position goes amazing 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.869
 the shot always releases a good 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.359
 You're never going to hit the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.740
 ball is going to stay there lentito nobody 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.350
 over a brutal team chemistry 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
 because playing the premium is Belgian and there 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 is not a built-in wardrobe the worst the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.690
 skill maybe not that it's a bit 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.580
 there when he starts to turn if 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.500
 besides and what I said I hope that I have 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.269
 liked we'll see you in the next one there 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.269
 is the little note of 20 that goodbye 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 and
