00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
it um and I don't like the fact that the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.270 
it um and I don't like the fact that the
amount<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.000> pay<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:40.079> only<00:02:40.260> get<00:02:40.500> 8.5

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
amount you pay and you only get 8.5

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.020 
amount you pay and you only get 8.5
ounces<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:42.359> it's<00:02:42.719> just<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.879> like

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
ounces and it's just like it's just like

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.309 
ounces and it's just like it's just like
seems<00:02:45.389> like<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> waste<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.989> money<00:02:46.109> especially

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
seems like a waste of money especially

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.929 
seems like a waste of money especially
when<00:02:46.739> other<00:02:47.040> places<00:02:47.549> um<00:02:47.700> other<00:02:48.530> products<00:02:49.939> have

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
when other places um other products have

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.030 
when other places um other products have
bigger<00:02:51.329> ones<00:02:51.599> for<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> same<00:02:52.139> amount<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.889> in

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
bigger ones for the same amount like in

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
bigger ones for the same amount like in
16<00:02:53.430> ounces<00:02:53.669> you<00:02:53.819> get<00:02:54.000> double<00:02:54.239> amount<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:54.810> i

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
16 ounces you get double amount so i

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.800 
16 ounces you get double amount so i
wasn't<00:02:55.500> liking<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.980> fact<00:02:56.159> that<00:02:56.370> um<00:02:56.810> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
wasn't liking the fact that um you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.979 
wasn't liking the fact that um you
didn't<00:02:58.019> get<00:02:58.139> much<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.469> this<00:02:58.590> um<00:02:59.489> i<00:02:59.959> might<00:03:00.959> try

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989
