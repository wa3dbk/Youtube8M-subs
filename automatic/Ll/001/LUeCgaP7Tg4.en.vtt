00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.750
 we want Ukraine to have access to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.530
 additional volume of gas and if they 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.420
 will be required 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.070
 as you all know natural gas 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.080
 transported show pro 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:27.419
 Yes, and Western Europe through Ukraine in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 Russia I was chosen the carousel that 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.750
 children voted, and even residents of Moscow and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.699
 St. Petersburg 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:41.910
 I'm sorry I do not really imagine what 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:44.129
 such an electoral roundabout I know at all 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.510
 you read it yourself are not very familiar with this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.309
 I will definitely clarify the term 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.620
 that is, you are sure that people did not drive 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 circle on toy horses you tearing off 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.270
 late yes no I think it is not 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.840
 about it they have there their methods of conducting 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.059
 election you all know victoria well and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 surely that when she was 23 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 For 8 months she lived on board 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.509
 Russian ship and maybe found out there 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.660
 certain lex would mean that 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.670
 Our prejudice relates to Russia 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.770
 filing on the drum two ships she could 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.040
 learn Russian profanity but 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.200
 she swore in English she ok 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.200
 I am already a bird 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.760
 can 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.760
 these photos will wait for all the world media 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.030
 they were a twitter and they are in 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.430
 open access in the pictures we see that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
 these people are judged by their appearance clearly 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.070
 have bugs russia 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.330
 and this you call evidence and 7 up 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.650
 12 years 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.810
 Well, you do not want to say that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.760
 us government battle and intelligence 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.920
 so on now depends on the photos to 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.290
 but posted on the internet these pictures 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.610
 sources conclusions do yourself you know 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.979
 comments of the Russian Deputy Prime Minister 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.840
 Dmitry Rogozin about sanctions in 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.940
 regards to the space program he 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.959
 offered us to deliver astronauts on 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.820
 ms with the help of trampoline 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.590
 it missed on the obvious that 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.050
 american russian projects in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.120
 space industry are interconnected and in 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.890
 actually give that after the sanction 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.840
 Russia will not continue to help you 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.090
 let astronauts let me 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.800
 got acquainted in more detail and it looks like 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.600
 will give them the opportunity to break through 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.590
 the industry is very entertaining 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.420
 comment was the next question but 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.860
 Still, you agree that the Russians 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.670
 have the right to demand money for 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.709
 goods sold 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.510
 matt i will happily handle this 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.489
 when I get back to my office 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.140
 is it a coincidence that the image of Ukrainian 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.000
 authorities sent troops east Ukraine 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.519
 immediately after the visit to Kiev from to 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.440
 put representatives of the United States I think 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.900
 sure you just repeat the words minister 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.130
 Foreign Affairs laurel was and again 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.230
 states of wine what is the next question head 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.510
 but you are sure that the instigators are 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.120
 separatists and nothing like coming 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.989
 from the pro Kiev forces as we see 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.480
 from incidents 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.880
 about whom we speak every day they 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.620
 seem always to be the instigators in 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.180
 the racks of his cars were discovered 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.950
 man-portable air defense systems in 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.170
 the general question is whether or not 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.570
 these people are journalists can so 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.850
 it is but a question to the house of what are you 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.620
 the us government believe some 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.900
 message or is it Ukrainian 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.360
 official authorities specifically confirmed 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.490
 you all this information and so reported 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.870
 our employees are in Ukraine from 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.840
 who have contacts with local 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.450
 by the authorities 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.849
 and they believe that all these messages that those 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.860
 people carried weapons all this true 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:51.890
 fight puts you there on twitter 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.230
 They said that Russian is the first shot 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.209
 I would rather like a serious accusation 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.250
 to know us do not seem reliable 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.920
 Russian statements that the aggressor was 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.870
 someone else or Ukrainians considering that 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.849
 It was the Russians who entered the base but Russia 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.590
 this did not declare she said it 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.230
 there was a provocation then as you claim 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.269
 that you obviously Russia and this, too 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.079
 mentioned think we are ready to go to 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.660
 the next question but accused Russia 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.760
 no explanations were given if you 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.010
 any concerns about possible 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.690
 interpretations conflicts or over 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.690
 nepotism in which you and often 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.310
 blame the Russians no he is a private person 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.979
 good but then Russian and Ukrainian 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.570
 oligarchs who control it all 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.360
 they are also private individuals 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.630
 correctly of course we would not 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.639
 regarding the same category to me 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.440
 I wonder if concerns about that 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.990
 how Russians and Ukrainians will accept you 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.260
 participation in this son of the usa vice president 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.160
 given the current situation there is no 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.160
 no worries
