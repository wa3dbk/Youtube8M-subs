would appeal to a new audience in the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.730 
would appeal to a new audience in the
case<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> reboot<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> mythology<00:01:10.619> and

case of reboot the mythology and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.460 
case of reboot the mythology and
foundation<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.670> strong<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.020> think

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
foundation is so strong that I do think

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.460 
foundation is so strong that I do think
that<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> would<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> shame<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> start<00:01:14.580> over

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
that it would be a shame to start over

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.520 
that it would be a shame to start over
so<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.680> way<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.130> fine<00:01:17.520> as<00:01:17.850> I'm<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> fan<00:01:18.659> not

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so in that way I'm fine as I'm a fan not

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
so in that way I'm fine as I'm a fan not
that<00:01:19.680> I'll<00:01:19.770> be<00:01:19.890> putting<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> costume<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:21.000> I

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that I'll be putting on a costume when I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.679 
that I'll be putting on a costume when I
go<00:01:21.240> outside<00:01:21.409> I'd<00:01:22.409> rather<00:01:22.650> do<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> inside<00:01:23.689> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
go outside I'd rather do that inside but

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.359 
go outside I'd rather do that inside but
my<00:01:24.780> point<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> time<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.130> see

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
my point is that by the time we see

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
my point is that by the time we see
these<00:01:26.520> films<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.119> decade<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.020> passed

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
these films a decade will have passed

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
these films a decade will have passed
since<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> cliffhanger<00:01:29.189> ending<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> last

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
since the cliffhanger ending to the last

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.140 
since the cliffhanger ending to the last
film<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:31.439> longer<00:01:31.860> gap<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.250> time<00:01:32.520> than<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
film a much longer gap of time than the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.760 
film a much longer gap of time than the
previous<00:01:33.570> four<00:01:33.840> years<00:01:33.869> we<00:01:34.229> experienced

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
previous four years we experienced

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830

times<00:03:28.590> better<00:03:28.799> than<00:03:29.040> most<00:03:29.250> movies<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:30.030> go<00:03:30.180> to

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
times better than most movies that go to

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.330 
times better than most movies that go to
the<00:03:30.450> theater<00:03:30.810> plus<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.530> new<00:03:31.680> Teenage<00:03:32.010> Mutant

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the theater plus the new Teenage Mutant

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.550 
the theater plus the new Teenage Mutant
Ninja<00:03:32.370> Turtles<00:03:32.579> was<00:03:33.390> made<00:03:33.630> with<00:03:33.780> only<00:03:33.900> 34

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
Ninja Turtles was made with only 34

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.039 
Ninja Turtles was made with only 34
million<00:03:34.799> dollars<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.549> got<00:03:35.910> back<00:03:36.090> 95<00:03:36.750> million

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
million dollars and got back 95 million

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.590 
million dollars and got back 95 million
so<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.859> isn't<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.220> huge<00:03:38.489> gamble<00:03:38.910> because<00:03:39.030> CGI

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
so this isn't a huge gamble because CGI

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.050 
so this isn't a huge gamble because CGI
movies<00:03:39.810> are<00:03:40.109> cheaper<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.680> make<00:03:40.859> heck<00:03:41.489> Jim

after a certain amount of time I mean we

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.550 
after a certain amount of time I mean we
already<00:07:07.819> kind<00:07:08.180> of<00:07:08.240> plateaued<00:07:08.690> but<00:07:08.960> that's

already kind of plateaued but that's

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.260 
already kind of plateaued but that's
okay<00:07:09.919> the<00:07:10.129> show<00:07:10.310> has<00:07:10.490> it<00:07:10.759> could<00:07:10.909> go<00:07:11.060> sideways

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
okay the show has it could go sideways

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.290 
okay the show has it could go sideways
it<00:07:11.659> doesn't<00:07:11.900> have<00:07:12.050> to<00:07:12.229> go<00:07:12.349> up<00:07:12.530> or<00:07:12.680> down<00:07:12.909> so<00:07:13.909> so

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
it doesn't have to go up or down so so

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.270 
it doesn't have to go up or down so so
yeah<00:07:14.509> I<00:07:14.900> would<00:07:15.169> absolutely<00:07:15.620> love<00:07:15.949> to<00:07:16.099> hear
