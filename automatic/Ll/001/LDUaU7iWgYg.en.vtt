00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello my name is edward and today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.740
 I will show how to make the magicians out of the game 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.740
 assassin's creed 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.490
 Tomahawk we will have a souvenir therefore 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.710
 let's make it from wood for a start 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.450
 you need to take a screenshot and print 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 This picture or can take in group 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 VKontakte there will be full sizes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.340
 then you need to move it 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.170
 the image on the tree will be easier 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.300
 do by copying if you have 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.070
 there is no carbon paper you can just cut 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.540
 then attach to the tree and just 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.290
 circle in a tree, it is desirable to choose 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.640
 thicker 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.739
 now we have the most difficult 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.300
 you need to cut out the work yourself you helped 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.580
 can basically use any 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.620
 ways to jig saw bormashinku 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.129
 saw anything just langelovo 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.129
 doctor 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.370
 and so in general, finally I did cut it 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.410
 turned out to be much more complicated than I thought 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.260
 of course itâ€™s not quite perfect 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.550
 but in principle, the NATO mages seem altogether 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.160
 Here are my three parts 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.870
 turned out we will connect them on screws 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.030
 and we will get reliable magicians 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.950
 I'll also paint it for him 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.390
 shoelaces in general it will look like 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.900
 real magicians out of the game 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.900
 assassin's creed 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.500
 so I connected the three parts like this 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.840
 It looks like the magicians principle perfectly 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.880
 suitable for wetting gopnik lower 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.940
 Part of the tomahawk I was going to paint in black 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.940
 Colour 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:15.709
 in the upper part of the tomahawk I wipe myself 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:15.709
 the top of the film is coated with clear varnish. 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.490
 and so I got a real 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.140
 tomahawk assassin 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.510
 assassin which is quite long 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.290
 enjoyed this tomahawk now need 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.290
 try it out 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.710
 all your grandmothers 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.120
 went to the creation of this tomahawk and now 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.120
 we will check how he helped 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.840
 well then how did you see this then magicians 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.980
