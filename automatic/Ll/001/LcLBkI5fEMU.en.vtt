 the fairing is already with us and for all 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.940
 those people who want those tips 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.070
 of beauty because it arrived on Monday with the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.970
 fairing welcome as always to the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:25.140
 three thanks nene who is already doing 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.720
 much need to attend to better talk about 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.189
 beauty and let's talk about so many products 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.859
 that have come out there are times do not know what 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 buy what shampoo with salt that without salt 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.480
 what is the difference between a shampoo 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.450
 with salt or one that does not then one that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 come as the traditional look 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 unfortunately right now 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.800
 or fortunately, there is a lot 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.770
 variety of shampoo and with so much 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 saturation of products sometimes let's say 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 they wrap a little bit of people and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.050
 people get too confused when it comes to 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.730
 buy the shampoo then I what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.579
 I want to explain and hopefully, suddenly 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 this explanation will help them and it is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.660
 that we at the time of buying a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820
 shampoo first we have to define in 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.780
 our hair class does not buy a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.150
 product because it's fashionable 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.619
 I will specify for example if it is a 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.259
 oily hair if it is a dry hair if 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.720
 it is a thin hair will be very fine if 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.640
 it is a thick hair if it is a hair 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.009
 that is mistreated if it is a hair that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.080
 has dye then you have to classify 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.229
 first what is the product that we should 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.790
 use and spin the texture of our 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.979
 hair and the first I have to know 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.780
 and to know well is what kind of hair I have 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.149
 I true and how I realize 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.680
 good is not very simple because 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.750
 Normally when it is a greasy hair 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.479
 because the root starts to saturate a lot of 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.289
 fat and you have to wash it often and 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.210
 this makes the shampoo have to be 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.100
 recommended for oily hair but 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.250
 let's say emphasis then on what is 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.210
 the shampoo with and without salt the shampoo with 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.060
 salt what it does is it has a let's say 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.460
 the salt makes it more homogeneous 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.800
 the shampoo of a more texture because in addition 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.159
 is for more foam then what happens 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.829
 the shampoo with salt is ideal for 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.030
 oily hair because today by the 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.030
 saturation pollution 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.020
 fastest among the oily hair is 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.780
 very important that they do not use shampoo 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.030
 without salt but with salt the fatty shampoos 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.680
 it's with salt precisely because the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.110
 shampoo with salt when making foam 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.670
 as you say it's going to be a sweep and it's going to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.590
 be an exfoliation on the leather 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 scalp will then clean up a lot 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.770
 plus the scalp 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.020
 another thing that can happen with the shampoo 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.400
 sheen are the mentions that can happen 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.750
 with the salt-free shampoo, I love you 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.640
 remember all our viewers 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.260
 if you want these tips and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.090
 many more but also take out the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.710
 better advantage of that is what then 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.990
 they have to go to the premium hairdresser 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.970
 led by the fairing and all team 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.830
 of work that is wonderful the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.730
 premium hairdressing that there is on all the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.760
 avenue of las vegas 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.500
 in yumbo de las vegas easy to arrive 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.540
 is cerquita the AyurÃ¡ station can 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.120
 enter the metro has parking and 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.090
 truth that I do not know me since it is known 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120
 change by what they know and 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.120
 know me stay 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.680
 quickly and quickly then to 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.300
 let's make a conclusion for the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.380
 unsalted shampoo for people who 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.860
 have 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.330
 Fatty forgiveness with salt for that too 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.310
 you have to keep in mind that you can 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.990
 produce a little bit of dandruff sometimes in 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.390
 the scalp in case it appears 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.520
 dandruff can be the shampoo with salt and without 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.740
 salt is very good for people who 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.230
 They have dyed hair because that makes 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.870
 a very gentle wash for people 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.430
 who have the hair let's say 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 channeled also makes the product 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.800
 more because the sweep 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.560
 then it will help decrease the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.810
 frizz the with salt activates suddenly a 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.630
 little bit of frizz then let's say that the 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.760
 benefit of without salt is pretty but 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.280
 we have to keep in mind that everything 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.620
 this does almost foam if if does 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.620
 foam is because it really does not have the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.840
 salt and in conclusion what salt does 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.450
 in a shampoo is to give more consistency 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.390
 so that it generates more foam then the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.730
 washing is much stronger with salt and very 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.170
 soft without salt for example if I have the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.540
 oily hair but also this 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.760
 content I can mix the chapu 2 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.920
 to Monday I bathe with no salt and the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.960
 Wednesday I bath with wang hard staff 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.550
 that's why you have to identify what 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680
 said 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.530
 Initially if you have dyed hair 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.349
 Ideally, buy a shampoo 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.180
 for hair had they come already with 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.729
 the specifications and components 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.889
 ideal for a hair having the theme 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.449
 so that it lasts more perfect goodbye here 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.919
 we always attend so much with you 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.919
 he wants so much you too
