see i use this navigator and some rest
on<00:01:22.200> power<00:01:22.469> and<00:01:22.939> mems<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.149> got<00:01:24.359> to<00:01:24.630> add<00:01:25.320> this

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
on power and mems you got to add this

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.480 
on power and mems you got to add this
ray<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.149> when<00:01:27.719> you<00:01:27.810> click<00:01:27.929> it<00:01:28.170> it'll<00:01:29.130> fly<00:01:29.429> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
ray and when you click it it'll fly to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.819 
ray and when you click it it'll fly to
the<00:01:29.700> Ray<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.719> pretty<00:01:30.840> cool<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.380> hit<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the Ray so it's pretty cool I hit a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.419 
the Ray so it's pretty cool I hit a
target<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.799> as<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.859> add<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.850> ray<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.630> fly<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
target so as you add this ray you fly I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.060 
target so as you add this ray you fly I
think<00:01:38.429> it<00:01:38.609> is<00:01:38.780> 100<00:01:39.780> blocks<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.409> let's<00:01:40.710> check<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
think it is 100 blocks so let's check it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.620 
think it is 100 blocks so let's check it
out<00:01:41.159> oh<00:01:43.009> yeah<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.219> more<00:01:44.609> than<00:01:44.789> 100<00:01:45.630> blocks<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
out oh yeah it's more than 100 blocks is
