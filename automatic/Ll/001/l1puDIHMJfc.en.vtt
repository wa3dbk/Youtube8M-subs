00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.799
 the jewel the rain 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.209
 Speak, people 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.660
 Thinking right here with another video 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.570
 Good for you and today I 'm here I go 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.419
 bring some tips to 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 how to play well be in the strike locate 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.739
 and to start and I'll give you the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.680
 class tip that you can use to 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:35.129
 remington with nozzle brake and look at 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 laser and with the pecs marathon serve 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.160
 fast deadly silence the tiÃª and focus is 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.530
 a good class to use here some 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.159
 out and a good class of climbing would be 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.289
 limit with the same up times here - 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.320
 red dot suffered from fred nozzle 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.499
 front wiper with prep 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 agility marathon mira steady silence 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.449
 and foci in amplifying stock 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.969
 these things only in any kind of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.970
 explosive because this game havoc 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.340
 mainly shields the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.040
 I play and I do not like it so let's go 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.979
 I'm going to look for a match here and I'm going 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.840
 see if it works or not , and this class 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.899
 I just thought that a game I'm going to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 start playing here with remington 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.049
 here in my class to imitate 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.119
 she argued she is good but when you 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.860
 wants to be a bit defensive because you 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.590
 manages to kill them long distance 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.539
 but it's a fast class you get to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 Pretty fast places with her that I go 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.070
 get there in no time without giving 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.380
 the enemy's time to get ahead and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.789
 That's why I use fast classes already 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.640
 I'll go there in the front 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.020
 it was a window man I came 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.469
 first that it why it is good're 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.259
 using marathon and oh you see the other one ready 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.299
 already the cleaning area will go up here she 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 It is good for it is not you are targeted 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.369
 in a place and just go out killing with her 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 now I'm going to plant here and I'm going to stay 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.000
 alternating round I'll play with 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.969
 imitate the other where I'm going to play with 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 remington are two very good classes 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.960
 for those who like another salt another 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.720
 upload can use and use the same 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.480
 attach the same close only change a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 and now just defend here guys a tip 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.020
 for you 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.700
 at the time you are playing whether it's in 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.920
 pump time do not try to search 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.210
 here but defend the bomb let the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.980
 guys come up 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.810
 which is not now I let the guy come 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.180
 I could run back up very well. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.400
 but it is he who has to come from Fusar 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.230
 My part I already did I got planted 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.100
 now it's his turn to do his part. 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.140
 and I came here for the Fusari I did here 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.180
 the fault 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.640
 I carried the face with nothing for 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.740
 cni classes and now in this other 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.860
 start of round I'll put the imitate 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.600
 for us to see if it works I will also 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.640
 do the same way with only alencar 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.070
 I'll be much faster because the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.260
 touch with auschwitz what he asks 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.270
 you get lighter and I put the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.800
 marathon then these two packages 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.420
 combined make you as infinitely 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.340
 much faster 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.830
 so much that the sniper did not even get me 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.780
 I'm already here on their post and I'm 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.170
 I'll see if I can funk a guy. 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 up here I'll pick up the stairs 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.950
 silence is essential here for 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.380
 play six without it is impossible you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.670
 play well and the guys come running 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.590
 nor crazy that I do not even need 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.380
 amplify so they can listen to them 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.030
 do not use and cold amplify because 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.490
 anything you do 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.640
 Guys are going to blame the amplifier. 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:36.300
 a vector listening to a guy who's already arrived 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.900
 jumping he was smart but gon fight 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.300
 for the way we run though it always tries 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.030
 plant the bomb when you see 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.040
 that the number of enemies is less than 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.800
 your friends or I have two here 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.710
 I live one there so I'll always plant 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.290
 remembering it and I'm going to plant it and go 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.090
 look for a place where I can only stay 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.070
 listening if the guy is disarming me 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.380
 I do not intend to kill him, I'm going to be alone. 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.970
 Take care of the bomb, I'll stay here on the river. 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.600
 a very good place to listen to the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.490
 bomb I'll just stay here would be 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.670
 disarm I'll listen because it makes a 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.410
 huge noise just get there and kill him 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.900
 No problem 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.000
 do not try to stroll and pump 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.020
 not carol obviously he will see you and will 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.520
 kill you 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.890
 schmidt already killed it here beauty 2 to 0 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.190
 no longer see if I can do 14 to 0 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.190
 on here 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:37.210
 melody anp they go to the next 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.570
 round now I'm going to play with a rock site 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.880
 I'll use my ruler in tone though 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.710
 nobody the bomb that I always like 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.330
 get the bomb that gives enough point and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.190
 takes up real fast 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.350
 closing the road one of the ways that most 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.830
 the pope and seek to rescue but this 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.510
 here is a little cooler than it always is 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.480
 stay smart in that part because 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.070
 always someone appears to have already passed me a 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.360
 on a guy over there . 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.780
 beauty hotel I'll try to plant here I 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.270
 I already saw that the team has already killed him enough. 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.700
 of the enemy one to see if I can plant 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.030
 always look how many are alive and ready 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:20.770
 they killed a lot I'll always plant 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.900
 Be smart, you do not have a face plan anymore. 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.480
 depending on the map are obviously you 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.370
 they will die 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.140
 Now just wait or is not advancing 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.400
 stay in a place just waiting forever 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.810
 protected the pump has to be aware of 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.660
 game also where you think the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.550
 Dude, it's going to be cool, man. 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.950
 probably he will want to go back will 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.160
 go out that door, another surety 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:48.070
 I'll even look at the notion of game now he 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.570
 will want there in the truck 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.030
 there is always have the best sense of the game 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.190

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:09.100
