00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.829
 every child when the one we describe presents spelling mistakes on the scene 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.210
 not part of the process 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.169
 bete relativity 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.789
 I will not change 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.519
 the activity 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.560
 is inescapable 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.090
 during this concession process described the child goes through several 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.399
 hypotheses 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.399
 the first one 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.800
 and neither in which the bedding years does it prescribe is the lack of an hour 4 is trapped by the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.859
 disease are destroyed 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.480
 taubatÃ© sp 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 to mark the date 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.150
 in the big cities 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.310
 it can be traced that it was true you can seal Mecca 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.060
 the bet your voters prescribe 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.900
 but at that moment she believes that we use for each syllable a letter 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.120
 the square elected can be described it can be sealed to accommodate sonorous 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.250
 and samer she still keeps believing here for every gentile syllable one 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.090
 reading more seriously it relates the sound of the reading or with the vowel or the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.340
 constant 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 for example a child with Asian team with ball only at the time word 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.270
 horse would put the readings to 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.540
 At her house, she said on her lap, I'm going to go there, my foot for slaughter. 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.600
 the written piece in which the child shows sketches are the fault of the ethics 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.259
 she already begins to realize that for each syllable people need two readings 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.310
 if we break the word child bat it can write the ine or 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.950
 forgot him 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 write is that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.710
 frog 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 and finally the child presents alphabetic writing 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.030
 but still presenting orthographic questions that will only be healed 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 during schooling and missed activities 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.729
 the new president and for us is to have 30 more for doctor 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.269
 it is intended in this way 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 I do not lay down on the lawn. 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.819
 the adult who can not write 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.470
 without very low self-esteem as well as the efficiency of the other also the case 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.049
 it seems the hypotheses described 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.180
 but with a differential he credits the success of a cultural baggage 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.459
