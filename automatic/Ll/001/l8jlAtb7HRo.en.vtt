00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.349
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.389
 another video on my channel and me 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.219
 have a colleague with me today that 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.070
 I you can imagine nevertheless 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.019
 jo i am the philipp of computer for 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.519
 life in a channel you can times 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.070
 I also watch gameplays and 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.019
 but that's what it's all about today 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.849
 what else is exactly what we do 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.500
 So does have philippines since me a tee 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.140
 it has to be provided 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.000
 I own a server of my own 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.160
 server was exactly where own server 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.200
 I thought that then cough a lot 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 cool yes exactly and yes he has me one 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.579
 tea it worried and we have one 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 a little bit around because of licenses has long 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.840
 lasted enough 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.850
 and yes we have a ts up now 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.230
 registered my name and indeed finds 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.510
 her ts under the ip furlong fonds.de 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.550
 So just in the search bar from ts 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.070
 how does that connect you go there 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.840
 Go exactly and just enter 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.899
 simply promote at the server address 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.660
 summarizes de yes yes tell me what else is there 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.700
 everything for special things so well 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.500
 Of course there are rules on this ts 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.900
 which are of course in each channel 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.970
 the yes you can read the then it will 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.860
 of course a so-called main room 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.230
 You can say, where to say the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.950
 depending on which players are chosen 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.080
 and we have 512 that is enough 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.700
 there's room for everyone so that should not be 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.410
 become scarce when the pink panther scarce 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.970
 500 creates then we should think so 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.860
 because not synonymous over it so come 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.780
 At the moment I do not believe that we 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.260
 because come in some way about it 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.910
 should be accurate 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.590
 yes so we have now of the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.620
 whole play inside black ops 2 or 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.150
 4 3 modern warfare 2 and depending if if 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.210
 She asks us something else 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.700
 but yes in principle is a 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.860
 right youtuber ts you can do it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.540
 not worth income yes depending on if 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.570
 i am online i am in the ts inside 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.940
 at least if I play and there could 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.470
 always dreaming and maybe I'm here 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.550
 Arrives then in time 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.160
 any event where i am again 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.310
 wants to record something with subscribers 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.750
 and yes it is a possibility as 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.970
 you can stop by the still 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.530
 so to speak , that's for the gamers 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.550
 just to gamble it come to 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.640
 Tying up and with your friends too 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.190
 keep talking 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.770
 the gamblers number in the number six 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.330
 That's what I think it'll be 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.880
 because their rest there too 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.850
 would not be otherwise, the six by six 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.700
 have 16 to clear and six guests 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.780
 rooms and yes we have too 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.970
 now also youtuber rooms 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.310
 that means if you have a tea 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.140
 it does not really need one and 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 You can have disposal with us 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.370
 Report and then get a password for 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.530
 dual where you could then push and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.970
 then quasi record where I have 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 then nobody can disturb because just 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.180
 the whole password is protected 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.880
 You just have to do that with one year 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 an admin who is online now 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.230
 if no one looks and is okay there goes 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.430
 but not if someone is online 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.510
 just sign up and then you can 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.500
 Request a password for one 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.140
 silent tool or disturbing people exactly 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.120
 So I think so I'm here 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.980
 probably quite often 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.260
 with the name philip see normal 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.000
 also at the server admins and at the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.970
 Symbols on other side means you 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 can then ask a red red eyes 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 square with a silver a inside 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.940
 exactly stands are just for admin re 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.239
 then because the advents have 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.820
 mostly 44 symbols at least me 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.470
 and then you can come to me 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.370
 and I correct that then one 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.280
 depending on what he needs exactly fits 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.810
 So you 'll be something else because 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.380
 definitely look over and yes 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.180
 exactly 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.220
 soon it will be a competition 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.840
 we have roxette 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.110
 a contact so I have one 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.880
 contact with another colleague 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.829
 built up and will soon be one 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.959
 Contest game in perspective so 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.209
 if you often stop by at ts or 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.070
 from time to time you will surely 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.690
 even in a raffle the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.209
 live yes somewhere in black ops 2 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.500
 some competition is taking place and yes 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.459
 may come indeed times as a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.200
 raffle concluded 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.450
 Of course, that is still developing 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.160
 but does not look so bad when 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.320
 I'll take a moment to win the game 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.660
 can explain very briefly and that 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.200
 the word is then about the size of one 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.289
 gamble on how many 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.760
 Customers now rocket through this 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.470
 I should say through this advertising goes 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.150
 it is almost made for it gets 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.950
 that means it can be quite a right 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 good keyboard 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.630
 his new and all possible ones then 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.700
 contain really great competition 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.380
 That's exactly what I'm doing 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.280
 I like many cool things 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.140
 can raise 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.270
 but yes as I said that is still clicks 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.750
 still in the near or distant future ever 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.240
 after this 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.070
 but yes I think that's now time 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.500
 from our side fits also time 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.090
 with five minutes good but yes good then 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.060
 I'll leave you the last word and me 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.140
 I'll go and say goodbye 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.140
 from you and yes
