00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello today we want you the new one 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.960
 rail segways radio central 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:17.750
 Imagine this is an ip based 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.910
 Alarmzentrale but actually on 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.039
 based system of the fixed sec trubel 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.130
 So the Eckdaten are identical what 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.900
 number of detectors and similar things 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.609
 simply add new features 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.920
 say e mail app control and everything 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.870
 what else with ip-based systems 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.960
 meanwhile standard is ip 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.879
 cameras and the like, we wanted to me 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.260
 Now just show how to do this 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.150
 central starts up 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.170
 we already have the central one here 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.409
 screwed up in front of us you see here and 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.830
 two holes each on the sides for 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.869
 the fixation of the central on the wall 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.610
 then most important for the 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.619
 Commissioning clearly the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.780
 supply of the system with electricity 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:06.680
 For this you have the 230 volt here 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.130
 connection next to the fuse the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.350
 we will insert now 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.750
 Here you have an extra 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.810
 connection for a 12 volt power supply resp 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.829
 13 8 volts around the plant above with 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.890
 supply electricity 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:27.020
 You still have a battery 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.060
 is in the scope of delivery the second 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.429
 can be purchased additionally 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.149
 others are on the board 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:38.200
 Wired outputs up here 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.689
 or the wired inputs below 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.490
 then we still have the network socket 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:49.969
 for connection to the network and 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.139
 next to it the a and b would come for the 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.880
 connection of analog wants gets so 

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:56.649
 when we connected everything so far 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.969
 to have 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.499
 We close at the end if you on the 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.960
 panel to the front and plates the 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.070
 central role 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.850
 We now have the plant up and running 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.009
 took 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.560
 Say she fell high and waits 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.880
 now only on the configuration 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.800
 if the owner of an eck are west 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.540
 or with the mind game one too 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.800
 buy or just at the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.780
 topic are interested 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.630
 there are more videos to 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.330
 Configuration and similar device 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.100
 possibilities come 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.260
 so I would ask you to subscribe 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.910
 Just enter our youtube channel and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.510
 they look what in the near future time still so 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.470
 comes in 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.470
 Until next time
