00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
accuracy now see this gun is probably

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.900 
accuracy now see this gun is probably
one<00:02:36.350> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> more<00:02:36.620> accurate<00:02:36.799> pistols<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.819> the

one of the more accurate pistols in the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.120 
one of the more accurate pistols in the
game<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:38.900> it's<00:02:39.200> definitely<00:02:39.530> not<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.980> most

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
game but it's definitely not the most

game but it's definitely not the most
accurate<00:02:40.310> um<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.600> another<00:02:42.110> for<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.440> fly<00:02:42.650> about

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
accurate um so another for the fly about

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.670 
accurate um so another for the fly about
life<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.330> didn't<00:02:44.690> save<00:02:44.870> my<00:02:44.959> score<00:02:45.260> it's

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
life and if I didn't save my score it's

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.570 
life and if I didn't save my score it's
