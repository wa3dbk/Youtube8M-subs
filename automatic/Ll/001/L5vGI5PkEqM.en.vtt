don't<00:04:42.220> know<00:04:42.280> why<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.490> would<00:04:42.610> take<00:04:42.820> in

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
don't know why you would take in

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.880 
don't know why you would take in
situation<00:04:44.020> where<00:04:44.110> you're<00:04:44.169> close<00:04:44.440> positions

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
situation where you're close positions

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.570 
situation where you're close positions
and<00:04:45.010> for<00:04:45.220> gate<00:04:46.169> that's<00:04:47.169> true<00:04:47.470> it's<00:04:47.650> just<00:04:47.710> you

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
and for gate that's true it's just you

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.219 
and for gate that's true it's just you
had<00:04:48.700> three<00:04:49.000> probes<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:49.570> minerals<00:04:49.780> at<00:04:50.080> one

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
had three probes up minerals at one

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.100 
had three probes up minerals at one
point<00:04:50.410> time<00:04:51.180> um<00:04:52.180> yeah<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:52.600> was<00:04:52.750> pretty<00:04:52.900> dumb

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
just kind of a sim could just be early

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:50.670 
just kind of a sim could just be early
pressure<00:05:18.740> no<00:05:19.740> that's
