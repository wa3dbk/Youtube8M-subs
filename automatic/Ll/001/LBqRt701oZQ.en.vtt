this<00:00:11.330> can<00:00:11.539> solve<00:00:11.809> some<00:00:12.110> of<00:00:12.200> your<00:00:12.289> fit<00:00:12.530> issues

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
this can solve some of your fit issues

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.070 
this can solve some of your fit issues
as<00:00:13.219> well<00:00:13.429> as<00:00:13.700> shortening<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:14.509> break-in<00:00:14.839> time

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
as well as shortening the break-in time

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.249 
as well as shortening the break-in time
resulting<00:00:16.040> in<00:00:16.160> a<00:00:16.250> nice<00:00:16.490> customized<00:00:17.090> fit<00:00:17.419> you

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:18.259 
resulting in a nice customized fit you

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:19.359 
resulting in a nice customized fit you
also<00:00:18.410> should<00:00:18.680> note<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:18.830> this<00:00:19.039> is<00:00:19.220> not<00:00:19.250> a

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
also should note that this is not a

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.580 
also should note that this is not a
necessary<00:00:19.669> process<00:00:20.539> some<00:00:21.230> players<00:00:21.439> will

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
necessary process some players will

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.810 
necessary process some players will
actually<00:00:21.859> prefer<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.310> break<00:00:22.460> them<00:00:22.609> in<00:00:22.699> the

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
actually prefer to break them in the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.300 
actually prefer to break them in the
more<00:00:22.970> natural<00:00:23.449> way<00:00:23.660> whereas<00:00:24.560> if<00:00:24.859> you<00:00:25.070> bake

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
more natural way whereas if you bake

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.279 
more natural way whereas if you bake
them<00:00:25.490> too<00:00:25.760> much<00:00:25.939> or<00:00:26.179> over<00:00:26.480> bake<00:00:26.660> them<00:00:26.869> it<00:00:27.050> can

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
them too much or over bake them it can

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.900 
them too much or over bake them it can
result<00:00:27.500> in<00:00:27.619> a<00:00:27.710> premature<00:00:28.250> breakdown<00:00:28.730> on<00:00:28.820> the

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
result in a premature breakdown on the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.790 
result in a premature breakdown on the
skate<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.960> essentially<00:00:30.439> what<00:00:30.529> we're<00:00:30.619> gonna<00:00:30.710> be

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
skate so essentially what we're gonna be

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.350 
skate so essentially what we're gonna be
doing<00:00:30.859> today<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.339> where<00:00:31.670> we<00:00:31.759> going<00:00:31.970> over<00:00:32.089> how

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
doing today is where we going over how

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.270 
doing today is where we going over how
to<00:00:32.390> heat<00:00:32.720> up<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.960> skate<00:00:33.230> out<00:00:33.739> of<00:00:33.830> the<00:00:33.890> material

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
to heat up the skate out of the material

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.650 
to heat up the skate out of the material
is<00:00:34.339> a<00:00:34.370> nice<00:00:34.580> soft<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.210> moldable

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
been in there too long so now during the

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.169 
been in there too long so now during the
baking<00:01:36.590> process<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.579> can<00:01:37.700> go<00:01:37.729> ahead<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:37.999> you

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
baking process you can go ahead and you

baking process you can go ahead and you
can<00:01:38.299> check<00:01:38.539> on<00:01:38.719> it<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.990> make<00:01:39.140> sure<00:01:39.170> that

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:39.499 
can check on it to make sure that

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.200 
can check on it to make sure that
everything<00:01:40.039> is<00:01:40.130> getting<00:01:40.219> heated<00:01:40.579> up<00:01:40.729> properly

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
everything is getting heated up properly

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.090 
everything is getting heated up properly
so<00:01:41.479> we're<00:01:41.960> just<00:01:42.079> gonna<00:01:42.170> go<00:01:42.469> ahead<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:42.740> open<00:01:43.039> it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100

up and pull the skate out we're going to
feel<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.670> material<00:01:46.929> see<00:01:47.929> how<00:01:48.049> it's<00:01:48.170> still<00:01:48.350> a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
feel the material see how it's still a

feel the material see how it's still a
little<00:01:48.590> stiff<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.340> we're<00:01:49.460> going<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.639> leave<00:01:49.729> it

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819
