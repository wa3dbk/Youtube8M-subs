iffy<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.310> wasn't<00:01:53.970> sure<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.570> I'd

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
iffy about that I wasn't sure if I'd

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
iffy about that I wasn't sure if I'd
like<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.920> actually<00:01:56.130> pretty

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
like it but it's actually pretty

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.609 
like it but it's actually pretty
comfortable<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.450> fine<00:01:57.630> and<00:02:00.469> honestly<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
comfortable it's fine and honestly the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.709 
comfortable it's fine and honestly the
main<00:02:01.799> reason<00:02:02.100> why<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.250> bought<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.719> was

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
main reason why I bought this was

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.700 
main reason why I bought this was
because<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.040> bars<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.119> HIC<00:02:06.990> compression

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
because the bars and the HIC compression

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.130 
because the bars and the HIC compression
that's<00:02:07.940> my<00:02:08.940> favorite<00:02:09.360> compression<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.840> had<00:02:09.989> on

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that's my favorite compression I had on

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.480 
that's my favorite compression I had on
my<00:02:10.170> last<00:02:10.440> scooter

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
my last scooter

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.180 
my last scooter
and<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.910> MGP<00:02:12.210> one<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.020> good<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.440> works

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and the MGP one is just as good it works

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.760 
and the MGP one is just as good it works
perfectly
