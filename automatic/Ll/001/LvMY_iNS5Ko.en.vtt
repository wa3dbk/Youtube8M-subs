I<00:01:22.290> considered<00:01:23.009> poison<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.610> offensive<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
proper removal is but I trusted it would

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
Genesis 1 it says that man is created in
God's<00:01:45.119> own<00:01:45.360> image<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> likeness<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.439> then

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
God's own image and likeness and then

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.010 
God's own image and likeness and then
you<00:01:47.070> might<00:01:47.250> say<00:01:47.430> but

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
you might say but

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.469 
you might say but
know<00:01:48.170> exactly<00:01:48.619> what<00:01:48.950> God<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.579> oh<00:01:49.880> no<00:01:50.179> Jesus

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
know exactly what God is oh no Jesus

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.630 
know exactly what God is oh no Jesus
told<00:01:50.810> us<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:51.170> Jesus<00:01:51.950> said<00:01:52.189> in<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.429> New

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
told us that Jesus said in the New

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.690 
told us that Jesus said in the New
Testament<00:01:53.210> God<00:01:53.329> is<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:53.990> spirit<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:54.920> if<00:01:55.219> God<00:01:55.520> is

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
Testament God is the spirit so if God is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.029 
Testament God is the spirit so if God is
a<00:01:55.729> spirit<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.469> madness<00:01:57.469> is<00:01:57.619> image<00:01:57.890> and

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
a spirit and madness is image and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.100 
a spirit and madness is image and
likeness<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.579> guess<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.420> fact<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.810> man<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.079> a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
likeness I guess the fact that man is a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.690 
likeness I guess the fact that man is a
spiritual<00:02:00.679> ideas<00:02:01.069> have<00:02:01.250> pretty<00:02:01.460> good

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
spiritual ideas have pretty good

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.690 
spiritual ideas have pretty good
definition<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.750> anyway<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.319> was<00:02:03.530> my

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
definition so anyway that was my

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.370 
definition so anyway that was my
prescription<00:02:04.700> that's<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.450> stayed<00:02:05.780> with<00:02:06.020> I

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
prescription that's that I stayed with I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.440 
prescription that's that I stayed with I
got<00:02:06.950> on<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.159> plane<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.670> plane<00:02:07.789> was<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.209> stop

with an ambulance

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.960 
with an ambulance
I<00:02:56.799> remember<00:02:57.799> thinking<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.340> point<00:02:58.790> that

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
I remember thinking at that point that

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.210 
I remember thinking at that point that
the<00:02:59.120> pilot<00:02:59.569> had<00:02:59.720> become<00:02:59.989> offensive<00:03:00.319> but<00:03:01.010> its

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
the pilot had become offensive but its

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.190 
the pilot had become offensive but its
removal<00:03:01.700> would<00:03:01.850> be<00:03:02.060> awkward<00:03:02.329> if<00:03:02.870> he's<00:03:03.019> gonna

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
removal would be awkward if he's gonna

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.559 
removal would be awkward if he's gonna
fly<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.470> plane<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.400> at<00:03:04.519> any<00:03:04.670> rate<00:03:04.790> by<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.239> time

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
fly the plane so at any rate by the time

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.160 
fly the plane so at any rate by the time
we<00:03:05.810> got<00:03:06.350> fairly<00:03:06.980> close<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.609> that<00:03:08.359> Texas<00:03:08.930> stop

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
we got fairly close to that Texas stop

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.020 
we got fairly close to that Texas stop
the<00:03:09.620> pilot<00:03:10.010> came<00:03:10.160> back<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.549> said<00:03:10.700> he<00:03:10.819> said

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
the pilot came back and said he said

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.520 
the pilot came back and said he said
it's<00:03:11.150> far<00:03:11.299> too<00:03:11.510> serious<00:03:11.930> for<00:03:11.959> them<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.350> take

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
it's far too serious for them to take

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.590 
it's far too serious for them to take
care<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.769> but<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.639> at<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.880> next<00:03:14.060> stop<00:03:14.389> in

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
care of but that at the next stop in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.780 
care of but that at the next stop in
Phoenix<00:03:14.959> there's<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.230> large<00:03:15.470> poison<00:03:16.010> center<00:03:16.310> so
