00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 hi, you finally have a rain drop 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.139
 in February 28th then the day of 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.500
 my birthday and I take this opportunity to do 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.689
 in short, you are reusing a vase 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.090
 of plastic bottles can be 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.439
 also used as a brush holder or 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.820
 with many other ways 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.220
 always our imagination from study 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.789
 I show you the curves and all the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.500
 steps 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.340
 here's what you need for this new one 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:41.129
 design a plastic bottle a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.100
 punch a ribbon pendant or 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.829
 lace and scissors 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 we start immediately after rinsing the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 your bottle and prove possible 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 labels let's make a line with 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.219
 the pencil and this will be our point 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.659
 reference for the cutting that will take place 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:13.520
 precisely with scissors I do first 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.520
 a little hole and then slowly 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:28.290
 cut do not worry if the cut 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:50.040
 it won't be decided because now we can 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:55.190
 go a little to fix it and with but paper 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.190
 glass will go to fix the burgundy 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.180
 once polished we can go to 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.830
 use our for punctures we must 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.080
 do this a little strength usually 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.000
 is used for paper but us 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 we're going to use it for plastic is 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.240
 so simple it fits then me 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:33.810
 I will keep a little on the upper edge 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:38.250
 after which I will go first this way and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:49.680
 I will continue along the whole edge hear 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:52.230
 with the same procedure and continuous 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.350
 so filters perforate the entire edge 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.090
 I can go to decorate in this case 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.370
 I did it using lace 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.850
 you can very well use the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.280
 leftover tape or even draw 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.000
 something why not then I go to 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000
 take the lace 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.080
 and he knows it in this way 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:23.000
 stopping it with a little glue and 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.000
 I will therefore use this pattex 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.599
 go then to put a central strip 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:52.030
 but it does not stop it with glue but rather 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:55.260
 with a bow in which I will then insert later 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.260
 my pendant 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.420
 and here he does it as I had shown 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.060
 video start 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.849
 this is not the end result 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.699
 obviously difficult to achieve as 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.139
 always the april photos videos on instagram 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.720
 ae on facebook 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.070

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.199
