00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.990
 that all the people 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.990
 good is connected to the current 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.180
 everything was from this one and it's working 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.850
 I have the fan, those are the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.650
 connectors which showed 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.410
 previous ideas where I put the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.140
 Lantern 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.350
 and here I made some good new ones 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.350
 connectors 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.010
 since it is the cable 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 liqueur 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.570
 I'm here I connect to any client 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 can do here 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.160
 and here is my mercy 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.010
 same with the same connector the 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.089
 connectors 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.800
 so this does not go away like that they just have 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.610
 a handle on the inside and also 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.330
 I will teach how to wait for liquor 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.330
 we connect it there 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 and obviously that when I activate the pedal 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.140
 here is 12 volts no 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.140
 let's connect this machine 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.350
 how can you see 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.310
 the red machine 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.310
 when I activate it 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.200
 where 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.740
 but we will be able to give you a little more 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.630
 s 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.450
 we adjusted a little 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.110
 and so to be able 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.520
 two 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.520
 It is true 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.500
 ah 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.659
 Well now I'm going to take it apart so that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.659
 see how a machine is put together 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.659
 professional 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.080
 they are all Chinese 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.410
 why I do not recommend 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.340
 I prefer to make my own machines 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.340
 like this seaweed 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.570
 with this 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.570
 what do i have to do 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.709
 I already have my measure the toecaps 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.220
 I have masks all the inks 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.950
 and this is my little machine, like this one 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.950
 here if I stay 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.060
 because it's too much concert martin 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.000
 I connect it 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.290
 as you will see the sound is different but it 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.290
 works much better with that 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.040
 good in a video taught how to put together 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:15.250
 this type of machines today I'm going to 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.410
 teach how to arm is here 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.470
 Now I'm going to take it apart and I'm going to 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.700
 say part by pair how it is 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.330
 as we see it is already disarmed they are all 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.330
 the reels 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:38.240
 I think even the cable is thinner 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.980
 is more prone to burn because of that 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.980
 I recommend this type of wire 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.550
 he is hungry here 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:50.550
 you can see is twice the thickness 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.910
 I do not think you can see it but 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.030
 and I think it's number 29 of the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.050
 coils of wire number 24 what I 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.420
 I recommend 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.980
 is 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.370
 here we have for a coil 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.990
 I need about 50 grams more to 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.700
 do the other thing very well but let's give another 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.910
 ghubn that I will soon teach 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.840
 how coils are made 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.920
 in video no longer in good photos these of 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.360
 here are insulation washers all case 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.360
 plastic washers 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.389
 there are 42 for each end there is the 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.389
 frame 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.560
 the washer goes a here 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.190
 another here at the two ends of the 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.800
 coils in this end of here and in this 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:57.129
 end of here in these two must of 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.169
 have insulation washers 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.169
 good as here we have placed here 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.650
 this one here 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.650
 goes here 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:22.250
 this here also here 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.250
 let's see we're going to place the coils
