00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:10.910
school well the Charlie Worthington here

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.820
don't like grilling fish scare you
simple and show you how

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.040
got this grilling fish first things
first

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.700
you wanna preheat your grill to medium
heat but eight to ten minutes we've

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.440
already done that

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.420
you want to brush it clean the salmon
steaks have been on cooking it's about

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.270
46 minutes per half inch

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.550
these again are stakes those around them
better cuts for grilling

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.239
their cut cross grain the whole together
little bit better they'll flake apart as

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.090
much he said the skin to hold them
together

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.640
we're gonna try somehow fillets on as
well before we do that we're gonna

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640
spritz the grow

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.640
you can brush with olive oil use a grill
spray and the to laser a little bit more

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.120
tricky because again they have a
tendency to flake apart a bit

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.750
but if you leave me alone I'm said don't
turn to quickly

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.970
the salmon steaks have been on long
enough for gonna take them off

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.450
again remember never take your need of
and put it onto a platter that you've

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.750
taken raw fish offal

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.560
so these are ready to go

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.620
think those off to the side

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.280
again you wanna let this cook again half
an inch

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.570
four to six minutes if you're
intimidated by the fillets

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.690
anyone make sure that they don't like a
part you can use one of these it's a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.620
grill basket

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.810
just open it up you for your fish in
close it up

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.170
slide your hand one is put on the grill
and you cook efficient just like you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.240

attorney you never gonna have a problem

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.650

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.650
for show you how to cook some fish in a
packet get yourself outside still up the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.070

more by steaming poaching forget some
fish are season with some cracked pepper

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.650

with whatever you want to get some time

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.460
from the garden

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.020
play those on here then you could use
phase linkages tarragon

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.570
still in this is also gonna wrap this up

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.720
it's gonna take again about 12 minutes
on this can depend on the thickness the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.310
fish

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.120
