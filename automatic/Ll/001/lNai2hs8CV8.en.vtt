00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.290
 very good morning that I am pau domÃ©nech 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.200
 of the canine psychology variety and today 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.629
 He wanted to share with us what is my 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.100
 method to prepare prizes for 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.100
 the sessions also accomplices 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.029
 nothing first comment that there 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 many videos because I had to see 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.220
 that those who prioritize things like that was 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.460
 a cookie or the prize be with is more 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.579
 big better 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.960
 against more ingredients come better not 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.210
 I see that they focus on things that are not 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.160
 really so important in my opinion 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.899
 what's really important to work 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.850
 sessions directly with our dog 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.800
 would be two characteristics the first 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.930
 that the prizes are relatively 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.150
 small is the size of a fingernail 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.930
 size once removed something small 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.930
 so the dog can digest it 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.960
 also throw away since that makes lose a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.970
 precious time and therefore the connection 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 through our channel and secondly 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.750
 it would be that it was not dehydrated food 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.970
 type I think type cookies I see it a lot 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.070
 the truth is that the same thing is happening 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.720
 before to have to chew the hill 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.890
 he loses concentration and is no longer 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 joined us in the exercise as 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.210
 could add a last one that would be that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.710
 they were tasty we bought better but 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.930
 without forgetting the first two 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.930
 characteristics and in general 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.390
 Nothing what we should do 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.549
 we should do is go to a supermarket 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.990
 and buy some sausages you do not need 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.969
 which are the most expensive I buy from 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.289
 the cheapest because otherwise I would not win 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.179
 for prizes and they work for me 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:50.090
 perfectly good and we bought some 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.950
 parquet sausages once we have the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.479
 sausage on the wooden table 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.649
 with the knife prepared what 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.710
 so we would do is cut 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.509
 cross-section is valid for as we said 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.479
 that 'the size of the awards is not 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.850
 too big is worth once we have it 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.250
 separated in two halves we started it with 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.750
 a left hand and with the right-handers and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.880
 with the right one we proceed to cut 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.959
 well chunks no matter what they are 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.160
 exactly the same but good 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:19.810
 we will try to make it as equal 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:22.210
 possible 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.880
 78 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.800
 nine and ten we got 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.080
 with this it is worth, we have twenty 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.120
 awards and now I will explain a little bit 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.000
 because the issue of cutting it into sell 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.950
 everything but in 22 in 18 and dinner to cut it 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.470
 in ten pieces equally others by 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.260
 rather, it's because I like it 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.430
 work in sessions of 10 repetitions 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.100
 since it is much easier to carry the 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.200
 percentage of success of the dog 170 a 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.540
 90 percent success are times 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.700
 summer then how do I eat it 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.640
 we would do since I also like and 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.220
 actually it should be carried in a 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.050
 notepad or on a sheet annotated the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.210
 fronts of success and the evolution of 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.470
 our glue we recorded it from a 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.810
 Easy way to not have to go 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.700
 pointing out if you hit in the certain what 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.320
 which would be nonsense but it takes 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.660
 a lot of time and it would be because it takes 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.910
 Looser out in the will so 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.300
 what are we going to catch and put on 10 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.300
 10 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.260
 but good 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.440
 the two artists we have in hand 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.600
 we have in your pocket 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.760
 10 in this way that we get and 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.760
 I begin to imagine that I am working 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.520
 so 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.790
 he sits 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:03.240
 he sits we give him many sessions and he does not 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.610
 we know how many times 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.590
 approached repetitions 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.930
 we have ten points in the hand 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.490
 ok we just have to be aware 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.830
 of the mistakes of our dogs not 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.500
 count how many should our dog in 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.340
 a session of 10 attempts we have counted 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.640
 two failures we will stop that session because 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.640
 we will have arrived 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.270
 that is a very simple way to be able 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.539
 keep track and not go lost and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.070
 we have done a test and there was 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.860
 failed a way for three in this way 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.449
 protein is to stay with this how many 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.979
 parents commit your dogs and when the 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.419
 number of failures is equal to the number of 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.460
 appointments that you claim do not have the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.759
 repetitions and we finish 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.970
 and I do not expect anything that has served you because 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.970
 Help me 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.289
 and andres 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.910
