right here I know I can't beat them so
I'm<00:01:38.570> going<00:01:38.690> to<00:01:38.750> create<00:01:38.990> some<00:01:39.320> space<00:01:39.620> right

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
I'm going to create some space right

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.399 
I'm going to create some space right
here<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.610> look<00:01:41.150> for<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> secondary<00:01:41.840> play<00:01:42.170> if

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
here and look for a secondary play if

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.920 
here and look for a secondary play if
the<00:01:42.890> secondary<00:01:43.340> play<00:01:43.610> doesn't<00:01:43.970> work<00:01:44.150> you<00:01:44.780> can

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the secondary play doesn't work you can

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.050 
the secondary play doesn't work you can
also<00:01:45.080> get<00:01:45.350> your<00:01:45.470> feet<00:01:45.710> moving<00:01:45.880> now<00:01:46.880> that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
also get your feet moving now that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.880 
also get your feet moving now that
you've<00:01:47.180> created<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.690> space<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.860> can

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
you've created that space and you can

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.230

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.330 
look to get back to the middle of the
ice<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.320> other<00:01:51.470> option<00:01:51.560> would<00:01:52.070> look<00:01:52.190> like

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
ice so the other option would look like
