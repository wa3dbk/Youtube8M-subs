out in the day of racing nobody cared

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.750 
out in the day of racing nobody cared
and<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> chassis<00:02:24.200> was<00:02:24.500> always<00:02:25.129> scratched<00:02:25.459> up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.500 
then I'll put the goop around the
outside<00:05:32.690> or<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.230> urethane<00:05:34.130> now<00:05:34.910> there<00:05:35.270> goes

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
outside or the urethane now there goes

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.300 
outside or the urethane now there goes
around<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.960> outside<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.620> gets<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.950> finger

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
around the outside it gets the finger

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.430 
around the outside it gets the finger
the<00:05:37.880> wet<00:05:38.060> finger<00:05:38.510> treatment<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.110> make<00:05:39.260> it

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
the wet finger treatment to make it

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.220 
the wet finger treatment to make it
smooth<00:05:40.660> actually<00:05:41.660> I<00:05:41.720> was<00:05:41.810> putting<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.080> glue

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
smooth actually I was putting the glue

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.750 
smooth actually I was putting the glue
down<00:05:42.380> before<00:05:42.740> putting<00:05:42.980> it<00:05:43.160> now<00:05:43.340> we're<00:05:43.550> putting

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
down before putting it now we're putting

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.660 
down before putting it now we're putting
it<00:05:44.000> in<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.450> then<00:05:45.290> it'll<00:05:45.530> it'll<00:05:45.890> kick<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.490> so

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
it in and then it'll it'll kick and so

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.520 
it in and then it'll it'll kick and so
hot<00:05:46.940> that<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:47.630> really<00:05:47.900> don't<00:05:48.050> have<00:05:48.110> to<00:05:48.350> wait

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
hot that I really don't have to wait

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.100 
hot that I really don't have to wait
overnight<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.310> then<00:05:49.910> I'll<00:05:50.030> recoup<00:05:50.540> between

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
overnight and then I'll recoup between

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.200 
overnight and then I'll recoup between
the<00:05:51.290> tape<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:51.890> pull<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.400> tape<00:05:52.580> off<00:05:52.820> and

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
the tape and then pull the tape off and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.240 
the tape and then pull the tape off and
that<00:05:53.540> leaves<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.870> perfect<00:05:54.260> little<00:05:54.440> glue

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
that leaves the perfect little glue

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.460 
that leaves the perfect little glue
joint<00:05:55.610> now<00:05:56.510> of<00:05:56.600> course<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.900> remember<00:05:56.960> I<00:05:57.200> shut

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
joint now of course you remember I shut

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.080 
joint now of course you remember I shut
the<00:05:57.590> window<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:58.250> match<00:05:59.320> the<00:06:00.320> exact<00:06:01.090> edging

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
the window to match the exact edging

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.660 
the window to match the exact edging
around<00:06:02.300> it<00:06:02.870> so<00:06:03.140> it<00:06:03.380> of<00:06:03.770> course<00:06:04.040> looks<00:06:04.280> like<00:06:04.490> it

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
around it so it of course looks like it

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.880 
around it so it of course looks like it
