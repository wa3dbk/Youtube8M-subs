00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
doesn't have a very nice taste it has

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.900 
doesn't have a very nice taste it has
kind<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:50.590> unpleasant<00:03:51.590> watercress<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.820> know

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
kind of unpleasant watercress you know

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.190 
kind of unpleasant watercress you know
unpleasant<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.780> I'm<00:03:54.320> tasty<00:03:54.829> but<00:03:55.400> it<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.720> masks

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
unpleasant and I'm tasty but it it masks

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.789 
unpleasant and I'm tasty but it it masks
that<00:03:57.260> tastes<00:03:57.680> very<00:03:58.010> nicely<00:03:59.260> also<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.680> know

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799

beats<00:04:01.070> are<00:04:01.220> good<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.430> use<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.940> some<00:04:04.940> fruits<00:04:05.329> you

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
beats are good to use so some fruits you

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.509 
beats are good to use so some fruits you
should<00:04:05.690> not<00:04:05.810> juice<00:04:06.140> basically<00:04:06.920> generally

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
should not juice basically generally

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.420 
should not juice basically generally
speaking<00:04:07.640> soft<00:04:08.239> fruits<00:04:08.570> like<00:04:08.750> Kiwi<00:04:09.430> avocado

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
mode also bananas though they're great

those<00:04:20.540> three<00:04:20.750> things<00:04:20.959> are<00:04:21.110> great<00:04:21.350> for<00:04:21.650> like

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
those three things are great for like

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.030 
those three things are great for like
making<00:04:22.820> smoothies<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.600> shakes<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.770> forth

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
making smoothies and shakes and so forth

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.660 
making smoothies and shakes and so forth
but<00:04:25.190> they're<00:04:25.340> not<00:04:25.490> made<00:04:26.150> for<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:27.130> also<00:04:28.130> and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
but they're not made for this also and

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.400 
but they're not made for this also and
here<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:28.940> probably<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.510> biggest<00:04:29.750> tip<00:04:30.140> in

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
here is probably the biggest tip in

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.430 
here is probably the biggest tip in
terms<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.100> actual<00:04:31.510> preparation<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:33.140> so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
terms of the actual preparation and so

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.690 
terms of the actual preparation and so
forth<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:35.030> cannot<00:04:35.420> use<00:04:36.700> store-bought

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
forth is you cannot use store-bought

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.570 
forth is you cannot use store-bought
juice<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.660> was<00:04:38.810> pasteurized<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:40.190> can't<00:04:40.490> be

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
juice that was pasteurized it can't be

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.630 
juice that was pasteurized it can't be
store<00:04:40.970> bought<00:04:41.000> like<00:04:42.310> concentrated<00:04:43.310> where<00:04:43.490> you

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
store bought like concentrated where you

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.360 
store bought like concentrated where you
gives<00:04:44.420> you<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> nice<00:04:44.600> concentrated<00:04:45.440> tube<00:04:46.070> and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
gives you a nice concentrated tube and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.190 
gives you a nice concentrated tube and
you<00:04:46.490> pour<00:04:46.820> it<00:04:46.880> in<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.210> fill<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.750> with<00:04:47.780> water

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
you pour it in and fill it with water

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.810 
you pour it in and fill it with water
and<00:04:48.350> mix<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:48.950> doesn't<00:04:49.340> work<00:04:49.490> because<00:04:49.670> that

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
and mix that doesn't work because that

those the nutrients in that heaven

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.150 
those the nutrients in that heaven
pasteurized<00:04:53.600> they're<00:04:53.930> dead<00:04:54.200> so<00:04:54.860> they're<00:04:55.010> not

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
pasteurized they're dead so they're not

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.950 
pasteurized they're dead so they're not
I<00:04:55.520> mean<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.880> do<00:04:56.090> get<00:04:56.270> some<00:04:56.420> nutritional

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
for example that would not work because

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
messy if you don't prepare properly so

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.560 
messy if you don't prepare properly so
with<00:05:51.980> the<00:05:52.100> jack<00:05:52.340> lalanne<00:05:52.610> juicer<00:05:52.669> for<00:05:53.120> example

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
with the jack lalanne juicer for example

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.630 
with the jack lalanne juicer for example
the<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:54.200> dispeller<00:05:54.620> it<00:05:55.010> would<00:05:55.250> actually

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
the the dispeller it would actually

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.190 
the the dispeller it would actually
shoots<00:05:56.090> out<00:05:56.330> like<00:05:56.540> vegetable<00:05:56.990> or<00:05:57.050> fruit

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
shoots out like vegetable or fruit

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.070 
shoots out like vegetable or fruit
matter<00:05:57.530> in<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:58.220> can<00:05:58.250> kind<00:05:59.030> of<00:05:59.090> splash<00:05:59.630> over

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
matter in it you can kind of splash over

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.050 
matter in it you can kind of splash over
so<00:06:00.260> I<00:06:00.530> learned<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.250> by<00:06:01.460> putting<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.820> plastic

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
so I learned that by putting a plastic

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.450 
so I learned that by putting a plastic
bag<00:06:02.480> over<00:06:02.660> the<00:06:02.840> top<00:06:03.020> of<00:06:03.050> the<00:06:03.260> dispeller<00:06:03.590> within

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
bag over the top of the dispeller within

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.580 
bag over the top of the dispeller within
that<00:06:04.760> plastic<00:06:05.570> bag<00:06:05.750> which<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:05.990> within<00:06:06.260> the

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
that plastic bag which is within the

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.270 
that plastic bag which is within the
refuse<00:06:07.070> container<00:06:07.580> which<00:06:08.090> catches<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:09.280> the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
refuse container which catches the the

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.820 
refuse container which catches the the
juice<00:06:10.550> pope<00:06:11.060> or<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.360> fruit<00:06:12.260> or<00:06:12.410> vegetable

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
juice pope or the fruit or vegetable

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.420 
juice pope or the fruit or vegetable
pulp<00:06:13.040> that<00:06:14.410> prevents<00:06:15.410> it<00:06:15.530> from<00:06:15.590> spraying<00:06:16.010> also

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
pulp that prevents it from spraying also

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.920 
pulp that prevents it from spraying also
you<00:06:16.490> have<00:06:16.730> to<00:06:16.790> clean<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.120> up<00:06:17.330> after<00:06:17.660> every

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
you have to clean it up after every

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.050 
you have to clean it up after every
single<00:06:18.290> time<00:06:18.500> you<00:06:18.530> have<00:06:18.800> to<00:06:18.919> take<00:06:19.130> out<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.820> top

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
single time you have to take out the top

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.790 
single time you have to take out the top
and<00:06:20.330> then<00:06:20.419> scoop<00:06:20.810> out<00:06:20.960> the

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
and then scoop out the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.249 
and then scoop out the
juice<00:06:22.550> or<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.000> fruit<00:06:23.360> or<00:06:23.569> vegetable<00:06:24.080> matter
