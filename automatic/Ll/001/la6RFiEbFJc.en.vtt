 it comes complete its full load 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.029
 I recommend buying this one puts you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.220
 operators since if they buy in telecom 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 in the center or sanandrecitos surely 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.269
 they will be taken out or they will not sell him the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 basically the box 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.960
 a phone with a main camera 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.390
 5 megapixels with flash and made a team 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 with an 832-megapixel processor 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.290
 touch screen and a fat gorilla has 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.630
 protection with glass 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.300
 is quad band can connect with 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.670
 any operator has bluetooth wifi 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.010
 well let's go directly to the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.550
 known the content is here we are going to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.550
 be here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.160
 basically we find coats that 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.829
 we found is the phone 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.320
 well I hope with the new one it was 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.729
 your protector 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.030
 galaxy is android 632 megs phone 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.820
 fast ps with wifi and bluetooth like 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 assimilating what's inside the box 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.930
 we take this out let's have your problem 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.050
 currently comes with its manual manual 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 user I do not recommend reading the usual 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.660
 the manuals and in this case in this box 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.200
 comes with two homemade protectors 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.810
 long in its original black 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.590
 how are they found at the moment 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 comes with a s of a 2gb microsd 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.009
 with hands free so we arrived without things 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.289
 with the manual I came with its connector 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.990
 data to transfer suddenly file of 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.090
 music locations with the app les 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.039
 I recommend downloading only the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.060
 play store since any application 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.979
 that is not downloaded out there you can 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.979
 cause software problems to your 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.250
 phone and that does not cover the warranty and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's go here with the data connector 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.329
 we have here the wall charger in 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.209
 this case is from a 120 charger 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:21.500
 volts for Colombian and on the other 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.500
 microusb ends 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.160
 for the moment we carry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.420
 finally 8 the final 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.420
 this pile is a pile 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.010
 1350 million but now 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.260
 a very good stack for 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.200
 phone features basically 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.840

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.420
