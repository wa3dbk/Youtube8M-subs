to assemble a 95 corner base unit it is

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.850 
to assemble a 95 corner base unit it is
always<00:00:11.160> advisable<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:12.179> assembly<00:00:12.660> unit<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
always advisable to assembly unit on a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.589 
always advisable to assembly unit on a
piece<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.250> cardboard<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.059> protects<00:00:15.540> the

it drill it like this these brackets can

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.050 
it drill it like this these brackets can
be<00:03:19.540> fitted<00:03:19.750> flush<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.340> easier<00:03:21.760> for<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060
