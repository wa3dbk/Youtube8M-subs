00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.470

 boiled squids and to chicken farm 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.240
 crab sticks 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.880
 Bulgarian pepper onion greens for 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.250
 screen decorations and decorations from 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.949

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.940
 here we are not ready we take 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:41.449
 essential review we give them boiling water and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.670
 peel clean the boil Kanai 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.850
 to keep within as a change in principle 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.390
 boil water channels they surfaced with us 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.989
 ready to take out we surround 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.129
 this salad need to crumble them straws 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.589
 or our boiled squid carcasses 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.449
 cut into thin pocket 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.640
 will need depending on how much 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.580
 links are not preparing let's say on the ground 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.009
 four people we can take in raw 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.240
 the sight of Peter jokes once a mosquito 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.850
 from pharma as it will turn out 400 grams 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.950
 350 something like that we take our meat dishes 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.799
 shovels 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.329
 drop down to a salad is useful because in 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.429
 squids a lot of iodine 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.310
 and so here we constantly lack 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.670
 vitamin deficiency it will be helpful and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.100
 children and adults and do not recommend taking 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.759
 ready frozen peeled squids 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.500
 as they lose properties as a rule 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.560
 often in the shops we have wrong 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.869
 stored products defrost freezing 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.850
 that is, they lose their properties their 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.549
 useful qualities therefore easier to buy 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.610
 ordinariness rating Frozen 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.189
 what cook and bromine to squid 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.789
 we did not have fat on my 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.250
 it is noticeable that my darling is soft 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.569
 Looks like life if you overdo your pocket 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
 some did not boil 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.829
 and they have forgotten about them in the first place 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.940
 decrease in size and become 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.370
 tough so I rivers 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.300
 under cold water colander or sieve 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.520
 so that they cool down and then you can 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.010
 eat food 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.840

 I immediately salted squid so we 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.880
 crab sticks themselves have 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.070
 the egg seems to have its own taste too 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.960
