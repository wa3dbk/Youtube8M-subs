00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 and the rainbow cupcakes are a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.840
 burst of color that they will love to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.210
 the smallest to start we're going to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.910
 Mix 120 grams of butter to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.299
 room temperature with 200 grams of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.299
 sugar 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:31.200
 we incorporated 3 eggs we incorporated 200 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.400
 grams of flour and a teaspoon and 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.400
 yeast chemical media 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.170
 we incorporated 120 milliliters of milk and 2 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.170
 spoonfuls of hazelnuts in pasta 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.100
 the next step is to divide the mass into 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.320
 4 goals 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.600
 we need to do this to dye the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.830
 4 colors that will be the rainbow what 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.480
 you can do weighing the dough and 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.280
 dividing the but what I do is 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.410
 use a measuring spoon to throw 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.910
 always the same the same amount of 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.840
 mass in each of the goals 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.190
 we are going to use blue dye 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.190
 green red and yellow 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.860
 good 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.799
 We put the capsules in the mold to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.720
 that do not open during scratches 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.540
 Now we fill in a teaspoon 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.310
 of each color in each capsule you have to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.310
 Be careful never to go halfway 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.580
 and we bake 20 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.660
 now let's prepare a meringue 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.830
 Italian to decorate them in the first place 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.490
 We are going to mix 220 grams of sugar with 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.729
 115 ml of water 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.619
 and we are going to put it to heat 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.170
 we incorporate a spoonful and a half of syrup 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.820
 of corn while it warms up we're going to 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.939
 mount on snow stipple 4 clear 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.939
 egg 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.270
 when the egg whites are about to snow 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.270
 we beat again 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.410
 with a round mouthpiece 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.510
 and a few little hands of colors for 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.510
 eat them 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.610
 two
