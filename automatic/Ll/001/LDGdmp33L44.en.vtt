00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
 e 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.960
 we 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.969
 to draw momoko sakho the most 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.690
 known as marc au cochan 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.690
 started by making a vertical stroke 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.190
 separated in two marco is a 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.290
 chibi character it's a very style to 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.640
 fashion in mangas proportions 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.120
 they are completely different 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.260
 the head will always make half of the body 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.270
 the details will be as often 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.560
 attenuated on a chibi character one does not 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.800
 keep in general that the elements 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.070
 particularly distinctive characters 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.710
 on the bottom part we draw the dress 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.710
 legs and feet 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.030
 the size should be about 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.410
 center of the bottom part then the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 arm as you can see the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.250
 body proportions are rather normal 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.250
 only the head is bigger 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.269
 add the cost now it takes 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.030
 to make the face the proportions of the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.320
 face are also very different 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.320
 so put the horizontal line at 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.640
 first third of the bottom placed the ears 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.350
 at this level the design of the cup is 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.330
 very simple we must stop at 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.080
 level of the horizontal line and make 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.070
 spades all along his forehead 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.450
 also the characters followed are 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.049
 characterized by expressions 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.240
 caricature of their faces for that 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.770
 they rarely have a nose but always 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.350
 very big eyes and a mouth rather 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.789
 normal is in the eyes that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.600
 will be expressed most of 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.369
 Moroccan feelings is a little different 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.020
 because his eyes are only represented 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.409
 by two very simple black pupils 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.310
 like these we add two small 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.310
 circles for the cheeks 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.840
 then the folds of the dress in order to 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.229
 finalize the chalk sketch the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.229
 contours 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
 blacken eyes and hair 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.270
 at 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.500
 and you're done
