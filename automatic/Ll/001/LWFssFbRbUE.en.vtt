domestic cottages such as the one you
see<00:00:04.650> here<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.850> would<00:00:05.970> probably<00:00:06.509> like<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.109> have

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
see here you would probably like to have

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.320 
see here you would probably like to have
a<00:00:07.440> tool<00:00:07.770> which<00:00:08.309> would<00:00:08.519> allow<00:00:08.760> me<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.940> draw<00:00:09.269> the

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
a tool which would allow me to draw the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.680 
a tool which would allow me to draw the

dickhead offers you a multi-line

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.109 
dickhead offers you a multi-line
facility<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.779> picked<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.199> draw<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
facility so if we picked a draw and

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.960 
facility so if we picked a draw and
multi-line<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.539> I'll<00:00:28.410> started<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.580> make

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
multi-line and I'll started here make

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.359 
multi-line and I'll started here make
sure<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.390> authors<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.189> head

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
sure that authors on so that I can head

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
sure that authors on so that I can head
up<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.850> direction<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.809> I'm

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
up in this direction you can see I'm

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.209 
up in this direction you can see I'm
drawing<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.590> wall<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:37.230> step<00:00:37.500> so

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
drawing that wall in in one the step so

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
drawing that wall in in one the step so
let's<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.610> 4000<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.780> direction<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.829> will

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
let's go 4000 in that direction and will

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.630 
let's go 4000 in that direction and will
come<00:00:41.160> across<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.270> direction<00:00:42.480> maybe<00:00:43.640> 3000

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
come across in this direction maybe 3000

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
come across in this direction maybe 3000
so<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:45.329> easy<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.559> draw<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so you can see how easy it is to draw a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.959 
so you can see how easy it is to draw a
multi<00:00:48.149> line<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.600> use<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> multi<00:00:49.170> line<00:00:49.350> tool<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
multi line we use a multi line tool to

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
multi line we use a multi line tool to
draw<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> outer<00:00:51.300> wall<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.230> dwelling<00:00:52.590> if

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
draw the outer wall of the dwelling if

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.910 
draw the outer wall of the dwelling if
we<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.930> explode<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> assuming<00:00:55.590> we've<00:00:55.739> got

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we then explode that assuming we've got

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.410 
we then explode that assuming we've got
our<00:00:56.039> lengths<00:00:56.430> correct<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
our lengths correct and it's in the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.810 
our lengths correct and it's in the
correct<00:00:57.570> position<00:00:57.780> I'll<00:00:58.399> explode<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
correct position I'll explode it and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.520 
correct position I'll explode it and
that<00:00:59.940> breaks<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.480> into<00:01:00.660> individual

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that breaks it up into individual

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.820 
that breaks it up into individual
elements<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.640> there's<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
elements so you can see there's a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.050 
elements so you can see there's a
polyline<00:01:04.880> it's<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.090> quite<00:01:06.299> easy<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.280> copy<00:01:08.280> say

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
polyline it's in quite easy to copy say

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
polyline it's in quite easy to copy say
a<00:01:09.869> block<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:11.130> window<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.670> put<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> into

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
a block of a window and put it into

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.660 
a block of a window and put it into
position<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.260> could<00:01:13.409> copy<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:15.150> its

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
position so we could copy that from its

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.810 
position so we could copy that from its
insertion<00:01:17.670> point<00:01:17.909> or<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> midpoint<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
insertion point or the midpoint of the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.660 
insertion point or the midpoint of the
line<00:01:20.820> through<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.220> midpoints

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
line through here we want the midpoints

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
line through here we want the midpoints
not<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> work<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.540> us<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> grip<00:01:25.350> going

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
not going to work for us is a grip going

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
not going to work for us is a grip going
to<00:01:26.070> work<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.490> us<00:01:26.610> yes<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> grip<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to work for us yes a grip is going to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.740 
to work for us yes a grip is going to
work<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.590> us<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.340> we'll<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.670> from<00:01:30.360> there

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
work for us and now we'll go from there

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.200 
work for us and now we'll go from there
to<00:01:31.170> mid<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.390> we<00:01:33.390> should<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.659> able<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> line<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
to mid and we should be able to line the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
to mid and we should be able to line the
block<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.619> directly<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.860> top<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> wall<00:01:38.820> so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
block up directly on top of the wall so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
block up directly on top of the wall so
there<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.259> couple<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> clicks

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
there we are in a couple of clicks

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.100 
there we are in a couple of clicks
provided<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.909> have<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.180> block<00:01:42.420> library<00:01:42.899> set

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
provided you have your block library set

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
provided you have your block library set
up<00:01:43.229> properly<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> insertion<00:01:44.490> point<00:01:44.759> of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
up properly in the insertion point of

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
up properly in the insertion point of
the<00:01:45.000> blocks<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> correct<00:01:46.229> place<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:47.009> can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the blocks in the correct place you can

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
the blocks in the correct place you can
see<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.520> draw<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.390> outer<00:01:48.869> wall<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
see you can draw the outer wall of a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.870 
see you can draw the outer wall of a
dwelling<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.450> double-quick<00:01:51.450> time

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
dwelling like this in double-quick time

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
dwelling like this in double-quick time
so<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> multi-line<00:01:54.600> tool<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.710> useful

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
so the multi-line tool is very useful

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.179 
so the multi-line tool is very useful
tool<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.659> set<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:57.990> your<00:01:58.590> multi-line

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
tool you have to set up your multi-line

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.569 
tool you have to set up your multi-line
that's<00:01:59.700> done<00:01:59.969> via<00:02:00.270> settings<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.579> multi-line

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that's done via settings and multi-line

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.510 
that's done via settings and multi-line
before<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> start<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.899> I've<00:02:04.530> created<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.490> I

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
before you start and I've created when I

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.589 
before you start and I've created when I
called<00:02:06.469> 250<00:02:07.469> millimeter<00:02:08.160> double<00:02:09.000> wall<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
called 250 millimeter double wall and

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.600 
called 250 millimeter double wall and
you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.800> down<00:02:11.129> through<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.760> from<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
you can see down through here from the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.940 
you can see down through here from the
and<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.790> point<00:02:13.030> I've<00:02:13.150> offset<00:02:13.570> one<00:02:13.750> line<00:02:13.960> 125

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and to point I've offset one line 125

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.690 
and to point I've offset one line 125
mil<00:02:15.310> another<00:02:15.940> 15<00:02:16.480> another<00:02:17.260> -<00:02:17.770> 15<00:02:18.250> -<00:02:18.400> give<00:02:18.550> me

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
mil another 15 another - 15 - give me

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.260 
mil another 15 another - 15 - give me
the<00:02:18.880> gap<00:02:19.420> between<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.020> two<00:02:20.460> rows<00:02:21.460> of<00:02:21.760> bricks

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
the gap between the two rows of bricks

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.600 
the gap between the two rows of bricks
so<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.900> create<00:02:23.110> any<00:02:23.380> number<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.890> multi

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
so you can create any number of multi

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.090 
so you can create any number of multi
line<00:02:24.790> styles<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.780> give<00:02:25.810> them<00:02:26.200> meaningful

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
line styles and give them meaningful

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.340 
line styles and give them meaningful
names<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.670> use<00:02:27.940> them<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.300> your<00:02:28.360> drafting<00:02:28.990> so

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
names and use them in your drafting so

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.130 
names and use them in your drafting so
it's<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> very<00:02:29.680> useful<00:02:29.890> tool
