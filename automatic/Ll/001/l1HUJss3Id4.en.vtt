00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.150
 Lenka have a parrot if we are with you 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.030
 my parrot love well 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.210
 care about him follow all the same advice 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.769
 him a variety of food 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.240
 including not only grain mixture on and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.430
 vegetables fruit pap he flies a lot with us 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.660
 at least two to three hours a day 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 and even the whole day Talinka will 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.660
 pass unnoticed both for us and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 for our cover this is not a disease this 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.989
 natural process first time 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.460
 parrots change the average 3-4 months we 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 Now we speak in general of all parrots 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 1 such as him points of the classic 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.750
 black after shedding 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.110
 find adult males outfits 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 becomes bright yellow golovash black 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.280
 torso 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 and the inside of the tail and in vain 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.489
 Beenka and becomes one ton 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.430
 and the females just change the old feathers 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.770
 new colors at the same time I have something 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.979
 the same concerns beggar woman and others 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.950
 parrots they just minutes old 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.280
 lower 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.310
 first molt lasts several months 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 it is believed that the birds are the hardest as 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.670
 we can get our favorites we 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 should she feed better at this time we 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 must understand that he is more nervous 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.829
 than usual at this time give him 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.229
 mineral stone egg shell egg 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.460
 boiled 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 noticed that in the wild during 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.100
 molting they eat insects always 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.350
 next to it should be a swimmer in this 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:56.820
 period they love to swim when 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.950
 our little bird is already adult she is twice 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.930
 the year will also fade 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.310
 and this is lazy will last on average 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.990
 about a month from the practical side I 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.000
 I can say that he already holds 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.740
 parrot or several 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.860
 a little button but it will seem like it is 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.530
 generally occurs year round because 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.510
 anyway every day you will find 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.940
 some girls there are small 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.920
 big 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.530
 it's okay just some 3 of this 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.420
 battle of the strongest 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 but I repeat, if we, too, and the bird 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.810
 courted well will not be from those places 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.590
 and external does not like simplicity in the eyes of that 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.350
 your chip 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.940
 me and vice versa if something of this 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.250
 present and significantly 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.880
 doing something wrong need to be reconsidered 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:50.820
 feeding walking and so on and so 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:55.680
 similar there is also such a disease 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.020
 which is called the french line here 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.209
 So it looks in the photo I do not have 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.830
 something a button french she because 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.720
 first time or in France discovered and 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.209
 it affects those things 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.459
 who are just about to get out 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:19.530
 nests suddenly sheds tail feathers 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.840
 pretzels busy subside and by 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.970
 terrible 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.330
 many of them do not survive after this 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.269
 hospital and with 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.370
 such an observation that such cheeks 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.489
 hatch the same birds and which they planted 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.350
 the third time overlay for the year therefore still 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.780
 I repeat once again if you decide to spill 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.540
 parrot once a year with head 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.070
 you donâ€™t need enough 2 3 seating after all 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.290
 no good no good 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.310
 does not lead if in such chicks 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.060
 survive he no longer grow no more 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.190
 beautiful feathers are not tailing here 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.850
 here it remains as she see pictures 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.739
 and he can't fly he can someone 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.290
 such charcoal shoes 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.570
 and kept myself and don't even know why they 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.520
 fly why does he run and now you 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.780
 you know that most likely we did not survive 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.810
 french politics and another very 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.440
 often beginners get scared of this kind 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.050
 a budgie or a bag 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.110
 logic is something like you patron of 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.120
 which will be released new captive before 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.230
 how will she come this patron you 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.180
 carried the bird trusts can distinguish 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.800
 very gently teasing then with such 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.420
 white powder sprinkle 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.370
 and the feather will be easier to dissolve when 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.920
 birds in a pair or a lot of them with you 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.560
 each other so doing it is very nice 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.900
 but also one of the bird's favorite eyes they are 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.540
 they even put their heads up 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.440
 they kind of scratched them there passed them all 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.380
 these I call it shareholders should do 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.310
 All this is very important because if 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.050
 rudely hurt him will be here 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.100
 By the way you still answer the question very 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.160
 it is often asked to be as white as 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.170
 as if dandruff is white here is dandruff 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.490
 that is, this patron of of ace and guns 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.060
 as if we ourselves have considered everything 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.180
 remember that it is not a disease and all that 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.080
 it is necessary that our bird tolerated well 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.480
