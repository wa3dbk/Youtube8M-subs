00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.270
 david for the express x4 and we will 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.160
 Today Germany's most popular 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.530
 coffee makers or coffee makers 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 examine quotes and that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.450
 The senseo of philips should actually 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.869
 be a concept to everyone 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.789
 pet system i aspect comes in here 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.000
 For example, simply insert the sted 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.650
 make hitherto fall red lights 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.830
 the water is boiling and that's it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 coffee because that's nice to the senseo 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.600
 that they are relatively easy to handle 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 Especially in the rhine arch one is easy 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.960
 the patton the pet takes out the the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.120
 Going out of here can do it all 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.149
 I think I can cleanse even those 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 Dishwasher pack drop down here 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.129
 but finger has everything out wonderful 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.860
 some are very light this device too 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.750
 wait in contrast to big ones 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.750
 espresso machines or something like that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 no problem at all 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.840
 make tight and you 're ready to go 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.369
 here is the water tank with 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.470
 distance from minimum to maximum lost 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.280
 felt a bit something after that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:16.729
 Of course, here too filtered water 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:20.520
 so and then you just start 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 then the machine is called 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 just a cup third as we said 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.540
 take our team we have here once 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.909
 the original senseo patch for cappuccino 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.280
 So taken was a simultaneously 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.439
 test of the capo of senseo 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.360
 I'm still skeptical, I let myself 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.340
 you have to surprise that 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 It was a deep one to pick out two keys 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 pad is there is still a pad holder 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.750
 for just a taste or smaller petz 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.810
 but here for this petz must of the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.390
 take two cups of space as well as make 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 the water has preheated and I press 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.080
 just a button 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.100
 and I'm curious 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.350
 what is now just happens that the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.120
 once heated water through 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.800
 passes through and there the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.080
 Pulling out all the café and running it 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.460
 Stop right out and the cups rain man 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.200
 can also have two small buttons for 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.320
 nespresso imply that is not synonymous 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.320
 problem 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.430
 what i find in this machine is it 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.069
 is a machine for fast light weight 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.079
 café which one would like to offer someone 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.579
 but it is not a machine from the man 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.280
 in my opinion, right coffee 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.989
 So get time for the occasion 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.879
 coffee drinker wonderfully easy too 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.870
 handle very easy to clean 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.329
 you stand well 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.579
 For real coffee drinkers you have to 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.620
 think about the coffee 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.450
 wants to treat 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.549
 we have the cappuccino here now 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.129
 Of course no milk foam in 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.290
 The sense of how to load it 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.349
 get would be something like 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:57.069
 she expects but he looks quite ok 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:03:00.010
 and I have problems he tastes acceptable 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.870
 you can do that yes the philips 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.400
 senseo was very old machine easy too 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.810
 handle when you take it out now 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:15.010
 want 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:16.659
 easiest petting take out the pet 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.079
 Cleaner once cleaned would be better before 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.459
 the next use and that was already 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.549
 I recommend before the first use 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.440
 In any case urgently the machine 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.419
 go through a few times with water too 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.010
 let the last remnants of the 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.659
 to take out industrial production 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.010
 but then you should also easy 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.419
 can really use the use 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.799
 very simple there is a button for 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.329
 one key is a close two 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.419
 cups and another button that 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.430
 It was when the machine was made on 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.870
 that first needs a bit of that 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.909
 water something to heat 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.709
 if you need to heat it will flash 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.709
 red light when it is permanent 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.510
 lights up until it is operational 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.799
 the philips senseo if you like it 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.599
 if you have a good experience with it 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.829

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.109
