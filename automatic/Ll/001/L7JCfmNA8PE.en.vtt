00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.300 
um not too bad right
Gideon's<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.140> thought<00:02:37.319> these<00:02:37.440> two<00:02:37.680> figures<00:02:38.099> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
Gideon's I thought these two figures to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.979 
Gideon's I thought these two figures to
balance<00:02:38.730> each<00:02:38.879> other<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.450> lot<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.750> know

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
balance each other out a lot you know

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:53.210 
balance each other out a lot you know
like<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:52.319> that's<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.650> bridge<00:02:52.830> figure<00:02:53.099> by

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
like so that's the bridge figure by

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.440 
like so that's the bridge figure by
itself<00:02:53.519> cell<00:02:53.790> okay<00:02:54.060> maybe<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.390> little

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
itself cell okay maybe a little

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.750 
itself cell okay maybe a little
mid-range<00:02:55.140> nasal<00:02:55.560> sounding<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.129> I<00:02:56.340> thought

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
mid-range nasal sounding but I thought

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.850 
mid-range nasal sounding but I thought
when<00:02:57.239> they<00:02:57.299> put<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.569> two<00:02:57.720> together<00:02:57.810> then<00:02:58.739> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
when they put the two together then it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.440 
when they put the two together then it
would<00:02:58.950> sound<00:02:59.099> really<00:02:59.700> well-balanced<00:03:00.209> busy

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
would sound really well-balanced busy

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.330 
would sound really well-balanced busy
trying<00:03:00.870> y'all<00:03:01.049> oh<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.349> shit<00:03:01.620> here's<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.310> I

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
trying y'all oh that shit here's what I

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:17.470 
trying y'all oh that shit here's what I
got

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.869 

now<00:03:18.379> listen<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.800> what<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.129> difference<00:03:19.760> in

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
now listen to what the difference in

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:36.510 
now listen to what the difference in
volume<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.330> my<00:03:20.510> go<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.080> other<00:03:21.260> puppy<00:03:21.769> up

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.130 

point<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.640> when<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.210> put<00:03:38.420> in<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:38.690> pickup<00:03:38.930> I

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
point is when I put in this pickup I

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.470 
point is when I put in this pickup I
didn't<00:03:39.380> realize<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:40.280> was<00:03:40.520> out<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:41.120> phase

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
didn't realize that it was out of phase

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.970 
didn't realize that it was out of phase
and<00:03:44.080> there's<00:03:45.080> not<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.260> damn<00:03:45.440> thing<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.740> can<00:03:45.860> do

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
and there's not a damn thing you can do

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.770 
and there's not a damn thing you can do
about<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.220> because<00:03:46.520> this<00:03:46.910> metal<00:03:47.330> housing

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
about it because this metal housing

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.920 
about it because this metal housing
somehow<00:03:48.710> telling<00:03:49.100> about<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.930> automatically

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
somehow telling about it automatically

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.270 
somehow telling about it automatically
out<00:03:51.110> of<00:03:51.230> phase<00:03:51.380> with<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.710> neck<00:03:51.890> pickup<00:03:51.920> and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
out of phase with the neck pickup and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.260 
out of phase with the neck pickup and
there's<00:03:52.400> nothing<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.700> could<00:03:52.850> do<00:03:52.970> about<00:03:53.000> it

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
there's nothing you could do about it

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
there's nothing you could do about it
