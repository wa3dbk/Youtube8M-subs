00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.910 
way you can add other spices but really
I<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.630> salt<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.140> pepper<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.440> about<00:02:20.709> all<00:02:20.890> you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
I think salt and pepper is about all you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.199 
I think salt and pepper is about all you
need

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.759

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
okay now we're ready to stick it in the

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.030 
okay now we're ready to stick it in the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
trigger I stick it in on smoke for

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.890 
trigger I stick it in on smoke for
somewhere<00:02:37.030> between<00:02:37.090> 20<00:02:37.719> and<00:02:37.750> 40<00:02:38.140> minutes<00:02:41.340> and
