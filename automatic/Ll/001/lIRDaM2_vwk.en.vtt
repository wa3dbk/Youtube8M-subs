all over what I want to say shouldn't be

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.260 
all over what I want to say shouldn't be
or<00:00:59.640> should<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:01.579> makeup<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.850> makeup

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
or should be because makeup is makeup

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
or should be because makeup is makeup
and<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.780> whatever<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.559> it

and you can do whatever you want with it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.820 
and you can do whatever you want with it
but<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.610> me<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.390> an<00:01:06.960> all-over<00:01:07.260> powder

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but to me it's not an all-over powder

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.649 
but to me it's not an all-over powder
like<00:01:08.250> an<00:01:08.549> hourglass<00:01:08.970> ambient<00:01:09.210> lighting

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
like an hourglass ambient lighting

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.859 
like an hourglass ambient lighting
powder<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.229> example<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.729> too

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
powder for example they're just way too

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.050

shimmery<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.380> even<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.430> sheen<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
shimmery or even with this the sheen I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
shimmery or even with this the sheen I
think<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.869> gonna<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.350> bit<00:01:16.590> too

your<00:01:53.460> fingers<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.090> each<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.509> these<00:01:54.689> shades

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
your fingers in each of these shades

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.560 
your fingers in each of these shades
they<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:56.159> feel<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:56.549> nice<00:01:57.000> but

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
they actually feel pretty nice but

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870 
they actually feel pretty nice but
they're<00:01:57.750> powdery<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.829> problem<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> when

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
they're powdery is the problem and when

shimmery<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:51.830> would<00:02:52.130> say<00:02:52.280> like<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.640> sheen<00:02:53.030> type

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
shimmery I would say like a sheen type

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.590 
shimmery I would say like a sheen type
of<00:02:54.020> highlighter<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.040> very<00:02:55.250> very<00:02:55.490> nice<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.120> I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
of highlighter it's very very nice and I

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.240 
of highlighter it's very very nice and I
think<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:57.020> feels<00:02:57.200> really<00:02:57.410> buttery<00:02:57.800> on<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
think it feels really buttery on the

think it feels really buttery on the
skin<00:02:58.550> as<00:02:58.730> well<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.300> can<00:02:59.450> swirl<00:02:59.690> your<00:02:59.840> finger

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
skin as well you can swirl your finger

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.450 
skin as well you can swirl your finger
in<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.770> then<00:03:00.860> tap<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.100> on<00:03:01.280> your

in here and then tap it on your
cheekbone<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:01.910> buff<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.840> that's<00:03:03.350> how<00:03:03.560> I

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
cheekbone and buff it in that's how I

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.110 
cheekbone and buff it in that's how I
like<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:03.950> apply<00:03:04.130> highlighter<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.640> lot<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.910> times

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
like to apply highlighter a lot of times

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.040 
like to apply highlighter a lot of times
or<00:03:05.450> take<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> brush<00:03:06.710> and<00:03:07.090> slightly<00:03:08.090> go<00:03:08.420> over<00:03:08.780> the

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
or take a brush and slightly go over the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.750 
or take a brush and slightly go over the
tops<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.500> cheekbones<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.190> think<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.550> can

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
tops of your cheekbones I think you can

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.220 
tops of your cheekbones I think you can
use<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.360> many<00:03:11.630> different<00:03:11.780> ways

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
use this in many different ways

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.800 
use this in many different ways
just<00:03:12.890> not<00:03:13.100> as<00:03:13.340> an<00:03:13.490> all-over<00:03:13.700> powder<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.510> think

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
just not as an all-over powder I think

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.780 
just not as an all-over powder I think
it's<00:03:14.930> way<00:03:15.230> too<00:03:15.290> shimmery<00:03:16.250> for<00:03:16.490> that<00:03:16.610> the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
it's way too shimmery for that the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.580 
it's way too shimmery for that the
little<00:03:17.000> brush<00:03:17.210> fell<00:03:17.480> out<00:03:17.630> but<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.170> does<00:03:18.320> remind

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
little brush fell out but it does remind

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.650 
little brush fell out but it does remind
me<00:03:18.740> I<00:03:18.830> will<00:03:19.160> show<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.520> packaging<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.270> think

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
me I will show you the packaging I think

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.580 
me I will show you the packaging I think
it's<00:03:20.780> really<00:03:20.930> pretty<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:21.500> a

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
it's really pretty it's like a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.390 
it's really pretty it's like a
transparent<00:03:22.480> peachy<00:03:23.510> rosy<00:03:24.410> color<00:03:24.650> here<00:03:25.130> it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
transparent peachy rosy color here it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.580 
transparent peachy rosy color here it
comes<00:03:25.580> with<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.790> nice<00:03:26.060> big<00:03:26.300> mirror<00:03:26.570> here<00:03:27.050> with<00:03:27.560> a

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
comes with a nice big mirror here with a

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.530 
comes with a nice big mirror here with a
little<00:03:27.980> brush<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.550> I<00:03:28.580> wouldn't<00:03:29.150> really<00:03:29.420> use

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
little brush that I wouldn't really use

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.570 
little brush that I wouldn't really use
maybe<00:03:30.080> for<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:30.440> highlighter<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:30.980> can<00:03:31.190> use<00:03:31.430> it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
maybe for a highlighter you can use it

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.880 
maybe for a highlighter you can use it
like<00:03:31.670> right<00:03:31.910> on<00:03:31.940> your<00:03:32.120> cheekbone<00:03:32.570> but<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:33.170> don't

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
like right on your cheekbone but I don't

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.800 
like right on your cheekbone but I don't
know<00:03:33.950> it's<00:03:34.250> there<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.610> want<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:35.000> overall<00:03:35.780> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
know it's there if you want it overall I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.520 
know it's there if you want it overall I
think<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.320> packaging<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:37.040> really<00:03:37.730> pretty<00:03:37.940> and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
think the packaging is really pretty and
