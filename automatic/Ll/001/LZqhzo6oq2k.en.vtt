 White chocolate was starved to death was in pale green 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.350
 Princesses who are here today do not use the candy bell 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.879
 Was the lighter colored white chocolate became a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.739
 I used the things of the gel or such Jo rather than the coloring of liquid 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.739
 Please see the description for details 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.559
 Scotch tape 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 The paper on which you printed the princesses This is the one I found online so in the circle description box 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.180

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.750
 Please give me 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.240
 All you need is the upper body 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.240
 Make a girls skirt cake pop 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:39.220
 Gold and silver edible glitter to decorate your skirt with glitter 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.220
 Please are available in the water with and 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.290
 Let's get started 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.290
 Here are two cake pops of different sizes 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.960
 This is a golf ball size normal size, but a slightly larger one than that this time 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.850
 Use 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:14.390
 It is to finish the princess's skirt into a more plump and long dress 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.760
 Arrange a large cake pop into a round ball shape 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.450
 Next it is in the form of ice cream cone 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.989
 I make a corn Tongari like pinching in the palm 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.989
 If it is shaped, it will be chilled in related warehouse for 15 minutes 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.500
 By doing so, you can prevent the loss of shape when disaster prevention of lollipops 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.020
 Here is what I prepared in advance: 15 minutes cooled and then melted white 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.600
 Stab the lollipop stick wearing a chocolate 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.600
 Chilled in refrigerator for 5 minutes to harden 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.380
 Let's put chocolate on this, and here is this size of cooking 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.040
 I need a paper 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.290
 Dry the cake pop with chocolate on it 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.319
 Because I want to put on a princess soon after coating chocolate 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.319
 I put cellophane tape on the back of the princess now 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:33.030
 If you put it on your back, get the rest down to the other side and put it on the mat 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.030
 This way you can use it immediately when you need it 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.230
 Soak cake pops in chocolate in a deep container 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.170
 With a chocolate so as to be hidden completely to the joint of the cake pop and board tilted a little 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.170
 I will 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:17.780
 When the whole is covered with chocolate put on cooking paper 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.780
 You dress in doing so is ready to have hit the floor 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.840
 Here tee Ana stuck to just mat 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.840
 And secure it to the rod of the lollipop 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.260
 The chocolate stings even on Teana's chocolate before it dries completely 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.210
 Prevent her body from slipping 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.620
 This is how the princesses did it too 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.540
 Back of the book firmly paste the rest of the cellophane tape after completion 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.820
 Please cut out 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.820
 Let's leave until dry at this point 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.490
 I think good to write pattern to skirt such as professional Sting and chocolate 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:26.070
 As I said earlier, you can decorate it with glitter 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:32.220
 The edible glitter should be in the shop dealing with cake decorations 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:33.249
 With a little water after frame the cake pop is completely dry If you want to give the glitter 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.439
 I will 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.439
 Let's be careful not to put too many 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:45.820
 In cute and finger take the extra moisture while Why finger glitter Wotsu only 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:50.950
 We sprinkle from a little high position 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:54.490
 In Why state chocolate is chocolate and say whether to after the dry is still melted 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.980
 Even with the glitter will sinks into the chocolate 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:03.050
 Not noticeable 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:03.050
 This is the most cost-effective because glitter is not cheap . 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.990
 This is the end of the glitter press 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.630
 Colorful and cute princesses are ready 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.340
 If you make a hole in a cute tag with a name and put it on a lollipop stick 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.050
 Transformed into a seat bill 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.050
 It will also be a souvenir for the party 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:37.920
 The paper on which the princess is printed this time is not ordinary and is a glossy type of photo paper 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.210
 Please use thicker and harder hair than plain paper 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.360
