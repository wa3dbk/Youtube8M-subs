 we are ready to go again 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.310
 people who are watching and I 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.020
 know that you are sending your questions 100 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.250
 takes a lot of dollarama amplifies 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.750
 but I try to answer all the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.599
 world knows if you do not find your 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 question about the channel the y string 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.900
 sit still aids 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.859
 it will take time but I will 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.290
 answer because there are a lot of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.110
 job as I said it's that beautiful 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 I hope you are well 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.829
 in this I just wanted to tell you 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 something that's been going a lot of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.309
 genres can you make a video for 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
 show our Algerian friends who believe 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.200
 that take mass and musk goes 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 make them less flexible because there is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.500
 many people even aces but 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.559
 especially footballers who tell me 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.160
 not to come but we littrell 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.930
 young and I settled but what courage 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 I did not have to go beat the question to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:12.630
 to say y'a audiard delegated football 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.030
 rap lover anyway there because 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 led a footballer to take 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 muscle mass and lead 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.500
 someone to take the mass 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.640
 muscle using the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 bodybuilding it's completely different 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.890
 that's because footballers turn 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
 athletes any athlete who want to be 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.799
 explosive on board muscle mass 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.990
 he has to do a training 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.140
 functional ie it's a mix of 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.939
 body body training 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.009
 workouts at all of the whole body 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.040
 at the same time make movements 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.500
 explosives of which there is a protocol to 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.399
 to follow when you train an athlete 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.750
 also guys from two who make one of 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.759
 martial arts it's the same thing from 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 judokas the same thing the boxers the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.259
 same thing they can not go to the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.000
 gym and just do some exercises 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.259
 bodybuilding like crops and on the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 legion by bodybuilding no they 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.100
 can not do that he has to bump 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.619
 who moves quickly he has to make 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.840
 a training system that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.050
 constituted constituted of more 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.340
 your exercise in circuit by taking a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.840
 rest time between each circuit but 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.760
 because they spend for all 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 a lot of calories from when 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.230
 so train these people he has to he 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.810
 trains differently m 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.879
 so if you read like you 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.510
 coach someone who does 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.849
 bodybuilding 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.920
 yes they will lose flexibility 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.530
 why because it's a movement 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.989
 also yielded uses static drive 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.819
 most tallet the bodybuilders who 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.630
 are not short it's very very rare 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.950
 where you find bodybuilders who are 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.250
 very flexible 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.190
 I had to work my 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.480
 flexibility a lot a lot in my 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.900
 career as a culture is 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.129
 professional to be able to improve myself 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.870
 in muscle growth 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.910
 that's the problem of all 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.260
 bodybuilders if bodybuilders flap on 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.920
 their flexibility they will be even more 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.000
 big I give you the typical tom example 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.129
 complaint 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.579
 people who sticks it was in the 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.139
 80 72 80 it was huge 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.480
 your legs momentum so far a 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.120
 no one has the temple legends at 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.910
 it was super opens so you have to do 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.530
 adp of flexibility 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.299
