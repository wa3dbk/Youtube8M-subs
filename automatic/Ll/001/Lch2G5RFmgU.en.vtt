cha-cha pointers American cha-cha we're
going<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.740> side<00:00:52.980> basic<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
going to do the side basic and this is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.680 
going to do the side basic and this is
for<00:00:54.630> practice<00:00:55.290> or<00:00:55.470> training<00:00:56.040> no<00:00:56.670> rotation<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
for practice or training no rotation so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.670 
for practice or training no rotation so
sidestep<00:00:58.320> no<00:00:59.100> rotation<00:00:59.760> on<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.000> rock<00:01:00.180> step

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
sidestep no rotation on the rock step

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.950

cha<00:01:01.680> cha<00:01:01.740> step<00:01:02.520> again<00:01:02.880> no<00:01:03.090> rotation<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.810> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
cha cha step again no rotation on the

cha cha step again no rotation on the
rock<00:01:04.140> step<00:01:05.540> you<00:01:06.540> could<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> routine

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
rock step you could do this in a routine

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.720 
rock step you could do this in a routine
generally<00:01:09.120> I<00:01:09.150> prefer<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.900> turn<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.440> basic<00:01:10.890> so

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
generally I prefer to turn the basic so

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.670 
generally I prefer to turn the basic so
when<00:01:11.910> we<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> rock<00:01:12.600> step<00:01:13.050> I<00:01:14.300> rotate<00:01:15.680> cha

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
when we do the rock step I rotate cha

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.350 
when we do the rock step I rotate cha
cha<00:01:17.040> step<00:01:17.600> rotate<00:01:18.600> straight<00:01:20.510> rotate<00:01:21.590> straight

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
cha step rotate straight rotate straight

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
cha step rotate straight rotate straight
rotate<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.260> could<00:01:25.410> ask<00:01:25.530> Miss<00:01:25.740> Erica<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> stay

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
rotate if I could ask Miss Erica to stay

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
rotate if I could ask Miss Erica to stay
right<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.050> doing<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
right there so what I'm doing for the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.020 
right there so what I'm doing for the
rotation<00:01:29.190> I'm<00:01:29.640> doing<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> back<00:01:30.360> rock<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:32.030> can

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
rotation I'm doing the back rock I can

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.820 
rotation I'm doing the back rock I can
bring<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> lady<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.050> me<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
bring the lady in to me I'm going to

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:48.460 
bring the lady in to me I'm going to
pigeon<00:01:35.250> toe<00:01:44.780> big<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.740> lady's<00:01:47.100> doing<00:01:47.400> the

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
pigeon toe big the lady's doing the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.880 
pigeon toe big the lady's doing the
opposite<00:01:49.470> foot<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.869> rotate<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.590> here's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
opposite foot so if I rotate this here's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.940 
opposite foot so if I rotate this here's
my<00:01:53.039> sidestep<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:55.080> both<00:01:55.259> turning<00:01:55.800> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
my sidestep so we're both turning the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.389 
my sidestep so we're both turning the
feet

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
feet

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.249 
feet
we're<00:01:56.580> both<00:01:56.729> rotating<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.509> left<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.050> she's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
we're both rotating to the left so she's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.930 
we're both rotating to the left so she's
gonna<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.590> duck<00:01:58.830> foot<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:01:59.220> gonna<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.550> pigeon

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
gonna go duck foot I'm gonna go pigeon

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.940 
gonna go duck foot I'm gonna go pigeon
toe<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.750> twisting<00:02:01.320> action<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.830> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
toe so we have a twisting action in the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.690 
toe so we have a twisting action in the
feet<00:02:02.160> both<00:02:02.429> times<00:02:02.789> cha<00:02:03.539> cha<00:02:03.750> step<00:02:04.520> we're<00:02:05.520> both

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
feet both times cha cha step we're both

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.109 
feet both times cha cha step we're both
turning<00:02:06.119> our<00:02:06.240> feet<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.630> left

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
turning our feet to the left

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.870 
turning our feet to the left
cha<00:02:09.119> cha<00:02:09.360> step<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> don't<00:02:11.190> turn<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.700> base

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
cha cha step if you don't turn the base

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.000 
cha cha step if you don't turn the base
if<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.300> try<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> turn<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.290> body<00:02:13.440> without

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
if you try to turn the body without

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.160 
if you try to turn the body without
turning<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> turning<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> base<00:02:15.630> letting<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
turning the turning the base letting the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.570 
turning the turning the base letting the
feet<00:02:16.350> swivel<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.010> won't<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.460> much

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
feet swivel you won't have as much

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.910 
feet swivel you won't have as much
success
