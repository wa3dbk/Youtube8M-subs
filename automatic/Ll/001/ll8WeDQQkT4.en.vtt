and<00:00:00.890> here<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.040> time<00:00:02.610> for<00:00:02.909> another<00:00:03.230> quadcopter

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
and here is time for another quadcopter

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.460 
and here is time for another quadcopter
project<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.730> at<00:00:05.940> our<00:00:06.089> university<00:00:07.080> here

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
project this is at our university here

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.650 
project this is at our university here
in<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.950> beacon<00:00:08.849> lap<00:00:09.679> beginners<00:00:10.679> these<00:00:11.660> 3d

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
in the beacon lap beginners these 3d

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.330 
in the beacon lap beginners these 3d
tracking<00:00:13.080> cameras<00:00:13.740> all<00:00:14.130> around<00:00:15.859> so<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.160> are

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
tracking cameras all around so we are

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.910 
tracking cameras all around so we are
able<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:19.010> very<00:00:20.010> precisely<00:00:20.580> track<00:00:21.300> our

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
able to very precisely track our

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:30.939 
able to very precisely track our
quadcopter<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.150> we<00:00:24.150> mounted<00:00:24.869> these<00:00:26.150> infrared

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.540 

beacon<00:00:31.949> balls<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.669> will<00:00:33.079> re-emit<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
beacon balls that will re-emit and

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
beacon balls that will re-emit and
reflect<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.969> ire<00:00:36.300> lights

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
reflect the ire lights

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.520 
reflect the ire lights
so<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.430> our<00:00:38.579> quadcopter<00:00:39.530> construction

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
so this is our quadcopter construction

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090 
so this is our quadcopter construction
which<00:00:41.370> currently<00:00:42.210> only<00:00:42.390> contains<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.260> tape<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
which currently only contains a tape a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600 
which currently only contains a tape a
multi<00:00:44.640> cup<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> board<00:00:45.350> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.489> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
multi cup the board which is just a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.779 
multi cup the board which is just a
gyroscope<00:00:48.079> board<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.309> Bluetooth

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
gyroscope board and then a Bluetooth

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.819 
gyroscope board and then a Bluetooth
module<00:00:50.969> together<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.750> an<00:00:51.899> Arduino<00:00:52.260> just

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
module together with an Arduino just

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.130 
module together with an Arduino just
running<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:53.399> parsing<00:00:54.120> algorithm<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.800> can

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
running some parsing algorithm so we can

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
running some parsing algorithm so we can
control<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.559> input<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> ke<00:01:00.059> ke

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
control the input to the ke ke

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.139 
control the input to the ke ke

multicopter with the pc through
bluetooth<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.549> we've<00:01:05.549> managed<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
bluetooth and we've managed to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960 
bluetooth and we've managed to
successfully<00:01:06.570> get<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.350> quadcopter<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
successfully get this quadcopter up and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that keeps the the rotation speed stable

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.370 
that keeps the the rotation speed stable
to<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> specific<00:01:19.860> input<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.850> use<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> angle

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to a specific input we use the angle

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
to a specific input we use the angle
measurements<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.430> precision

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
measurements from the beacon system to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.440 
measurements from the beacon system to
keep<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> quadcopter<00:01:28.259> balances<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.450> staple

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
keep the quadcopter balances and staple

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.319 
keep the quadcopter balances and staple
at<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.810> put<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> specific<00:01:31.439> position<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
at I put a specific position here in the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.600 
at I put a specific position here in the
room<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.290> let's<00:01:34.320> try<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.759> give<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.420> fly

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
room so let's try and and give it a fly

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.090 
room so let's try and and give it a fly
here<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> PD<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.110> MATLAB

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
here at the PD we make this MATLAB

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.179 
here at the PD we make this MATLAB
script<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:42.570> takes<00:01:42.930> care<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
script which takes care of all the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.080 
script which takes care of all the
Viking<00:01:45.229> camera<00:01:46.229> readings<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.090> stabilization

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
Viking camera readings and stabilization

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
Viking camera readings and stabilization
we<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> couple<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.380> different<00:01:49.860> PID

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
we have a couple of different PID

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.039 
we have a couple of different PID
algorithms<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.090> let's<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.659> start

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
algorithms in here so now let's so start

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:05.389 
algorithms in here so now let's so start
this<00:01:55.200> program<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:56.460> how<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.820> works

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.990 

and<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.880> quadcopter<00:02:07.119> hovers

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and the quadcopter hovers

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.050 
and the quadcopter hovers
and<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> PC

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.130 

we<00:02:13.569> can<00:02:13.780> see<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.340> current<00:02:15.340> position<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.150> we

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
we can see the current position and we

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.520 
we can see the current position and we
have<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.670> control<00:02:18.670> port<00:02:19.240> here<00:02:19.569> where<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.319> can

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
have a control port here where we can

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.270 
have a control port here where we can
set<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.890> height<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> now<00:02:23.110> let's<00:02:23.380> try<00:02:23.560> try<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
set the height so now let's try try and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.350 
set the height so now let's try try and
raise<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.700> height<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.530> 110<00:02:26.530> centimeters

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.650 

there<00:02:34.020> we<00:02:34.140> go

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.490 

and<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.460> also<00:02:39.610> move<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.600> quadcopter

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
and we can also move the quadcopter

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.440 
and we can also move the quadcopter
around<00:02:42.430> with<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.390> different<00:02:43.720> buttons

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.440 

which<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.260> reflective<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.910> graph<00:02:52.150> where

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
which is reflective on the graph where

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.170 
which is reflective on the graph where
the<00:02:52.480> blue<00:02:52.780> dots<00:02:53.050> indicate<00:02:53.560> our<00:02:54.180> desired

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the blue dots indicate our desired

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.180 
the blue dots indicate our desired
position<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.989> reps<00:02:56.200> indicate<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
position and the reps indicate the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:24.080 
position and the reps indicate the
current<00:02:57.400> quadcopter<00:02:58.000> position

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.030 

and<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.750> quad-carbon<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.319> also<00:03:25.560> relatively

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
and the quad-carbon is also relatively

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.690 
and the quad-carbon is also relatively
stable<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.700> we<00:03:26.849> need<00:03:27.000> walk<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.360> here<00:03:27.739> we<00:03:28.739> can

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.460 

to<00:03:32.270> a<00:03:32.300> small<00:03:32.690> movement

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.630 

and<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:37.220> will<00:03:37.400> come<00:03:37.790> back

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.730 

so<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.180> celibate<00:03:46.170> project<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:46.770> far<00:03:47.090> let's<00:03:48.090> say

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740
