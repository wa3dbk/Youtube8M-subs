00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.560 

the<00:00:56.579> mark<00:00:56.850> text<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> threads<00:00:59.570> berenices

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the mark text and the threads berenices

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
the mark text and the threads berenices
it's<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.200> grant<00:01:01.470> English

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.090 

so<00:01:06.460> if<00:01:06.610> I<00:01:06.790> know<00:01:07.000> sometimes

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.649 

look<00:01:12.700> not<00:01:12.909> everyone<00:01:13.979> knows<00:01:14.979> better<00:01:15.600> okay

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.639 

let's<00:01:18.960> check<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:21.479> shows<00:01:21.749> Emma<00:01:22.079> cereals

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
let's check it it shows Emma cereals

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:29.889 
let's check it it shows Emma cereals
that<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.369> sure<00:01:23.700> we're<00:01:24.119> gonna<00:01:24.420> start

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.709 

much<00:01:30.899> no<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.890> nothing<00:01:32.219> slow<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.959> it

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
much no it's nothing slow or is it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.490 
much no it's nothing slow or is it
permanent

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 

so<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.920> manually<00:01:42.280> compare

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so you have to manually compare

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:53.550 
so you have to manually compare
oscilloscope<00:01:43.930> down<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:45.930> Reynolds<00:01:47.100> kids<00:01:48.100> down

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:04.510 

ok

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.940 

the<00:02:04.969> world<00:02:05.180> doesn't<00:02:05.359> knows<00:02:05.630> what<00:02:05.899> this<00:02:06.079> means

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.199 

but<00:02:09.550> honestly<00:02:09.970> this<00:02:10.360> has<00:02:10.750> some<00:02:11.730> milk<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.090> some

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
but honestly this has some milk and some

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:22.900 
but honestly this has some milk and some
brush<00:02:13.599> hotel

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:32.660 

miss<00:02:23.910> Oliver

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.080 

so<00:02:50.700> what<00:02:52.069> probably<00:02:53.069> means<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.659> one<00:02:56.090> I'm
