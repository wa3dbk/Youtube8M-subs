you want to know the ink levels well

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.140 
you want to know the ink levels well
let's<00:00:33.410> say<00:00:33.560> you're<00:00:33.710> doing<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:34.100> long<00:00:34.370> run<00:00:34.700> on<00:00:35.030> the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150

let's say you're doing a long run on the
job<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:36.110> really<00:00:36.470> want<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.770> know<00:00:36.829> how<00:00:37.070> much

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
job and you really want to know how much

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.970 
job and you really want to know how much
it's<00:00:37.610> costing<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.420> well<00:00:39.050> by<00:00:39.380> doing<00:00:39.440> this

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
it's costing you well by doing this

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.550 
it's costing you well by doing this
before<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.610> start<00:00:40.910> your<00:00:41.090> job<00:00:41.300> run<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:42.380> can

before you start your job run you can
determine<00:00:42.829> your<00:00:43.040> exact<00:00:43.550> ink<00:00:43.850> levels<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.450> so

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
determine your exact ink levels and so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.810 
determine your exact ink levels and so
the<00:00:44.810> two<00:00:44.989> bits<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.380> information<00:00:45.530> I<00:00:46.310> like<00:00:46.579> to

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
the two bits of information I like to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.880 
the two bits of information I like to
know<00:00:47.000> when<00:00:47.630> I'm<00:00:47.750> going<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:47.930> do<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.110> long<00:00:48.380> run<00:00:48.649> is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
know when I'm going to do a long run is

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.150 
know when I'm going to do a long run is
what's<00:00:49.880> my<00:00:50.060> page<00:00:50.300> count<00:00:50.660> once<00:00:51.380> my<00:00:51.590> ink<00:00:51.770> level

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
what's my page count once my ink level

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.430 
what's my page count once my ink level
the<00:00:52.550> page<00:00:52.730> count<00:00:53.000> can<00:00:53.390> be<00:00:53.540> found<00:00:53.899> by<00:00:54.170> just

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
the page count can be found by just

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.590 
the page count can be found by just
simply<00:00:54.829> pushing<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.250> Menu<00:00:55.460> key<00:00:55.640> down<00:00:56.329> arrow

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
simply pushing the Menu key down arrow

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.170 
simply pushing the Menu key down arrow
key<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:56.960> list<00:00:57.320> test<00:00:57.710> pushing<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:58.790> enter<00:00:58.969> key

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
key to list test pushing the enter key

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.750 
key to list test pushing the enter key
twice<00:00:59.450> and<00:01:00.230> on<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:00.590> piece<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:00.980> paper<00:01:01.130> it'll

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
twice and on that piece of paper it'll

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.729 
twice and on that piece of paper it'll
give<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.090> your<00:01:02.270> page<00:01:02.480> count<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.320> let's<00:01:03.559> get

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
give you your page count so let's get

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.010 
give you your page count so let's get
started<00:01:04.250> with<00:01:04.580> determining<00:01:05.420> what<00:01:05.690> our<00:01:05.810> ink

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
started with determining what our ink

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.160 
started with determining what our ink
levels<00:01:06.470> really<00:01:06.890> are<00:01:07.040> okay<00:01:08.000> if<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:08.750> look<00:01:08.870> at<00:01:09.049> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
levels really are okay if we look at the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.980 
levels really are okay if we look at the
display<00:01:09.620> now<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:10.370> see<00:01:10.850> some<00:01:11.090> bars<00:01:11.330> that<00:01:11.720> really

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
display now we see some bars that really

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.750 
display now we see some bars that really
don't<00:01:12.200> give<00:01:12.409> us<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.680> whole<00:01:12.860> lot<00:01:13.010> of<00:01:13.040> information

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
don't give us a whole lot of information

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.210 
don't give us a whole lot of information
of<00:01:13.940> what<00:01:14.090> our<00:01:14.210> true<00:01:14.510> ink<00:01:14.720> levels<00:01:15.110> are<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.680> so

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
of what our true ink levels are and so

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.010 
of what our true ink levels are and so
what<00:01:16.430> we<00:01:16.549> can<00:01:16.700> do<00:01:16.850> is<00:01:17.060> take<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.450> printer<00:01:17.750> into

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
what we can do is take the printer into

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.920 
what we can do is take the printer into
the<00:01:18.140> service<00:01:18.590> mode<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.159> ask<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.119> exactly<00:01:20.659> what

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
the service mode and ask it exactly what

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.080 
the service mode and ask it exactly what
the<00:01:21.110> ink<00:01:21.290> levels<00:01:21.710> are<00:01:21.860> now<00:01:22.460> again<00:01:22.850> let<00:01:23.060> me

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
the ink levels are now again let me

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.719 
the ink levels are now again let me

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
our ink levels are and therefore we can

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.039 
our ink levels are and therefore we can
keep<00:03:22.400> up<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.910> how<00:03:23.329> much<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.690> printer<00:03:23.989> is
