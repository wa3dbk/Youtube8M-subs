00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.579
 correctly then the first step of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.289

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.940
 sebum and matifies the skin so that's 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.390

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.950

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.729
 small imperfections 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.860
 for my morning routine for fight 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.140
 to tell me about blemishes and acne 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.670
 I use this lotion that comes from 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.030
 chaos mazzone always so I you 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.829

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.259
 firstly his smell is pretty 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.369
 particular but detoxify 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.899
 tone the skin 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.390
 and if you really have 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.770
 imperfections I advise you 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.329
 a lot I think my skin is 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.369
 really better since 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.399
 I use this lotion have to finally 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.049
 finish with my morning care routine I 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.909
 come use this jelly from home 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.530
 garnish so as they say it does 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.030
 really a tonic awakening because 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 it's a very fresh jelly 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.720
 her smell is super nice she 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.429
 penetrates very quickly into the skin and she 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.849
 just give a pose appearance of 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.970
 test 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.590
 if you have tired skin term this is 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.660
 really the product that you do not need 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.840
 sure I think it's all 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.840
 the difference 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 but for the mornings I do not make up 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.020
 I do not prefer to use aloe gel 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.090
 vera that comes to repair my skin what I 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.370
 do a lot of eczema and suddenly 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.680
 but really not bad I was not going 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.720
 on the other hand not when I make up 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.090
 since his federation cleaves luche and therefore 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.230
 it's a bit annoying but I really 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.850
 advise you anyway aloe vera 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 who is really coming to fix your skin 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.250
 it's now my evening routine so 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.620
 when I'm wearing makeup I come from the mac 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.640
 and my eyes with this makeup remover gel 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.480
 at barbara gould 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.159
 it's great because it does not sting it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.900
 maquis really good makeup 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.849
 waterproof so I recommend it 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.280
 really so far so you have not 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.560
 not found any makeup remover that you 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.540
 was suitable for then mac and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.620
 the whole of my face I use this 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.260
 garnier gel 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.939
 I also use in passing the mask of 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.769
 that same range of people no longer had 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.459
 so I could not introduce you 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.019
 but this freeze debate which is really good 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.350
 he is not at all aggressive so I 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.450
 really advise you 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.730
 and to finish with one of the make-ups 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.550
 perfect I use this so this lotion 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.430
 with lemon water of shia roma zone which 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.740
 come on let 's say detoxify again a 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.600
 once and matifie I find since as soon 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.880
 we use we have the skin that appears 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.910
 everything was and that does not shine 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.010
 everything is not aggressive at all 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.210
 line smell very nice and I you 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.210
 really thought this lotion 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.190
 now really about care 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.530
 targeted acne I use for small 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.420
 pimples this chestnut cream 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.230
 boukhrief nehal who is really 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.450
 effective 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.790
 it does not stop the skin so much 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.250
 have to go back two or three times to 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.550
 that really it works well but 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.590
 I find this cream really useful and 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.780
 for the inflammed button elk we do not 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.580
 do not know why they are there I use 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.770
 the relic should not, however, 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.530
 used twice in a row because it burns 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.210
 the skin shot so effective in the lead 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.160
 and so we really have to apply it that 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.450
 on the button and I guarantee that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.550

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.320
 completely different appearance but 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.000
 with all its care, it is necessary to feed well 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.820
