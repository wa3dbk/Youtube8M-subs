 [Music] 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:16.080
 it's 10 in the morning I was going to go to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.920
 record the first video of the season 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.920
 of the field 15 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.279
 we will start making these games xvi for 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.810
 let me see what's hiding behind 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:32.250
 organizing a video joke and 4 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.690
 minutes the video is samsung product here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 if the storyboard storyboard is obviously 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.340
 the culture of the scenes that indicates one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.640
 sort of script is called used 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.750
 shots shooting 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.770
 then a script that you carry with you 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.320
 [Music] 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.980
 this seems to us with the hostages because of them 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.900
 people first of all commit themselves 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.070
 very late compared to the agreed times 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.660
 and therefore they piss off present see 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:16.810
 the shit that they don't want 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:18.940
 move from the bed they say and I have to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.630
 do not need to get gas 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:26.160
 I did not hear immediately we have behind 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.300

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.660

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.950
 we're leaving that wear those things 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.360
 there is also the darkness of Rome on the outside 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:56.470
 let's do what you need to do 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.069
 brightness that falls and becomes friend but 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.950
 after the football and the nasa code stands 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:12.220
 recording the low because of sight 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:26.319
 dino ciani di porco as we are 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.050
 I feel really shitty if there is 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.190
 one thing I've never been able to do is 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.560
 that we have vacuum cleaners during 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.890
 shooting 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:54.400
 then we have doubts about the wolf of the century 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:56.290

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:05.970

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.610
 when I come back my mother was in a 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.110
 small corner to cry because I am 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.560
