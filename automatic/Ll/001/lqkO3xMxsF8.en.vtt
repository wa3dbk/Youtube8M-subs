hello<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.800> review<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.399> the

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hello guys this is a review of the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.880 
hello guys this is a review of the
cyclone<00:00:03.600> boys<00:00:05.029> 3x3<00:00:06.200> this<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.379> supposed<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.740> be

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
cyclone boys 3x3 this is supposed to be

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.140 
cyclone boys 3x3 this is supposed to be
a<00:00:07.919> white<00:00:08.750> 56<00:00:09.750> millimeters<00:00:10.670> here<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> way

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
a white 56 millimeters here is the way

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.760 
a white 56 millimeters here is the way
long<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:14.269> it's<00:00:15.269> exactly<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.080> same<00:00:16.230> size<00:00:16.500> as<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
long and it's exactly the same size as a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.010 
long and it's exactly the same size as a
way<00:00:16.980> long<00:00:17.990> as<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.410> see

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
way long as you can see

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.160 
way long as you can see
yeah<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.380> mechanism<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.300> Shing<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
yeah the mechanism is like a Shing and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.209 
yeah the mechanism is like a Shing and
f2<00:00:25.939> it<00:00:26.939> has<00:00:27.119> no<00:00:29.240> torpedoes<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:31.650> different

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
f2 it has no torpedoes the different

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.120 
f2 it has no torpedoes the different
type<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.579> plastic<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.630> harder<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.590> smooth

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
type of plastic it's harder and smooth

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.779 
type of plastic it's harder and smooth
the<00:00:35.309> plastics<00:00:36.110> which<00:00:37.110> makes<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.800> really<00:00:38.250> fast

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.810 

corner<00:00:44.789> cutting<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:46.100> 44<00:00:47.100> degrees<00:00:47.129> about

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
corner cutting is up to 44 degrees about

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.459 
corner cutting is up to 44 degrees about
something<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:50.059> yeah<00:00:51.289> maybe<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> little

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
something like this yeah maybe a little

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
something like this yeah maybe a little
less<00:00:56.930> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.199> 45<00:00:58.590> degrees<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.430> gets<00:00:59.670> stuck

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
less if you do 45 degrees it gets stuck

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.130 
less if you do 45 degrees it gets stuck
like<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.570> corner<00:01:03.930> cutting

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
like this and we first corner cutting

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.219 
like this and we first corner cutting
just<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.189> bit

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
just a little bit

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.429 
just a little bit
however<00:01:07.970> em<00:01:08.970> slice<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:10.409> quite<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:15.439> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
however em slice is quite all right and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.399 
however em slice is quite all right and
it's<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.520> nice<00:01:18.390> rounding<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it's because of the nice rounding of the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's because of the nice rounding of the
pieces<00:01:20.810> sticker<00:01:21.810> quality<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.619> bad<00:01:22.799> as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
pieces sticker quality is very bad as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
pieces sticker quality is very bad as
you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> did<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> few<00:01:24.060> solves<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.720> blue

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you can see I did a few solves and blue

00:01:24.990 --> 00:02:15.680 
you can see I did a few solves and blue
is<00:01:25.170> already<00:01:25.830> fading<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> scratching<00:01:27.689> off

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.680 

it's<00:02:16.690> really<00:02:16.900> nice<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.440> think<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:18.880> very<00:02:19.360> cheap

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
it's really nice I think it's very cheap

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.670 
it's really nice I think it's very cheap
cube<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.920> it's<00:02:21.489> also<00:02:21.730> nice<00:02:22.330> it's<00:02:23.140> not<00:02:23.320> as<00:02:23.470> good

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
cube and it's also nice it's not as good

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.100 
cube and it's also nice it's not as good
as<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> Sulha<00:02:24.130> more<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.519> chillum<00:02:25.110> it's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
as a Sulha more a chillum it's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.229 
as a Sulha more a chillum it's
definitely<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> lot<00:02:27.160> faster<00:02:27.700> than<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.940> pseudo

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
definitely a lot faster than a pseudo

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.920 
definitely a lot faster than a pseudo
marginal<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.519> locks<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.300> lot<00:02:31.720> more

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
marginal but it locks up a lot more

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.570 
marginal but it locks up a lot more
because<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:33.160> corner<00:02:33.880> cuts<00:02:34.090> as<00:02:34.870> well<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
because the corner cuts as well and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.540 
because the corner cuts as well and
perhaps<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.540> pops<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.200> don't<00:02:38.830> know<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> haven't

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
perhaps it pops I don't know I haven't

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.030 
perhaps it pops I don't know I haven't
had<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> pop<00:02:39.940> yet<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.620> since<00:02:41.620> there<00:02:41.800> are<00:02:41.920> no

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
had a pop yet but since there are no

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.930 
had a pop yet but since there are no
torpedoes<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.880> suspect<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:43.959> job<00:02:44.500> will<00:02:45.220> pop<00:02:45.700> if

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
torpedoes I suspect this job will pop if

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.620 
torpedoes I suspect this job will pop if
you<00:02:46.150> turn<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:47.140> fast

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
you turn really fast

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.220 
you turn really fast
well<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:51.100> an<00:02:51.310> experience<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.720> one<00:02:52.900> single

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
well I have an experience the one single

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.390 
well I have an experience the one single
pop<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.650> maybe<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:54.610> not<00:02:54.820> true<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:56.190> yeah<00:02:57.190> it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
pop so maybe it's not true and yeah it's

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.079 
pop so maybe it's not true and yeah it's
a<00:02:57.489> fun<00:02:57.670> cube<00:02:57.910> thanks<00:02:58.630> for<00:02:58.780> watching
