00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.539
 and then personal beauty one welcome here 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.330
 channel and the video I'm going to bring today is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.189
 one more message and some bids 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.070
 still what I think is going to happen 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 I did not go here because it's the following 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.329
 I need to give a message here quick as I 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.989
 I will not be able to bread videos in the next 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.640
 two weeks unless you leave one 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.170
 announces next increase should be who 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.530
 I'll talk about what I think it's going to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.940
 everything happens but it's as planned 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 I'm not to prevent putting videos 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.770
 next two weeks because I 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.890
 I'm going to have a very intense test week . 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.570
 so a stressful enough and I 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.829
 I need to focus on the evidence then 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.870
 I'm going to have to leave for a couple of weeks. 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 the channel a little bit orlando okay 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.840
 so just to say that this video does not 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.850
 it was just a warning i solved this is the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 which should appear as responses to the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.030
 people in the next ones and say they will 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 being two is confirmed is that you two 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.360
 But there are people who say they do not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.420
 will have a third of them form 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.900
 on the modus unb is about adding us 1 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.630
 bi 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.390
 The third delight I'm still lacking 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 saying so goes back the next one that goes 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.400
 be the third fourth fifth and in this 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.520
 fifth should be thou that supposedly will 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.280
 to bring is only the map of modes a bis 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.500
 there we will see what still has to be 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 still settled in this story that is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:46.110
 almost coming to a good end first, right? 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.009
 I think the topic that comes most in the head 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.750
 everyone is mobile and as long as the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.340
 context with the story that the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.079
 treyarch she will not make a map that 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.610
 will not get into the right story will not 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.189
 to enter the context of the plot of the story 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.469
 module 1b and how important is it 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.719
 break a cycle in relation to the same 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.810
 plot and the importance that Israel will 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.440
 have in relation to the final context 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.000
 stop max these things is one thing that 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.080
 It has not been clarified yet that I think 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 that will be clarified 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 and should be clarified in the coming 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.850
 maps 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.560
 The second most important thing is 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.450
 complete the third tower 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.300
 We already have a tower in transit and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 another in ISIS and there's going to be the next one. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.370
 map or perhaps the room map that goes 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.400
 bring to us complete this third 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.530
 tower or to stay stop bought max and there 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.910
 seen our third topic right of 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.620
 questioning 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.090
 I found out that each has 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.590
 media planning 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.080
 the stop that is kind of crazy and unpredictable 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.350
 You do not know what he will do after 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.390
 the three that are ready and the max is 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.209
 What is the savior's name? 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.800
 he who will save the land from the stop but 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.410
 as he says he still can not 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.040
 interact with the physical world still 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.090
 people can still already be in something else 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:07.170
 the appearance of max so much is he have acted 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.090
 with this physical world as entering a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.630
 body of a character like this as 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.820
 samantha is on the stop or maybe picking up 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.530
 the control of the zombie is not and it is said 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.480
 wanted to save the planet from a thunderstorm 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.890
 around the world and ends up taking 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.600
 contents one said 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.310
 so we do not know what each one 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.040
 want and we'll have to find out this 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.980
 plan in the next maps and appearance of the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.739
 max is a character who is very old but 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.840
 who has not played the game yet is a 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.360
 important code 5 chain character 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.360
 but he has not scored in the game yet 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.830
 also comes to mind as topics is the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.280
 best explanation of why branch in bad 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.920
 tone to misty and the song were chosen 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.900
 to do these terex both stop 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.300
 as max has other survivors in the 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.459
 but because these four were 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.410
 selected 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.230
 perhaps this is the relationship that the 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.330
 uri shopping had cost 'linger' already 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.090
 because since he laughs shopping he knows 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.010
 passed stringer that already comes to our 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.320
 another questioning my a better 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.420
 relationship between the studio and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.729
 that group the flash that eats meat 1 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.340
 bi knows a better resolution of its 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.380
 spent telling what he did 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.540
 what it will have impact on 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:32.040
 the end of the plot is also the people 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.020
 has the importance of the navicarne the colonel 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.600
 ricardo will serve in the easter egg of 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.330
 transit since the stress of transit will 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.730
 say that it is and has been finished as far as it goes 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.130
 to do because 19 is still missing 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.740
 card there and we do not know what to 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.740
 will be of the importance of this 9 card and 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.680
 also a better resolution than evil 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.330
 Total doing in the yard and with respect to 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.800
 this map will have to transit because 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.690
 if a motorcycle was in the yard of some 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.490
 The way he went to air Israel. 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.010
 There are several theories I know when I go. 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.380
 go into great detail now because I 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.120
 I can not be sure of anything and my 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.240
 Last question I think it goes 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.010
 have a map at least with the turns of the 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.630
 main characters 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.550
 Why a lot of people are asking 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:20.640
 even if treyarch does not make me 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.230
 I think this is how it is. 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.330
 lose some of the intensity of the 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.040
 even because everyone is 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.940
 asking I think it's so cool 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.140
 one round of the four characters 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.520
 main 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.440
 I think somehow they will. 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.680
 back is so much to think it helps a mex 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.120
 or end with the same stop but there 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.920
 People have to see what's going to happen. 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.150
 then you are in some of the 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.900
 questions that I have regarding 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.540
 the way is going to happen are quite 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.060
 topics and they have some of the main 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.070
 That's why they still say they're going to have a 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.180
 supposed to be that it will only be 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.040
 of zombies, right? 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.960
 It will only be zombies that see 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.660
 number of topics to be resolved 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.760
 two maps I think it's too little 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.760
 to solve with the nine ten topics 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.890
 that they have here unless it is 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.540
 various radios in easter egg quezon 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.880
 multiple topics at once 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.250
 now the questions at once is only 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.290
 but by the time it gets a bit complicated 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.650
 to say that you are going to have a farm must be 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.650
 So you can box well, but the 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.810
 ps3 on the pc adele it will be very high 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.760
 along with the code x né 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.960
 so that's what I wanted to train 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.130
 This video hope you guys have 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.740
 liked 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.980
 and I'll bring it if I said it on 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.430
 start of video only if you leave the ad 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:40.260
 3º da lc I 'm going to talk about her opinion 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.730
 in fact not knowing how to license a 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.290
 sovereign position which is something that I 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.140
 I care more where and when the criciúma 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.910
 should be and that's it beauty until the 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.910
 next video and Czech
