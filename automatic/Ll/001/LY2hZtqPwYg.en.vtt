in<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.159> lot<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.340> us<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:48.579> really

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
in a lot of us just really

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
materials so it's kind of like you're

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.480 
materials so it's kind of like you're
not<00:01:54.840> necessarily<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.590> control<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> ink<00:01:56.340> but

it's<00:04:24.520> for<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.820> story<00:04:25.020> so

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.670 

there's<00:04:28.939> a<00:04:28.999> lot<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.539> think<00:04:29.809> about<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.229> terms<00:04:30.259> of

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
there's a lot to think about in terms of

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.410 
there's a lot to think about in terms of
me<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:30.919> what

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
me and what

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.950 
me and what
to<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.660> story<00:04:31.960> our<00:04:32.200> and

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
to the story our and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.800 
to the story our and
trying<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.259> accomplish<00:04:33.500> for<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:33.919> story

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
trying to accomplish for the story

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.840 
trying to accomplish for the story
so<00:04:36.020> that's<00:04:36.230> that's<00:04:36.860> kind<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.190> why<00:04:37.400> when<00:04:37.700> I'm

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
so that's that's kind of why when I'm

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.400 
so that's that's kind of why when I'm
just<00:04:38.300> for<00:04:38.480> fun<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:38.720> just<00:04:38.960> tend<00:04:39.290> to<00:04:39.410> do

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
just for fun I just tend to do

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.040 
just for fun I just tend to do
very<00:04:40.920> spontaneous<00:04:41.640> Russian<00:04:42.630> ink<00:04:42.750> drawing

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
very spontaneous Russian ink drawing

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.490 
very spontaneous Russian ink drawing
into<00:04:43.580> people<00:04:44.580> because<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.060> gives<00:04:45.240> you

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
into people because it gives you

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.010 
into people because it gives you
if<00:04:46.980> someone<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.490> sort<00:04:47.670> of

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
if someone to sort of

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.670 
if someone to sort of
connect<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.220> collaborate<00:04:51.120> with<00:04:51.330> us

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
connect to and collaborate with us

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.529 
connect to and collaborate with us
someone<00:04:53.070> right<00:04:53.220> there<00:04:53.270> well<00:04:54.270> that's

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
someone right there well that's

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.930 
someone right there well that's
understandable<00:04:54.780> but<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.560> is<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:56.190> think<00:04:56.430> at

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
understandable but it is I think at

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.719 
understandable but it is I think at
least<00:04:57.060> from<00:04:57.270> what<00:04:57.360> I've<00:04:57.389> seen<00:04:57.720> in<00:04:57.960> contrast<00:04:58.530> to

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
least from what I've seen in contrast to

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.619 
least from what I've seen in contrast to
you<00:04:59.729> work<00:04:59.940> on<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.210> Dexter<00:05:00.600> series

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
you work on the Dexter series

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.390 
you work on the Dexter series
because<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.289> one<00:05:03.439> looks<00:05:03.650> much<00:05:04.069> more

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
because that one looks much more

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.350 
because that one looks much more
controlled<00:05:05.259> much<00:05:06.259> more

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
controlled much more

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.879 
controlled much more
you<00:05:07.569> know<00:05:07.689> like<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.169> character<00:05:08.650> from<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
you know like the character from the

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.790 
you know like the character from the
show<00:05:09.009> yeah<00:05:09.849> how<00:05:10.300> do<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:10.449> go<00:05:10.629> about<00:05:10.780> trying<00:05:11.379> to

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
show yeah how do you go about trying to

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.320 
show yeah how do you go about trying to
develop<00:05:12.159> that<00:05:12.310> control<00:05:12.699> for<00:05:12.879> something<00:05:13.180> that

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
develop that control for something that

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.540 
develop that control for something that
is<00:05:13.449> supposed<00:05:13.719> to<00:05:13.780> look<00:05:13.990> well<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:15.039> does<00:05:15.280> look

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
is supposed to look well that does look

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.120 
is supposed to look well that does look
different<00:05:15.729> than<00:05:16.030> your<00:05:16.180> normal<00:05:16.210> work

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130

you know every project in doing I'm

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.050 
you know every project in doing I'm
thinking<00:05:20.590> I'm<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:21.160> know<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.460> story<00:05:21.760> first

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
thinking I'm you know it's a story first

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.030 
thinking I'm you know it's a story first
I'm<00:05:22.390> just<00:05:22.450> trying<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.870> develop<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.350> look<00:05:23.590> for<00:05:23.860> it

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
I'm just trying to develop a look for it

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.680 
I'm just trying to develop a look for it
that<00:05:24.280> you<00:05:24.520> like<00:05:24.670> is

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
that you like is

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.570 
that you like is
the<00:05:25.900> most<00:05:26.170> supportive<00:05:26.740> for<00:05:26.950> what<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.250> story

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
the most supportive for what the story

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.870 
the most supportive for what the story
is<00:05:27.670> and<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:28.990> next<00:05:29.350> thing<00:05:29.680> you<00:05:30.670> know<00:05:30.760> the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
is and the next thing you know the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.600 
is and the next thing you know the
likeness<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.450> character<00:05:31.930> is<00:05:32.080> kind<00:05:32.290> of

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
likeness of the character is kind of

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.860 
likeness of the character is kind of
priority<00:05:33.610> for

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.960 

so<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.230> do<00:05:36.710> spend<00:05:37.040> a<00:05:37.130> lot<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.280> time<00:05:37.520> trying<00:05:37.820> to

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
so I do spend a lot of time trying to

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.850 
so I do spend a lot of time trying to
make<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.720> actually<00:05:38.840> look<00:05:39.050> like<00:05:39.260> the

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
make it actually look like the

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.740 
make it actually look like the
characters<00:05:40.370> for<00:05:40.640> that<00:05:40.670> show

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750
