to<00:01:54.930> flip<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> inside<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to flip it inside out so just so you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.530 
to flip it inside out so just so you
know<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.689> particular<00:01:58.020> wetsuit<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.280> d<00:01:59.670> 32<00:02:00.270> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
know this particular wetsuit is d 32 and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
know this particular wetsuit is d 32 and
the<00:02:01.320> other<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> 43<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.970> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the other one here is the 43 and the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
the other one here is the 43 and the
difference<00:02:03.720> between<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> two<00:02:04.439> wet<00:02:04.649> suits<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
difference between the two wet suits is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.300 
difference between the two wet suits is
that<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:06.090> has<00:02:06.689> four<00:02:07.259> millimeter<00:02:07.740> new<00:02:07.920> clean

of ukraine in the shoulders and the arms
of<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> suit<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.880> 32<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
of the suit so this is the 32 with the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.449 
of the suit so this is the 32 with the
two<00:02:28.410> millimeter<00:02:28.830> knee<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.069> made<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
two millimeter knee is made in the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.050 
two millimeter knee is made in the
shoulders<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.970> your<00:02:30.090> arms<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.010> they<00:02:32.700> put<00:02:32.910> that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
shoulders of your arms and they put that

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.360 
shoulders of your arms and they put that
there<00:02:33.180> neoprene<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> shoulders<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
there neoprene in the shoulders in the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.940 
there neoprene in the shoulders in the
arms<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.930> those<00:02:37.170> are<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.350> areas<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.739> we

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
arms because those are the areas that we

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.800 
arms because those are the areas that we
move<00:02:38.100> around<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.519> most<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.780> our

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
move around the most in and so our

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.870 
move around the most in and so our
muscles<00:02:40.349> are<00:02:40.470> naturally<00:02:40.890> creating<00:02:41.280> heat<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
muscles are naturally creating heat and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.110 
muscles are naturally creating heat and
this<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.569> where<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:43.080> also<00:02:43.519> can<00:02:44.519> benefit<00:02:44.940> from<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
this is where we also can benefit from a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.580 
this is where we also can benefit from a
little<00:02:45.150> bit<00:02:45.420> thinner<00:02:45.599> neoprene<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.470> can

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
little bit thinner neoprene so it can

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.949 
little bit thinner neoprene so it can
really<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:47.310> extra<00:02:47.940> stretch<00:02:48.269> as<00:02:48.599> well

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
really have some extra stretch as well

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.350 
really have some extra stretch as well
so<00:02:49.440> you're<00:02:49.890> looking<00:02:50.099> here<00:02:50.519> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> bio<00:02:50.940> place

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
so you're looking here at the bio place

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.680 
so you're looking here at the bio place
neoprene<00:02:51.989> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.920> inside<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.700> suit<00:02:53.940> of

neoprene on the inside of the suit of
the<00:02:54.840> fire<00:02:55.280> you'll<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.670> panel<00:02:57.060> here<00:02:57.360> this

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
the fire you'll see that panel here this

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.140 
the fire you'll see that panel here this
is<00:02:57.840> what's<00:02:58.049> called<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.349> hydro<00:02:58.859> shield<00:02:59.220> the

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
is what's called a hydro shield the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.479 
is what's called a hydro shield the
hydra<00:03:00.570> shield<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.440> actually<00:03:01.950> checking<00:03:02.310> out

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
hydra shield is actually checking out

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.750 
hydra shield is actually checking out
water<00:03:02.820> from<00:03:03.510> pulling<00:03:03.810> into<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.500> soup<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.579> how

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
water from pulling into the soup and how

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.170 
water from pulling into the soup and how
it<00:03:05.910> does<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.500> is<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.430> any<00:03:08.579> water<00:03:08.850> were

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
it does that is that if any water were

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.289 
it does that is that if any water were
to<00:03:09.359> penetrate<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.989> zipper<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:11.519> would<00:03:11.790> come

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
to penetrate the zipper it would come

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.620 
to penetrate the zipper it would come
into<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.900> back<00:03:13.200> area<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.069> get<00:03:14.790> captured<00:03:15.120> and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
into this back area and get captured and

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.509 
into this back area and get captured and
then<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.019> has<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> pinhole<00:03:16.799> down<00:03:17.069> here<00:03:17.340> at<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
then it has a pinhole down here at the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.610 
then it has a pinhole down here at the
lower<00:03:17.760> lumbar<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.930> would<00:03:19.049> allow<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.319> water

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
lower lumbar that would allow the water

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.789 
lower lumbar that would allow the water
to<00:03:19.769> drain<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:21.120> that's<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:22.079> black<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.650> the

synthetic it wicks away water and it

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.759 
synthetic it wicks away water and it
also<00:03:32.209> retains<00:03:33.209> heat<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.139> your<00:03:34.290> body<00:03:34.470> heats

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
also retains heat so as your body heats

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.220 
also retains heat so as your body heats
up<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.069> holds<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.489> heat<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.660> synthetic

up it holds the heat in the synthetic

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.570 
up it holds the heat in the synthetic
material<00:03:37.739> which<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:37.980> one

again that's the bio police that we were
talking<00:03:40.710> about<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.400> suits<00:03:41.700> anatomically

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
talking about this suits anatomically

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.440 
talking about this suits anatomically
cut<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.350> see<00:03:43.410> so<00:03:44.220> naturally<00:03:44.670> cut<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.300> fit

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
