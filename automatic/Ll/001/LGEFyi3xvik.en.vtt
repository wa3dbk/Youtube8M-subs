00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 s 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:16.359
 360 flights per day 20 airlines fly to Knuffingen Airport in Hamburg 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.099
 He is not an exact replica of the airport Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel im 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.449
 Scale 1 to 87 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.320
 Knuffingen Airport is the largest with an area of ​​125 square meters 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.320
 Miniature airport of the world 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.270
 The idea for the project was born in Hamburg by Gerrit Braun 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.750
 that was very early time from 3 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.750
 in the emergence of Wonderland a platform Vienna Airport 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.510
 I found myself 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.720
 strangely never led 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.520
 that we dpa 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.790
 and therefore equal to a value of 2 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.890
 up to 4 6 billion retracted either aircraft busy 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.530
 what they no longer found that discard 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.760
 alone with the planning spent the so-called three and two years 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 For four years he built the costs with 40 other colleagues in the major project 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.960
 Rain Come 5 million euros 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.270
 fifty thousand figures 75 buildings 90 vehicles 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.080
 every single part was made by hand in our own workshop 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.530
 just below the airport for the aircraft was a special mechanics 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.320
 developed 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.229
 In principle, they are just as honest as the little cars 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.480
 Polls so they have Timo built in. Inconceivable front axle 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.230
 and the control made with the new computer normal form words determine courage 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.700
 and power supplies can drive the exports of planes that is with 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.200
 This is about this city Mechernich 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.020
 made 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.020
 and here are two shots to where they were 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.140
 the work is going to be done so that the whole then with this style the drug gangs 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.520
 can be started 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.220
 the biggest challenge and that's starting and landing 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.680
 The so-called rod mechanics moves the aircraft over critical report 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.259
 Speakers hear the visitors the sounds of the machines of each model 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.259
 has its a genes 2 and 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.049
 all movements are controlled by a computer, not yet running 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.340
 everything round and Gerrit Braun jump-start on the runway 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:29.909
 OKAHRA 14 hours a day 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.510
 old systems are coming to the fore here 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.099
 a part of it comes from the left of a lawyer's fire engine 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.439
 that plane through 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.769
 The control software was specially developed for airport operations and 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.769
 is optimized every day 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.969
 Well and how on a real airport is also cuddly carport to the 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.329
 Health Department found 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.980
 to the largest part of Miniatur Wunderland the IKB was named 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.169
 investment 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.659
 3200 square meters she is big Fürth through 8 countries sections from total 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.769
 Thousands of different 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.769
 the longest model railway layout 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:21.089
 Trains and aircraft are monitored at the control center of the River on Strings Bode 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.789
 and business partner Frederic is also there 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:27.129
 Pandev Zanetti will decide if you really want to go to Hamburg airport 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.929
 drive even if I am more of it 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:32.949
 about geography or is in the sense of Hamburg also fits in the wok in love 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.019
 with Buy again way when it is again many landed here in the middle of Hamburg 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.639
 admire 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.859
 Fifth, it was pretty crowded, so to speak, so to speak with our city 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.809
 Want to set a monument 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:47.439
 The Miniatur Wunderland is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.689
 Northern Germany in Hamburg is the most visited exhibition 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.260
 In addition, 1 million visitors a year look at the small world came 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.439
 the lights shine even when men make the adult man a pious 17 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.399
 Countries already short sales had arrived 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.169
 therefore fit 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.980
 in May with 15 minutes 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.159
 Now it will spend the night at the airport for three minutes 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.919
 40 Thousands of Berlin will illuminate the whole section 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.960
 also lands in the dark and equips a machine every two minutes 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.030
 and many a visitor should have already packed this sight at this sight
