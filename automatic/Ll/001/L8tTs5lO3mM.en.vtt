do a respectable job when I say
inexpensive<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:26.840> first<00:00:27.529> break<00:00:27.949> is<00:00:28.390> probably

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
inexpensive the first break is probably

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.090 
inexpensive the first break is probably
thirty<00:00:29.600> years<00:00:29.840> old<00:00:30.020> and<00:00:30.410> I<00:00:30.560> paid<00:00:30.740> eighteen

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
thirty years old and I paid eighteen

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.220 
thirty years old and I paid eighteen
dollars<00:00:31.430> for<00:00:31.640> today<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.449> can<00:00:32.629> get<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:33.019> for

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
dollars for today you can get it for

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.030 
dollars for today you can get it for
like<00:00:33.680> 25<00:00:34.160> or<00:00:34.370> 30<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.750> 30<00:00:36.020> inch<00:00:36.290> break<00:00:36.649> that's

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
like 25 or 30 the 30 inch break that's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.790 
like 25 or 30 the 30 inch break that's
fairly<00:00:37.399> new<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.059> I<00:00:38.540> think<00:00:38.570> I<00:00:38.809> paid<00:00:38.989> $60<00:00:39.770> for

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
fairly new and I think I paid $60 for

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.549 
fairly new and I think I paid $60 for
that<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:41.360> let's<00:00:41.570> take<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> look<00:00:41.989> at<00:00:42.140> these<00:00:42.230> two

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
that so let's take a look at these two

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.830 
that so let's take a look at these two
breaks<00:00:45.340> this<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.399> my<00:00:46.850> original<00:00:47.739> 18-inch<00:00:48.739> break

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
breaks this is my original 18-inch break

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.119 
breaks this is my original 18-inch break
as<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:50.930> can<00:00:51.170> see<00:00:51.410> I've<00:00:51.649> made<00:00:51.710> some

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
as you can see I've made some

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.420 
as you can see I've made some
modifications<00:00:53.680> wallowed<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:54.800> on<00:00:54.950> to<00:00:55.190> this

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
modifications wallowed it on to this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.209 
modifications wallowed it on to this
strip<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.149> steel<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:57.350> that<00:00:57.379> I<00:00:57.620> can<00:00:57.800> mount<00:00:58.010> it

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
strip of steel so that I can mount it

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.819 
strip of steel so that I can mount it
right<00:00:58.370> on<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.059> welding<00:00:59.390> table<00:01:02.140> for<00:01:03.140> me<00:01:03.289> the

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
right on the welding table for me the

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.740 
right on the welding table for me the
secret<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.399> using<00:01:04.759> this<00:01:04.879> break<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.269> getting

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
secret of using this break and getting

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.800 
secret of using this break and getting
the<00:01:05.869> results<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:06.469> I<00:01:06.619> want<00:01:07.149> is<00:01:08.149> first<00:01:08.509> by

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the results that I want is first by

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.129 
the results that I want is first by
squaring<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.590> up<00:01:09.759> make<00:01:10.759> sure<00:01:10.999> that<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:11.420> on

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:12.139 
squaring it up make sure that it's on

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:20.349 
squaring it up make sure that it's on
the<00:01:12.799> line<00:01:16.539> clamping<00:01:17.539> it<00:01:17.659> down<00:01:17.689> tightly<00:01:19.359> now

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
the line clamping it down tightly now

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:21.789 
the line clamping it down tightly now
this<00:01:20.509> is<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.689> little<00:01:20.990> tough<00:01:21.259> right<00:01:21.499> here

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
this is a little tough right here

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.849 
this is a little tough right here
because<00:01:22.099> this<00:01:22.249> is<00:01:22.399> 20<00:01:22.759> gauge<00:01:22.999> sheet<00:01:23.389> metal<00:01:23.859> and

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
because this is 20 gauge sheet metal and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.249 
because this is 20 gauge sheet metal and
I'm<00:01:25.219> doing<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:25.670> from<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.119> side<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:26.990> I'm

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
I'm doing it from the side so that I'm

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
I'm doing it from the side so that I'm
not<00:01:27.499> in<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.950> road<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.459> video

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.160 

this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> where<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> takes<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.189> time

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
this is where it takes some time

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.120 
this is where it takes some time
clamping<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> I'm<00:01:37.530> clamping<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.920> won't

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

with<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.770> copper<00:03:21.770> I<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.490> don't<00:03:22.820> want<00:03:23.060> to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
with this copper I just don't want to

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:33.490 
with this copper I just don't want to
mess<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.800> piece<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.040> copper<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.930> by<00:03:33.140> taking

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
mess up a piece of copper in by taking

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.930 
mess up a piece of copper in by taking
my<00:03:33.620> time<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.330> get<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.510> results<00:03:36.050> that<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.290> want

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
my time I get the results that I want

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.190 
my time I get the results that I want
good<00:03:37.940> sharp<00:03:38.270> bend<00:03:40.150> if<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.300> notice<00:03:41.600> these<00:03:41.780> nuts

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
good sharp bend if you notice these nuts

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.310 
good sharp bend if you notice these nuts
on<00:03:42.440> top<00:03:43.240> one<00:03:44.240> time<00:03:44.480> I<00:03:44.510> had<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.840> lot<00:03:45.170> of

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
on top one time I had a lot of

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.750 
on top one time I had a lot of
repetitive<00:03:45.800> breaking<00:03:46.580> so<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:48.580> drilled<00:03:49.580> some

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
repetitive breaking so I drilled some

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.840 
repetitive breaking so I drilled some
holes<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.210> put<00:03:50.390> these<00:03:50.620> bolts<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.830> with<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
holes and put these bolts in with the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.900 
holes and put these bolts in with the
nuts<00:03:53.090> on<00:03:53.300> top<00:03:53.770> thinking<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.070> would<00:03:55.280> speed

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
nuts on top thinking that it would speed

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.130 
nuts on top thinking that it would speed
up<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.240> process<00:03:57.760> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.970> 30<00:03:59.570> inch<00:03:59.810> break

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
up the process this is the 30 inch break

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.310 
up the process this is the 30 inch break
from<00:04:00.470> Harbor<00:04:00.860> Freight<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.600> for<00:04:02.600> this<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.990> need

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
from Harbor Freight and for this I need

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.620 
from Harbor Freight and for this I need
little<00:04:04.250> deeper<00:04:04.610> throat<00:04:05.030> on<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.410> C<00:04:06.410> clamps

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
little deeper throat on the C clamps

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:16.150 
little deeper throat on the C clamps
oops<00:04:10.120> didn't<00:04:11.120> plan<00:04:11.360> ahead<00:04:11.600> here<00:04:15.160> neither

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
oops didn't plan ahead here neither

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.220 
oops didn't plan ahead here neither
swing<00:04:16.760> these<00:04:16.940> C<00:04:17.330> clamps<00:04:17.750> out<00:04:17.900> of<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.170> road

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
swing these C clamps out of the road

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.020 
swing these C clamps out of the road
now<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.040> wouldn't<00:04:21.370> happen<00:04:21.520> with<00:04:21.910> an

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
now that wouldn't happen with an

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.890 
now that wouldn't happen with an
experienced<00:04:22.660> sheetmetal<00:04:23.170> worker<00:04:24.600> but<00:04:25.600> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
experienced sheetmetal worker but I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.350 
experienced sheetmetal worker but I
don't<00:04:26.350> do<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.500> lot<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:26.770> sheetmetal<00:04:27.070> work<00:04:27.520> so

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
don't do a lot of sheetmetal work so

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.519 
don't do a lot of sheetmetal work so
these<00:04:29.080> are<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.380> kind<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.620> mistakes<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.280> make

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
these are the kind of mistakes I make

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:39.239 
these are the kind of mistakes I make
this<00:04:33.339> break<00:04:33.669> is<00:04:34.979> much<00:04:36.659> better<00:04:37.659> built<00:04:38.139> than<00:04:38.289> the

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:39.249 
this break is much better built than the

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:47.740 
this break is much better built than the
18<00:04:39.849> inch<00:04:40.059> break

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.639 

you

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:54.649 

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.299 

very<00:04:55.279> nice<00:04:55.669> break<00:04:56.179> right<00:04:56.419> here<00:04:56.449> and<00:04:57.309> actually

00:04:58.299 --> 00:04:58.309 
very nice break right here and actually

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:02.559 
very nice break right here and actually
the<00:04:58.489> radius<00:04:59.029> of<00:04:59.359> the<00:04:59.599> bend<00:04:59.899> is<00:05:00.909> just<00:05:01.909> a<00:05:02.239> little

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
the radius of the bend is just a little

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.539 
the radius of the bend is just a little
tighter<00:05:03.259> than<00:05:04.419> with<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.659> 18<00:05:06.169> inch<00:05:06.489> you<00:05:07.489> can

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:07.549 
tighter than with the 18 inch you can

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:09.129 
tighter than with the 18 inch you can
see<00:05:07.819> the<00:05:07.969> bar<00:05:08.179> that<00:05:08.359> goes<00:05:08.419> across<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:09.109> top

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
see the bar that goes across the top

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:14.739 
see the bar that goes across the top
here<00:05:09.379> is<00:05:09.679> solid<00:05:10.459> steel<00:05:12.339> so<00:05:13.339> it<00:05:13.749> obviously

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:14.749 
here is solid steel so it obviously

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.889 
here is solid steel so it obviously
makes<00:05:15.619> some<00:05:16.039> difference<00:05:16.069> in<00:05:16.729> the<00:05:17.479> sharpness

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:17.899 
makes some difference in the sharpness

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.440 
makes some difference in the sharpness
of<00:05:18.079> the<00:05:18.589> bend

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
of the bend

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.900 
of the bend
I'm<00:05:21.170> impressed<00:05:21.680> with<00:05:21.770> this<00:05:22.010> 30-inch<00:05:22.550> break

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
I'm impressed with this 30-inch break

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.240 
I'm impressed with this 30-inch break
and<00:05:23.210> I'm<00:05:23.870> anxious<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.260> see<00:05:24.620> whether<00:05:24.800> Harbor

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
and I'm anxious to see whether Harbor

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.720 
and I'm anxious to see whether Harbor
Freight<00:05:25.660> 18<00:05:26.660> inch<00:05:26.870> break<00:05:27.200> is<00:05:27.410> built<00:05:28.220> as<00:05:28.430> well

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
Freight 18 inch break is built as well

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.980 
Freight 18 inch break is built as well
as<00:05:29.030> this<00:05:29.360> 30<00:05:29.630> inch<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:32.000> bar<00:05:32.360> for<00:05:32.720> the

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
as this 30 inch this is the bar for the

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.520 
as this 30 inch this is the bar for the
18<00:05:33.530> inch<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.070> you<00:05:35.030> can<00:05:35.210> see<00:05:35.480> that<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.110> much

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
18 inch and you can see that it is much

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.100 
18 inch and you can see that it is much
lighter
