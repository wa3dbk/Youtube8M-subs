00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.080
 talk about an important point of the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.880
 strategy the nature of your sides you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.710
 you are all probably already 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.950
 account that each of your pokemon had 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 a goal he was shy associate 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.279
 rigid assured calm in everything there are 25 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.080
 potions you have to know that it does not affect 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.710
 nothing about the personality of your 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.600
 pokemon 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.900
 no it's a goal that's purely 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.119
 strategic each of the nature has a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.340
 specific effect on statistics 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.100
 that is, they increase 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.360
 one of the statues 10% is it down 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.640
 another 10% on pokemon x and y 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 you can even see it directly the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.920
 augmented statistic is in red then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.910
 that the one that is pc is angle in itself 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.430
 it's something really 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.390
 important 10% it's really not the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.370
 everything to neglect 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.590
 and it can often increase the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.719
 strengths of your small roles as well 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.460
 strategists are often used to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.530
 choose a nature that increases 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.359
 then necessarily a strong point but who 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.700
 drop a statistic we do not have 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.560
 need for example if I play myself 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.430
 fleming currency that has a very very 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.140
 big attack 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 I will necessarily put him four 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 physical attacks so I would not have 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 need my special attack at this 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.960
 moment I can choose the best being 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.880
 and the rigid nature where I come why 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.600
 well because I lost 10% in 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 special attack 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.659
 and as we do not use it well, we 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.400
 do not care 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 if you understand 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.330
 you understood the great principle of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.940
 nature and how to use it in 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.710
 strategy after you have to know that there is 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.040
 certain natures that do not change the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.490
 everything if your pokemon is weird back he 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.370
 a modest rethinking where serious there is 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.660
 no change in his statistics 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.940
 but I do not recommend the use 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.100
 of this nature even though it may seem 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.510
 to be the easy way 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.060
 when we do strategy we 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.310
 will always prefer to take advantage of the boom of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.170
 10% rather than having a nature that does not 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.820
 change nothing at all about 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.010
 natures have strategy we find in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.940
 always do the same pokemon 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.560
 aggressive 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.960
 if they are physical will be very often 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.179
 less rigid times josiane if they are 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.280
 special it will be either modest or 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.410
 shy and that's very often the case 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 where a defensive pokemon is very 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.880
 often assured calm 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 clever or cautious now we come to 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.690
 the bad news nature is 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.090
 exactly like the ive and its data 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.709
 catching or hatching the offer 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.260
 on your side there it can not be 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.300
 changed six months a pokemon problem 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 shine who as they are caught a 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.380
 little bit at random have a nature that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.480
 is not usually terrible 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.340
 luckily there is a solution there is 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.130
 has even several to choose and for 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.290
 influence 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.850
 nature of these pokemon the fastest and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.070
 the most radical thing is to go through 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.560
 abstention why because if you 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.380
 give a mass piece to the mother of your 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.120
 babies they will all have the same nature as 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.250
 the same we will make a small example 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.710
 to illustrate all this I have the chance 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.530
 to have a female and nature fenard 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.420
 modest if I put it to the pension and 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.880
 that I make him hold the stone stasse 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.400
 all the cut off x that 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.830
 I would get they too will be modest 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.170
 to stop dreaming I know that 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.420
 base you have to have a pokemon 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.920
 with the good nature and it's true that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.110
 for that there is still a solution 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.790
 ideally what it takes is a stock 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.450
 of metamorph with natures 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.580
 different 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.430
 why, because otherwise your death 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.620
 play the role of mom it will work 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.690
 also with the sadness and all the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.430
 babies will have the same nature as the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.650
 metamorph it does not look for you 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.170
 sometimes very long in the high 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.760
 herbs the good pokemon who the good nature 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.710
 and who in addition is a female 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.050
 there is also a little technique that 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.540
 is to use the special ability 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.420
 no big indeed if you put a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.390
 pokemon with this special ability in 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.460
 head of your team you have 50 % of 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.590
 chances to meet pokemon 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.330
 wild with the same nature as the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.980
 pokemon who synchro 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.420
 I put you in the details of the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.130
 video a painting will be able to see the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.590
 summary of all natures 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.510
 pokemon is necessarily able to watch 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.980
 your pokemon what is the nature and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.550
 what are the tracks and the effects 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.770
 negative 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.690
 if the small media picture that is 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.970
 nice enough and that also gives the 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.190
 name of nature in English bah yes because 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.720
 that you know the strategists they 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.070
 are going to talk to you about nature only 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.070
 in English that it's done we have to 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.780
 class here I hope you did well 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.670
 understood this little point about the strategy 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.800
 nature it's really not something 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.420
 something to overlook especially if you 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.310
 decide to do chiropodists really 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810
 elaborated you will see that it can 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.180
 quickly make a difference 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.860
 good I do not think I'll leave you 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.500
 on at a little point of reflection 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.600
 interesting if you had to choose a 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.360
 nature of pokemon for you defined 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.500
 what would that be me I think 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.290
 I will surely be calm assured or so 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.930
 to be modest or so I 'll be 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.760
 shy but maybe I 'll be 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.500
 weird finally I do not know I'm good 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.100
 leave to his thoughts and I tell you to 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.100
 very soon
