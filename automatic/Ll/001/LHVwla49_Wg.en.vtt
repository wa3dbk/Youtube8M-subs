00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.750
 and not recreate the depth and the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.880
 position of objects in space 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 the perspective starts to use 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.610
 fully in the Renaissance 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 before from the Egyptians and up to the age 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.230
 medium , the figures of major or 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 smaller size according to its importance 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.800
 the representation of the figures is 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.839
 based on an abstract ideal the figures 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.479
 they had two legs and five fingers in each 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.120
 hand even though they did not look like the 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.059
 reality that we see 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.520
 the composition in these cases reflected 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.010
 another reality that can not be seen 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.790
 simple view of a society 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.769
 specific with its own hierarchies 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.780
 during the low middle age the artists 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.240
 they were trying to get some idea of 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.230
 perspective playing with the size and the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.050
 Location of objects 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.660
 the most distant objects were located in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.250
 the top of the box of the most 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.470
 near the bottom 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.110
 like other artists who followed him 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.390
 kioto considered the antecessor of 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.580
 Italian renaissance was looking for 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.190
 represent space through the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.260
 observation of nature 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.650
 with works like the annunciation and the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.510
 FrangiÃ©licic trinity and more h achieved 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.180
 the feeling of space through the 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.760
 conical perspective where the lines 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.970
 Parallels of an object are found in 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.490
 a vanishing point so the figures go 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.890
 reducing with distance provoking 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.860
 the illusion of depth 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.270
 between 1400 16,420 filippo brunelleschi 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.000
 Florentine artist and architect of the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.800
 Renaissance made a series of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.400
 studies to be able to represent 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.789
 buildings in perspective and discovered the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.320
 geometric principles of perspective 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.840
 where the cone that forms the look of the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.230
 observer collides with the objects that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.120
 Objects are within your reach 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.520
 they seem smaller the further away 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.790
 is it so 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.370
 at the end of the 15th century and in the 16th it 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.310
 perfects the perspective 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.410
 perspective as we use it today the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.170
 Piero della Francesca development to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.840
 mid 15th century and it became 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.000
 a mathematical theory 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.580
 Leonardo da Vinci made great 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.300
 contributions in this regard in its 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.390
 treaty of the painting of 1,480 wrote 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.720
 that both the color and the shape lose 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.670
 clarity as the distance increases in 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.099
 the Mannerist painting that came after 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 it was no longer an attempt to represent 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.010
 reality as we see it but it is 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.090
 he started playing with the perspective 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.970
 moving the vanishing point or 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.870
 multiplying how they were created 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.579
 false perspectives and distorted 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.590
 deliberately the proportions for 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.410
 achieve an emotional effect of artistic 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 more than realistic 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.970
 from there on they have been adopted 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
 unusual perspectives and it has 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.460
 experienced more with light color and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.040
 the movement opened up like a fan 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.370
 unlimited possibilities for the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.380
 artist explore in his canvases where the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.350
 representation of reality as the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.900
 we see is not necessarily more valid or 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.690
 better than other representations that 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.240
 may seem less realistic like this 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.970
 we finish this brief tour of the 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.870
 history of perspective in art 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.870
 I hope you enjoyed it
