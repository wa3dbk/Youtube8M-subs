00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that's what it looks like and I was

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.229 
that's what it looks like and I was
really<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.170> skeptical<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.940> week

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
really really skeptical about this week

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.600 
really really skeptical about this week
because<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.290> bottom<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.370> really

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
because the bottom is like really really

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.599 
because the bottom is like really really
thin<00:00:39.059> but<00:00:39.359> I<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.539> like<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.109> bangs<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
thin but I do like the bangs but I

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.430 
thin but I do like the bangs but I
thought<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.449> been<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.930> cute
