music a program called guitar pro 5 I've
uses<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> lot<00:00:13.349> over<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> years<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.250> think<00:00:14.849> I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
uses a lot over the years I think I

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.880 
uses a lot over the years I think I
started<00:00:15.150> using<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.599> two<00:00:15.750> thousand<00:00:16.199> anyway

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
started using it in two thousand anyway

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.599 
started using it in two thousand anyway
here<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:19.039> this<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.100> guitar<00:00:20.789> pro<00:00:21.090> five<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
here it is this is guitar pro five and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
here it is this is guitar pro five and
i'm<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.510> demonstrate<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.350> way<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
i'm just going to demonstrate a way of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.419 
i'm just going to demonstrate a way of
realizing<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.970> major<00:00:27.210> scale<00:00:27.630> now<00:00:28.560> normally<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
realizing a major scale now normally a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.229 
realizing a major scale now normally a
major<00:00:29.760> scale<00:00:31.189> would<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.399> harmonizing<00:00:32.940> thirds

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
major scale would be harmonizing thirds

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.190 
major scale would be harmonizing thirds
and<00:00:34.489> that's<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.670> pretty<00:00:35.910> straightforward<00:00:36.630> sort

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and that's a pretty straightforward sort

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
and that's a pretty straightforward sort
of<00:00:37.290> sound<00:00:37.530> everybody<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:38.850> less

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
of sound everybody is more or less

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
of sound everybody is more or less
acquainted<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.050> sort<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.379> like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
acquainted with that it's sort of like

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.270 
acquainted with that it's sort of like
root<00:00:41.370> third<00:00:41.670> fifth<00:00:41.700> da<00:00:42.570> da<00:00:42.809> da<00:00:42.870> da<00:00:43.079> right<00:00:43.379> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
root third fifth da da da da right but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.650 
root third fifth da da da da right but
what<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:46.910> portal<00:00:47.910> harmony<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
what you can do with portal harmony is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.920 
what you can do with portal harmony is
we<00:00:49.140> harmonize<00:00:49.440> an<00:00:50.219> entire<00:00:50.670> scale<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
we harmonize an entire scale in the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.310 
we harmonize an entire scale in the
fourth<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:54.090> instead<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.930> typical

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
fourth so you instead of your typical

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220 
fourth so you instead of your typical
sound<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.280> C<00:00:56.520> major<00:00:56.670> 7<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.899> II

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
sound like C major 7 or you know II

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.220 
sound like C major 7 or you know II
minor<00:00:58.680> 7<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.219> whatever<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.820> would<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
minor 7 or whatever you would have a a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
minor 7 or whatever you would have a a
totally<00:01:01.920> different<00:01:02.280> chord<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> would

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
totally different chord and it would

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.679 
totally different chord and it would
sound<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> took<00:01:04.680> G<00:01:04.949> major<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
sound like this so if you took G major I

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:17.350 
sound like this so if you took G major I
just<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> put<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.439> here

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.340 

so<00:01:18.360> that's<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.259> sounds<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.740> um<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
so that's what that sounds like um and I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.920 
so that's what that sounds like um and I
got<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> concept<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> book<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.540> guitar

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
got the concept from a book my guitar

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.120 
got the concept from a book my guitar
teacher<00:01:25.170> wrote<00:01:25.939> several<00:01:26.939> years<00:01:27.420> ago<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.770> he

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
teacher wrote several years ago and he

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.539 
teacher wrote several years ago and he
was<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.310> large<00:01:29.549> fan<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.180> Lenny<00:01:30.990> Breau<00:01:31.430> who<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
was a large fan of Lenny Breau who is a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.950 
was a large fan of Lenny Breau who is a
Canadian<00:01:33.000> jazz<00:01:33.240> guitarist<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:35.630> he<00:01:36.630> was<00:01:36.810> known

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
Canadian jazz guitarist and he was known

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.570 
Canadian jazz guitarist and he was known
to<00:01:36.990> incorporate<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.680> technique<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.159> lot<00:01:38.340> in

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
to incorporate this technique a lot in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.490 
to incorporate this technique a lot in
his<00:01:38.759> playing<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.140> listening<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
his playing and I was just listening to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920 
his playing and I was just listening to
an<00:01:40.740> album<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.100> his<00:01:41.220> today<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.600> was

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
an album with his today and I was

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.330 
an album with his today and I was
thinking<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:43.950> really<00:01:43.979> does

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
thinking well you know he really does

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.050 
thinking well you know he really does
use<00:01:44.520> these<00:01:44.700> chords<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> lot<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.940> looking<00:01:47.940> at

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
use these chords a lot so looking at

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
use these chords a lot so looking at
these<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> standard<00:01:49.590> notation

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
these you can see the standard notation

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
these you can see the standard notation
and<00:01:51.770> tablature<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.460> well<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.080> pretty

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and tablature here as well so it pretty

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
and tablature here as well so it pretty
much<00:01:55.289> looks<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.770> guitar<00:01:55.979> magazine<00:01:56.340> sort

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
much looks like a guitar magazine sort

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.469 
much looks like a guitar magazine sort
of<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.569> tab<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.709> know<00:01:58.860> zooming<00:01:59.850> in<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.000> bit<00:02:00.240> more

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
of a tab to know zooming in a bit more

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.710 
of a tab to know zooming in a bit more
here<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.209> this<00:02:03.209> would<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.319> know<00:02:04.440> g<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.009> b<00:02:05.190> c<00:02:05.819> d

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
here so this would be you know g a b c d

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.910 
here so this would be you know g a b c d
e<00:02:09.170> f-sharp<00:02:10.170> G<00:02:10.769> so<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.760> G<00:02:12.030> major<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
e f-sharp G so that would be G major and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.910 
e f-sharp G so that would be G major and
there<00:02:13.920> are<00:02:14.040> two<00:02:14.220> fourths<00:02:14.640> built<00:02:14.940> off<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.920> off

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
there are two fourths built off of off

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.650 
there are two fourths built off of off
of<00:02:17.220> every<00:02:17.489> degree<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.850> can<00:02:20.970> see<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.299> for<00:02:21.510> no

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
of every degree you can see there for no

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.050 
of every degree you can see there for no
cords<00:02:22.049> as<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.609> up<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.790> is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
cords as well so that and up there is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
cords as well so that and up there is
the<00:02:24.180> notation<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.079> can<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.410> that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the notation and you can see that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.080 
the notation and you can see that
they're<00:02:25.739> further<00:02:26.160> apart<00:02:26.519> in<00:02:26.700> your<00:02:26.730> typical

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
they're further apart in your typical

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.479 
they're further apart in your typical
thirds<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.769> course<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:29.190> apply<00:02:29.430> this

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
thirds and of course you can apply this

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.030 
thirds and of course you can apply this
to<00:02:29.790> other<00:02:29.970> scales<00:02:30.390> such<00:02:30.720> as<00:02:30.959> Dorian<00:02:31.320> over<00:02:31.799> here

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to other scales such as Dorian over here

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:45.220 
to other scales such as Dorian over here
this<00:02:32.640> would<00:02:32.850> be<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> Dorian<00:02:33.620> sounds<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.709> this

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:58.490 

d<00:02:46.230> mix<00:02:46.470> LAN<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.329> major<00:02:58.019> doryan

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
d mix LAN so there you have major doryan

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
d mix LAN so there you have major doryan
and<00:02:58.829> mixolydian<00:02:59.159> then<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.030> have<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> muscle<00:03:00.540> of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
and mixolydian then I have the muscle of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.460 
and mixolydian then I have the muscle of
the<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.709> string<00:03:02.190> root<00:03:04.010> then<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the a string root then here so this

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:36.160 
the a string root then here so this
would<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.680> C<00:03:08.010> major<00:03:08.250> D<00:03:17.359> Dorian<00:03:26.780> G<00:03:27.780> mixolydian

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.680 

final<00:03:37.170> even<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> life<00:03:37.680> minor<00:03:38.540> what's<00:03:39.540> his

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
final even the life minor what's his

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:50.940 
final even the life minor what's his
then<00:03:39.870> he<00:03:40.079> receive<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.560> lot<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.799> glitter

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:04.660 

then<00:03:51.950> route<00:03:52.310> 6<00:04:01.599> so<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:03.770> application<00:04:04.459> for

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
then route 6 so the application for

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.360 
then route 6 so the application for
these<00:04:04.819> chords<00:04:05.450> would<00:04:06.260> be<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.800> substitute<00:04:07.340> for

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
these chords would be to substitute for

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.050 
these chords would be to substitute for
your<00:04:07.850> standard<00:04:08.300> jazz<00:04:08.540> towards<00:04:10.000> let<00:04:11.000> me

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
demonstrate Jenner jazz voicings are

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.680 
demonstrate Jenner jazz voicings are
used<00:04:15.170> by<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.769> lot<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.790> guitarists<00:04:17.389> and<00:04:17.480> it's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
used by a lot of guitarists and it's

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.250 
used by a lot of guitarists and it's
perfectly<00:04:18.019> acceptable<00:04:18.109> but<00:04:19.209> bill<00:04:20.209> evans<00:04:20.450> as<00:04:20.900> i

understand<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.799> was<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.070> pioneer<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.580> this

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
understand it was the pioneer of this

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.980 
understand it was the pioneer of this
style<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.270> he<00:04:23.660> started<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.320> use<00:04:25.280> these

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
style and he started to use these

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.680 
style and he started to use these
fourths<00:04:26.990> on<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.410> album<00:04:27.680> kind<00:04:27.950> of<00:04:28.070> blue<00:04:28.690> by

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690

fourths on the album kind of blue by
Miles<00:04:29.900> Davis<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:30.620> he<00:04:31.130> was<00:04:31.310> basically<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
Miles Davis so he was basically the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.520 
Miles Davis so he was basically the
piano<00:04:32.270> player<00:04:32.540> four<00:04:32.810> miles<00:04:32.960> Davis<00:04:33.080> and

piano player four miles Davis and
introduced<00:04:33.919> his<00:04:34.070> entire<00:04:34.430> new<00:04:34.669> idea<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.389> portal

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
introduced his entire new idea of portal

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.520 
introduced his entire new idea of portal
harmony<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:37.330> one<00:04:38.330> thing<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.840> had<00:04:39.500> to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
harmony so one thing I had to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.050 
harmony so one thing I had to
demonstrate<00:04:39.770> on<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.760> just<00:04:40.970> had<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:43.060> whole

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
demonstrate on but I just had a whole

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.080 
demonstrate on but I just had a whole
251<00:04:44.960> progressive<00:04:46.300> would<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:48.400> basically<00:04:49.400> you

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
251 progressive would be basically you

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.159 
251 progressive would be basically you
know<00:04:50.240> what<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.479> sound<00:04:50.690> something<00:04:50.840> like

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.040 

something<00:04:54.169> like<00:04:54.289> that<00:04:54.620> right<00:04:54.919> in<00:04:55.190> G<00:04:55.550> major<00:04:56.050> it

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
something like that right in G major it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.570 
something like that right in G major it
would<00:04:57.169> just<00:04:57.289> basically<00:04:57.470> have<00:04:58.039> your<00:04:58.280> typical

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
would just basically have your typical

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.320 
would just basically have your typical
sort<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.330> minor<00:04:59.960> shape<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:01.039> then<00:05:01.190> d<00:05:01.789> 7<00:05:02.150> shape

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
sort of a minor shape and then d 7 shape

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.940 
sort of a minor shape and then d 7 shape
and<00:05:02.660> G<00:05:03.190> major<00:05:04.190> said<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.870> what<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.590> can<00:05:06.740> do<00:05:06.830> is

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
and G major said and what you can do is

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.719 
and G major said and what you can do is
you<00:05:07.070> can<00:05:07.100> put<00:05:07.729> these<00:05:07.880> chords<00:05:08.390> in<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:09.729> be

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
you can put these chords in and be

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.730 
you can put these chords in and be
harmonized<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.450> entire<00:05:11.780> progression<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:12.680> you

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
harmonized the entire progression so you

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.310 
harmonized the entire progression so you
would<00:05:13.130> have<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:14.270> Dorian<00:05:14.900> quarrel<00:05:15.650> cord<00:05:19.180> and

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
would have the a Dorian quarrel cord and

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.570 
would have the a Dorian quarrel cord and
then<00:05:21.320> d<00:05:21.770> mixolydian<00:05:22.190> quarrel<00:05:22.760> cord

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.790 

or<00:05:26.580> even<00:05:26.790> if<00:05:27.170> you<00:05:28.170> wanted<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.470> add<00:05:28.620> another

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
or even if you wanted to add another

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:40.370 
or even if you wanted to add another
fourth<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:31.160> then<00:05:32.160> a<00:05:32.220> g-major<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:39.360> those<00:05:39.600> notes

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
fourth and then a g-major so those notes

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.130 
fourth and then a g-major so those notes
are<00:05:40.770> as<00:05:41.010> follows<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.700> is<00:05:42.030> an<00:05:42.300> A<00:05:42.660> D<00:05:44.060> G<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.390> C

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:55.340 

and<00:05:49.400> after<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.520> D<00:05:50.730> it<00:05:51.090> would<00:05:51.300> be<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.710> DG<00:05:52.710> C<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:54.350> F

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
and after the D it would be a DG C and F

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.470 
and after the D it would be a DG C and F
sharp<00:05:57.110> you<00:05:58.110> can<00:05:58.260> also<00:05:58.410> add<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.850> be<00:05:59.850> if<00:06:00.090> you<00:06:00.210> like

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
sharp you can also add a be if you like

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:08.090 
sharp you can also add a be if you like
and<00:06:01.669> then<00:06:02.669> G<00:06:03.120> major<00:06:03.330> would<00:06:04.290> have<00:06:04.320> G<00:06:04.890> C<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:07.100> F

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
and then G major would have G C and F

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.510 
and then G major would have G C and F
sharp<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:10.250> ste<00:06:11.250> again<00:06:11.640> for<00:06:12.650> no<00:06:13.650> sorry<00:06:14.190> I'm

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.560 

as<00:06:35.980> you<00:06:36.130> just<00:06:36.160> play<00:06:36.490> the<00:06:36.700> open<00:06:36.970> for<00:06:37.210> borrowed

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
as you just play the open for borrowed

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.040 
as you just play the open for borrowed
notes<00:06:37.840> those<00:06:38.800> are<00:06:39.010> all<00:06:39.070> fourths<00:06:39.630> the<00:06:40.630> B<00:06:40.750> string

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
notes those are all fourths the B string

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.440 
notes those are all fourths the B string
is<00:06:41.200> a<00:06:41.260> third<00:06:41.530> and<00:06:41.860> then<00:06:42.580> back<00:06:42.790> to<00:06:42.940> forest<00:06:43.210> again

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
is a third and then back to forest again

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.360 
is a third and then back to forest again
so<00:06:43.780> all<00:06:44.020> you<00:06:44.050> have<00:06:44.170> to<00:06:44.290> basically<00:06:44.530> remember<00:06:45.220> is

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
so all you have to basically remember is

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.460 
so all you have to basically remember is
where<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.700> thirds<00:06:45.970> are<00:06:46.360> and<00:06:46.630> then<00:06:47.200> you<00:06:47.320> can

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
where the thirds are and then you can

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.230 
where the thirds are and then you can
start<00:06:48.330> sort<00:06:49.330> of<00:06:49.420> transposing<00:06:49.930> these<00:06:50.260> all<00:06:50.500> over

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
start sort of transposing these all over

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.330 
start sort of transposing these all over
to<00:06:52.240> any<00:06:52.390> key<00:06:52.600> that<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:52.810> want<00:06:53.110> as<00:06:53.650> easily<00:06:53.890> as

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
to any key that you want as easily as

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.700 
to any key that you want as easily as
anything<00:06:54.580> because<00:06:55.030> it's<00:06:55.360> it's<00:06:56.020> a<00:06:56.140> guitar<00:06:56.440> like

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
anything because it's it's a guitar like

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.800 
anything because it's it's a guitar like
I<00:06:56.950> would<00:06:57.070> use<00:06:57.250> these<00:06:57.850> in<00:06:58.000> the<00:06:58.090> Dorian<00:06:58.450> setting

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
I would use these in the Dorian setting

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:13.920 
I would use these in the Dorian setting
like<00:06:59.230> save<00:06:59.500> a<00:06:59.530> file<00:06:59.830> is<00:06:59.950> d<00:07:00.190> Jorian<00:07:10.980> and<00:07:12.810> if<00:07:13.810> I

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
like save a file is d Jorian and if I

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:25.110 
like save a file is d Jorian and if I
wanted<00:07:14.140> to<00:07:14.200> go<00:07:14.380> to<00:07:14.440> e<00:07:14.530> plat<00:07:14.830> Dorian<00:07:23.730> add<00:07:24.730> that

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
wanted to go to e plat Dorian add that

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.390 
wanted to go to e plat Dorian add that
so<00:07:25.300> problem<00:07:25.660> that's<00:07:25.900> obviously<00:07:26.560> no<00:07:26.770> physical

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
so problem that's obviously no physical

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.780 
so problem that's obviously no physical
strain<00:07:27.630> so<00:07:28.630> I<00:07:28.660> i<00:07:29.290> would<00:07:29.680> recommend<00:07:30.100> that<00:07:30.220> if

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
strain so I i would recommend that if

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.450 
strain so I i would recommend that if
you<00:07:30.910> play<00:07:31.090> jazz<00:07:31.420> and<00:07:32.110> the<00:07:32.140> fire<00:07:32.560> into<00:07:33.280> more

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:33.460 
you play jazz and the fire into more

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.560 
you play jazz and the fire into more
modern<00:07:33.760> jazz<00:07:33.970> you<00:07:34.000> should<00:07:34.330> try<00:07:34.510> this

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570 
modern jazz you should try this

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.660 
modern jazz you should try this
technique<00:07:34.930> especially<00:07:35.680> if<00:07:36.100> your<00:07:36.220> guitarist

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:36.670 
technique especially if your guitarist

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.870 
technique especially if your guitarist
because<00:07:37.090> you<00:07:38.050> can<00:07:38.230> take<00:07:38.410> advantage<00:07:38.530> of<00:07:39.010> the<00:07:39.250> of

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:39.880 
because you can take advantage of the of

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.960 
because you can take advantage of the of
the<00:07:40.270> tuning<00:07:40.630> of<00:07:40.780> the<00:07:41.200> instrument<00:07:41.740> to

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:41.970 
the tuning of the instrument to

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.340 
the tuning of the instrument to
implement<00:07:42.970> some<00:07:43.120> pretty<00:07:43.300> far<00:07:43.510> out<00:07:43.660> ideas<00:07:43.990> that

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.350 
implement some pretty far out ideas that

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.250 
implement some pretty far out ideas that
would<00:07:44.470> be<00:07:44.620> very<00:07:44.770> difficult<00:07:45.010> on<00:07:45.370> piano<00:07:45.670> so<00:07:46.480> I

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.260 
would be very difficult on piano so I

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.770 
would be very difficult on piano so I
will<00:07:47.830> try<00:07:47.950> to<00:07:48.010> put<00:07:48.280> this<00:07:48.400> file<00:07:48.640> up<00:07:48.940> it's<00:07:49.180> a<00:07:49.270> gp5

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.780 
will try to put this file up it's a gp5

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.670 
will try to put this file up it's a gp5
file<00:07:50.230> it's<00:07:50.830> basically<00:07:51.130> a<00:07:51.250> tab<00:07:51.580> so<00:07:52.390> i'll<00:07:52.690> try

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 
file it's basically a tab so i'll try

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.860 
file it's basically a tab so i'll try
and<00:07:53.800> host<00:07:53.950> out<00:07:54.130> on<00:07:54.250> one<00:07:54.340> of<00:07:54.370> my<00:07:54.490> pages<00:07:54.760> and<00:07:55.180> i'll
