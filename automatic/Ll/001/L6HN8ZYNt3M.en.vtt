the<00:01:49.760> stealth<00:01:50.120> component<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.840> big<00:01:51.080> part<00:01:51.410> of

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the stealth component is a big part of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.350 
the stealth component is a big part of
using<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.979> environment<00:01:52.100> like<00:01:52.670> finding

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
using the environment like finding

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.150 
using the environment like finding
intelligent<00:01:53.960> places<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.440> hide<00:01:54.650> that<00:01:54.890> give<00:01:55.070> you

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
intelligent places to hide that give you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.700 
intelligent places to hide that give you
flank<00:01:55.460> groups<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.540> yeah<00:01:56.720> I<00:01:56.780> analyzed<00:01:57.440> the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
flank groups and yeah I analyzed the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.590 
flank groups and yeah I analyzed the
space<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.369> they're<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.970> they<00:01:59.030> they<00:01:59.360> know

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
space that they're in and they they know

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600 
space that they're in and they they know
like<00:01:59.990> here's<00:02:00.290> a<00:02:00.350> place<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.770> hide<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.340> will

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
like here's a place to hide that will

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.910 
like here's a place to hide that will
allow<00:02:02.180> me<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.360> flank<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.930> player<00:02:03.170> around<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
allow me to flank the player around the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.350 
allow me to flank the player around the
sides<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:09.740> space<00:02:10.160> you're<00:02:10.490> playing<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.150> an

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
sides the space you're playing in is an

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.120 
sides the space you're playing in is an
extra<00:02:11.810> character<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.860> gonna<00:02:13.010> change

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
extra character and it's gonna change

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.470 
extra character and it's gonna change
the<00:02:13.670> dynamic<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.600> every<00:02:15.020> combat

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.790 

and<00:02:20.630> then<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:20.840> an<00:02:20.930> encounter<00:02:21.200> happens<00:02:21.680> we

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and then when an encounter happens we

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.340 
and then when an encounter happens we
want<00:02:21.980> things<00:02:22.460> to<00:02:22.580> slow<00:02:22.730> down<00:02:23.030> I'm<00:02:23.540> gonna<00:02:23.870> use

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
want things to slow down I'm gonna use

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.810 
want things to slow down I'm gonna use
this<00:02:24.650> thing<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.980> we<00:02:25.100> call<00:02:25.130> listen<00:02:25.640> mode

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
this thing that we call listen mode

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.250 
this thing that we call listen mode
let's<00:02:26.120> Joe<00:02:26.360> kind<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.600> focus<00:02:27.080> his<00:02:27.230> attention

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
let's Joe kind of focus his attention

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.580 
let's Joe kind of focus his attention
his<00:02:27.890> hearing<00:02:28.780> I'll<00:02:29.780> check<00:02:29.990> out<00:02:30.140> their<00:02:30.320> theory

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
his hearing I'll check out their theory

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.180 
his hearing I'll check out their theory
we'll<00:02:31.130> check<00:02:31.340> over<00:02:31.520> there

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
we'll check over there

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.440 
we'll check over there
the<00:02:34.190> guy's<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.550> gonna<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.970> /<00:02:35.240> or<00:02:35.330> he's
