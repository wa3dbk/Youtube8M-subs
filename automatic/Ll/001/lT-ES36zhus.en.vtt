00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.440 
dollars for I wish it was $25 and you go
on<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.659> Google<00:01:25.369> mcat<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.939> take<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
on if you go in Google mcat or take the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
on if you go in Google mcat or take the
mcat<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.170> first<00:01:28.409> website<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.070> will<00:01:29.130> pop<00:01:29.340> up

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
mcat the first website that will pop up

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.899 
mcat the first website that will pop up
will<00:01:29.790> probably<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.799> am<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.950> website<00:01:32.610> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
will probably be the am a website and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.749 
will probably be the am a website and
then<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.329> schedule<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.110> impact<00:01:34.759> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
then you can schedule the impact that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.539 
then you can schedule the impact that
way<00:01:36.079> when<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.380> schedule<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> mcat<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
way when you do schedule the mcat and

use but I would say the biggest advice
with<00:02:57.389> studying<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.109> mcat<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.739> when

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
with studying for the mcat is when

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.830 
with studying for the mcat is when
you're<00:02:59.220> taking<00:02:59.459> these<00:02:59.790> courses<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.599> first

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
you're taking these courses the first

you don't have to learn when you study
for<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.859> mcat<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.730> have<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.090> refresh<00:03:12.450> up

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
for the mcat you just have to refresh up

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.099 
for the mcat you just have to refresh up
on<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.139> so<00:03:13.739> um<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.459> know<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.420> may<00:03:15.659> not<00:03:15.690> like

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
on it so um I know you may not like

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.960 
on it so um I know you may not like
you're<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.739> know<00:03:16.859> organic<00:03:17.340> chemistry<00:03:17.730> class

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you're you know organic chemistry class

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.270 
you're you know organic chemistry class
your<00:03:18.389> biology<00:03:18.629> class<00:03:19.049> right<00:03:19.319> now<00:03:19.349> but<00:03:19.859> make

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
your biology class right now but make

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.740 
your biology class right now but make
sure<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.579> learn<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> material<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.540> don't

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
sure you learn the material and don't

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
sure you learn the material and don't
just<00:03:21.930> memorize<00:03:22.139> it<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.739> promise<00:03:23.280> it'll

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
just memorize it and I promise it'll

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.339 
just memorize it and I promise it'll
make<00:03:23.639> studying<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.269> mcat<00:03:24.389> so<00:03:25.049> much

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
make studying for the mcat so much

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.699 
make studying for the mcat so much
easier<00:03:26.060> some<00:03:27.060> people<00:03:27.389> study<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:28.019> six<00:03:28.319> months

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
easier some people study for six months

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.009 
easier some people study for six months
some<00:03:28.859> people<00:03:29.129> study<00:03:29.400> for<00:03:29.699> a<00:03:29.730> month<00:03:30.030> before<00:03:30.269> it

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
some people study for a month before it

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.650 
some people study for a month before it
really<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.099> i<00:03:32.400> would<00:03:33.090> plan<00:03:33.299> on

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
really is up to you i would plan on

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.930 
really is up to you i would plan on
taking<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.230> test<00:03:34.530> twice<00:03:34.829> simply<00:03:35.459> because<00:03:35.579> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
taking the test twice simply because the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.199 
taking the test twice simply because the
first<00:03:36.209> time<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:37.290> do<00:03:37.530> see<00:03:38.370> what<00:03:38.519> it's<00:03:38.639> like<00:03:38.819> and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
first time you do see what it's like and

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.119 
first time you do see what it's like and
you<00:03:39.329> know<00:03:39.480> see<00:03:39.810> how<00:03:41.329> you<00:03:42.329> did<00:03:43.199> in<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.680> second

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
you know see how you did in the second

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.309 
you know see how you did in the second
time<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.609> can<00:03:44.819> you<00:03:45.150> know<00:03:45.209> look<00:03:45.690> at<00:03:45.810> your<00:03:45.989> score

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
time you can you know look at your score

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.319 
time you can you know look at your score
see<00:03:46.680> what<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.949> need<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.280> improve<00:03:47.400> upon<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
see what you need to improve upon and

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:53.119 
see what you need to improve upon and
then<00:03:49.459> do<00:03:50.459> better<00:03:50.699> on<00:03:51.000> your<00:03:51.510> second<00:03:51.959> one<00:03:52.139> but<00:03:52.859> um

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
then do better on your second one but um

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.280 
then do better on your second one but um
