sort<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.180> first<00:02:13.360> wing<00:02:13.660> which<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.140> mostly

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
sort of the first wing which is mostly

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.370 
sort of the first wing which is mostly
about<00:02:14.620> melting<00:02:15.130> down<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.400> ore<00:02:15.550> into<00:02:15.970> slag

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
about melting down the ore into slag

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.990 
about melting down the ore into slag
second<00:02:17.380> wing<00:02:17.500> where<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.310> molten<00:02:18.640> or<00:02:18.790> is

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
new rate structure it's gonna be

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.170 
new rate structure it's gonna be
something<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.579> just<00:03:30.700> Zone<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
something that you just Zone in the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.240 
something that you just Zone in the
front<00:03:31.450> door<00:03:31.659> for<00:03:31.900> instead<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.409> queuing<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:33.159> we

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
front door for instead of queuing but we

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.130 
front door for instead of queuing but we
want<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.459> preserve<00:03:33.610> some<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.150> freedom<00:03:34.390> so

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
want to preserve some of that freedom so

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.809 
want to preserve some of that freedom so
we<00:03:35.409> envision<00:03:35.829> some<00:03:35.980> things<00:03:36.220> such<00:03:36.459> as<00:03:36.489> maybe

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
we envision some things such as maybe

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.309 
we envision some things such as maybe
once<00:03:37.360> you've<00:03:37.510> cleared<00:03:37.750> all<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.019> wings<00:03:38.170> a

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
once you've cleared all the wings a

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.600 
once you've cleared all the wings a
certain<00:03:38.560> number<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.769> times<00:03:39.010> maybe<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.459> can

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
certain number of times maybe you can

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.309 
certain number of times maybe you can
for<00:03:39.849> Jackie<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.360> lets<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.599> directly<00:03:40.900> access

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
for Jackie that lets you directly access

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.960 
for Jackie that lets you directly access
the<00:03:41.349> crucible<00:03:41.829> later<00:03:42.069> on<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:42.640> your<00:03:42.819> raid

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
the crucible later on if your raid

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.460 
the crucible later on if your raid
leader<00:03:43.120> has<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.510> ability<00:03:43.599> so<00:03:44.290> if<00:03:44.349> you<00:03:44.410> don't

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
leader has that ability so if you don't

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.410 
leader has that ability so if you don't
necessarily<00:03:44.650> have<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.160> feel<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.640> it's<00:03:45.910> very

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
necessarily have to feel like it's very

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.940 
necessarily have to feel like it's very
clear<00:03:46.720> nine<00:03:46.989> bosses<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.680> get<00:03:47.799> to<00:03:47.829> the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
clear nine bosses just to get to the

clear nine bosses just to get to the
tenth<00:03:48.160> every<00:03:48.400> time<00:03:48.579> and<00:03:48.849> in<00:03:49.629> general<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.989> have
