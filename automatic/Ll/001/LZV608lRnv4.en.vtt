everyone this is Iggy and I am currently
testing<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.799> limits<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.549> infusion<00:00:06.000> altar

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
testing the limits of the infusion altar

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.080 
testing the limits of the infusion altar
and<00:00:06.919> where<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.189> play<00:00:08.309> stability<00:00:08.790> items

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
and where you can play stability items

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.290 
and where you can play stability items
there's<00:00:09.750> been<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> lot<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.110> confusion<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.950> to

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
doing thaumcraft 4.2 I believe so

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
count towards its stability so I'm gonna

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319

go<00:00:43.230> ahead<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.550> just<00:00:44.550> fire<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.030> thing<00:00:45.090> out

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
go ahead and just fire this thing out

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.060
