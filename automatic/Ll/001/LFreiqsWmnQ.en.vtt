00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
iphone 5 and yeah they basically did

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.190

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
to that actually was true now the casing

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.550 
to that actually was true now the casing
is<00:04:08.489> still<00:04:09.120> made<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.420> aluminum<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.319> does

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
is still made of aluminum and it does

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.220 
is still made of aluminum and it does
have<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.880> micro-sim<00:04:11.880> slot<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.510> suggests<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
have a micro-sim slot that suggests the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.520 
have a micro-sim slot that suggests the
device<00:04:13.980> uses<00:04:14.370> gsm<00:04:14.609> bands<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.109> could<00:04:16.380> be<00:04:16.410> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
device uses gsm bands or it could be a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.580 
device uses gsm bands or it could be a
global<00:04:16.910> cdma<00:04:17.910> phone<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.570> verizon<00:04:18.600> as<00:04:19.350> well

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
global cdma phone for verizon as well

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.420 
global cdma phone for verizon as well
and<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.140> see<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.740> difference<00:04:23.250> between

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
and you can see the difference between

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.220 
and you can see the difference between
the<00:04:24.240> cases

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
the cases

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.410 
the cases
and<00:04:25.350> they<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.920> like<00:04:26.160> an<00:04:26.340> extra<00:04:26.670> band<00:04:27.030> where

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
and they have like an extra band where

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.140 
and they have like an extra band where
the<00:04:27.620> headphones<00:04:28.620> would<00:04:28.920> go<00:04:29.130> with<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.670> mic<00:04:29.910> as

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
the headphones would go with the mic as

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.680 
the headphones would go with the mic as
well<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.760> difference<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.450> it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
well so that is the difference and it

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.480 
well so that is the difference and it
does<00:04:33.930> look<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.290> little<00:04:34.470> bit<00:04:34.680> thinner<00:04:34.920> than<00:04:35.250> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
does look a little bit thinner than the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.630 
does look a little bit thinner than the
iphone<00:04:36.030> 4<00:04:36.360> chasing<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:38.040> a<00:04:38.070> complete

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
iphone 4 chasing so that is a complete
