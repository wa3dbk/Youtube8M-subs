00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
from the pole and angled backwards so I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.050

particular<00:02:07.860> nets<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.729> environment<00:02:09.000> we

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
particular nets in this environment we

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.150 
particular nets in this environment we
typically<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.810> four<00:02:09.840> panels<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.770> two

typically have four panels up and two
panels<00:02:11.520> down<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.989> can<00:02:13.140> pull<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.530> loop

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
panels down and you can pull the loop

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
panels down and you can pull the loop
around<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:16.290> pole<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.630> want<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> take

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
around the pole and you want to take

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.449 
around the pole and you want to take
that<00:02:19.170> underneath<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> two<00:02:21.690> leading<00:02:21.930> lines

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
that underneath the two leading lines

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.780 
that underneath the two leading lines
now<00:02:23.459> at<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.700> point<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:26.040> knot<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.430> locked

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
now at this point the knot is locked

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.910 
now at this point the knot is locked
against<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> pole<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.990> one<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.590> beauties

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
against the pole and one of the beauties

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
against the pole and one of the beauties
of<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.220> knot<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.510> from<00:02:30.780> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
of this knot is is that from this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.990 
of this knot is is that from this
position<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.770> can<00:02:31.800> adjust<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> tension<00:02:32.670> by

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
position you can adjust the tension by

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.210 
position you can adjust the tension by
pulling<00:02:33.330> back<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.320> also<00:02:34.590> adjust<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
pulling back but you can also adjust the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.810 
pulling back but you can also adjust the
angle<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> net<00:02:35.940> by<00:02:36.570> pulling<00:02:36.959> one<00:02:37.350> way<00:02:37.820> or

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
angle of the net by pulling one way or

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.210 
angle of the net by pulling one way or
the<00:02:39.450> other<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:40.410> you're<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> hill<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.160> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
the other so if you're on a hill and you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.740 
the other so if you're on a hill and you
need<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.489> angle<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:42.000> net<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.480> certain

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
need to angle your net in a certain

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.510 
need to angle your net in a certain
direction<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.800> automatically<00:02:44.370> adjust

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
direction you can automatically adjust

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.790 
direction you can automatically adjust
the<00:02:44.970> angle<00:02:45.300> or<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.989> can<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.290> pull<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.500> taut

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
the angle or you can just pull it taut

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.860 
the angle or you can just pull it taut
and<00:02:47.070> make<00:02:47.520> sure<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.360> straight<00:02:48.690> with

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
and make sure that it's straight with

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.310 
and make sure that it's straight with
your<00:02:49.020> other<00:02:49.200> side<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.900> loop<00:02:52.110> end

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
your other side so you have the loop end

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.000 
your other side so you have the loop end
of<00:02:52.470> your<00:02:52.560> rope

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
of your rope

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.009 
of your rope
you're<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.459> pull<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.820> underneath<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
you're going to pull that underneath the

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.229 
you're going to pull that underneath the
leading<00:02:55.320> lines<00:02:55.560> that's<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> most<00:02:56.700> important

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
leading lines that's the most important

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.330 
leading lines that's the most important
part<00:02:57.450> at<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.410> point<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.890> adjust<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
part at this point you can adjust the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.910 
part at this point you can adjust the
tension<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.760> your<00:02:59.820> net<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.320> pull<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.560> on<00:03:01.860> your

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
tension of your net and pull up on your

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.100 
tension of your net and pull up on your
loop<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.850> that's<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.480> lock<00:03:03.660> you'll<00:03:03.870> notice

I'm<00:03:04.230> not<00:03:04.350> touching<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.739> pole<00:03:05.010> everything<00:03:05.940> is

I'm not touching the pole everything is

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.870 
I'm not touching the pole everything is

of<00:03:27.630> completing<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.230> lock<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.100> one<00:03:30.140> two<00:03:31.140> three

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910

have and at this point you can pull all
these<00:03:37.170> loops<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:37.739> tight<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.850> what<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:39.630> is

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
these loops up tight and what this is

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.170 
these loops up tight and what this is
doing<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.170> helping<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.829> lock<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.489> actually

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
doing is helping this lock to actually

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.110 
doing is helping this lock to actually
lock<00:03:42.420> tight<00:03:42.840> against<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.410> pole<00:03:43.910> at<00:03:44.910> this

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
lock tight against the pole at this

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.039 
lock tight against the pole at this
point<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:46.290> just<00:03:46.320> take<00:03:46.709> your<00:03:46.860> loose<00:03:47.100> loop<00:03:47.610> and

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
point you just take your loose loop and

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.660 
point you just take your loose loop and
tie<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.079> very<00:03:49.320> simple<00:03:49.709> knot<00:03:49.890> around<00:03:50.579> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
tie a very simple knot around the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.250 
tie a very simple knot around the
leading<00:03:50.970> lines<00:03:52.070> -<00:03:53.070> for<00:03:53.310> good<00:03:53.430> measure<00:03:54.260> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
leading lines - for good measure you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.890 
leading lines - for good measure you
should<00:03:55.440> have<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.620> little<00:03:55.799> bit<00:03:55.920> left<00:03:56.190> over<00:03:56.900> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
should have a little bit left over and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.259 
should have a little bit left over and
you<00:03:58.320> can<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.620> tie<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.860> at<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.070> back<00:03:59.269> so

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
you can just tie it at the back so

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.970 
you can just tie it at the back so
you've<00:04:00.420> brought<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.810> loop<00:04:00.989> under
