00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.240

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.970
 It was some things that I said to my boyfriend 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.290
 that I would like very much to have and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.110
 the hair disappeared from the web 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.470
 everything that the flight next to the page 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.900

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.720

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.430

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.379

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.360
 and with them has been presented with a 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.610
 dollar freshener that still smells of 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.910
 wonders that I would put my nose to the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.950
 bag because the bag where everything came 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.110
 dollar 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.880
 Then there was also a truck keychain 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.660

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.490
 that you see that when he asked for it he has 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.260
 said he wanted to put a m but he looks 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.570
 that the machine ignored him 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.070
 computer we do not live them disorderly 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.080

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.300
 they made us from their partner whatever 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.190
 and he went crazy and asked for an ele with 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.710

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.860

 that I said in the unboxing of Sweden 5 that 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.590

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.580
