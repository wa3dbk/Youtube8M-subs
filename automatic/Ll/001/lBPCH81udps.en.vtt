moving<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> similar<00:01:45.659> you're

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
moving is kind of similar you're

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
moving is kind of similar you're
familiar<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.070> cross-country<00:01:47.850> skiing<00:01:48.119> it's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
familiar with cross-country skiing it's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
familiar with cross-country skiing it's
a<00:01:48.930> similar<00:01:49.320> motion<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> my

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
a similar motion to that and that my

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.219 
a similar motion to that and that my
legs<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.729> moving<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:51.240> frontal<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.930> more

is neutral I'm again taking myself
through<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.149> beginning<00:02:00.149> warm-up<00:02:00.689> phase<00:02:00.899> which

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
through a beginning warm-up phase which

through a beginning warm-up phase which
will<00:02:01.560> last<00:02:01.799> five<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.460> 10<00:02:02.670> minutes<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.570> my<00:02:03.719> hands

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
will last five to 10 minutes so my hands

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.539 
will last five to 10 minutes so my hands
are<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> stay<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:04.740> are<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:05.250> not

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
are going to stay where they are I'm not

and<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.910> again<00:02:09.450> feeling<00:02:09.750> my<00:02:09.959> heart

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and I'm just again feeling my heart

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.520 
and I'm just again feeling my heart
starting<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.769> work<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.159> harder<00:02:12.530> blood

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
starting to work a little harder blood

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.949

my body throughout now as I get 3/4 of
the<00:02:18.689> way<00:02:18.810> through<00:02:18.840> my<00:02:19.140> warmup<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.799> to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the way through my warmup I'm going to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.319 
the way through my warmup I'm going to
move<00:02:19.980> my<00:02:20.189> hands<00:02:20.430> I'm<00:02:20.610> gonna<00:02:20.760> gently<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
arms are then again going in that cross

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.380 
arms are then again going in that cross
country<00:02:35.610> motion<00:02:36.859> of<00:02:37.859> being<00:02:38.790> propelled<00:02:39.209> in

front as my legs move back and forth and
this<00:02:42.810> again<00:02:43.109> is<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.440> ask<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.859> of<00:02:43.920> my

this again is going to ask more of my

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.369 
this again is going to ask more of my
body<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.879> my<00:02:45.000> heart<00:02:45.299> I'm<00:02:45.870> gonna<00:02:46.019> start<00:02:46.290> to

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
body more of my heart I'm gonna start to

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.680 
body more of my heart I'm gonna start to
feel<00:02:46.560> my<00:02:46.769> my<00:02:47.730> breaths<00:02:48.120> getting<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.540> little

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
feel my my breaths getting a little

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.160 
feel my my breaths getting a little
harder<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:50.810> circulation<00:02:51.810> improved

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
harder and circulation improved

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.129 
harder and circulation improved
throughout<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:52.590> body<00:02:53.389> I'm<00:02:54.389> nearing<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.959> end

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
throughout my body I'm nearing the end

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.780 
throughout my body I'm nearing the end
of<00:02:55.260> my<00:02:55.579> warmup

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
of my warmup

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
of my warmup
and<00:02:57.239> I'm<00:02:57.389> gonna<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.810> here<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.829> this<00:02:59.010> machine

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
and I'm gonna then here on this machine

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.119 
and I'm gonna then here on this machine
you're<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.359> more<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.659> control<00:03:00.840> than<00:03:01.290> say

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
you're really more in control than say

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.670 
you're really more in control than say
on<00:03:02.280> any<00:03:02.459> other<00:03:02.730> other<00:03:02.819> treadmill<00:03:03.329> for<00:03:04.290> example

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
on any other other treadmill for example

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.890 
on any other other treadmill for example
in<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.190> gonna<00:03:05.519> really<00:03:05.790> determine<00:03:06.359> when

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
in that I'm gonna really determine when

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.670 
in that I'm gonna really determine when
my<00:03:07.049> pace<00:03:07.319> increases<00:03:08.329> which<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.540> gonna<00:03:10.530> be

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
my pace increases which is gonna be

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.349 
my pace increases which is gonna be
right<00:03:10.859> about<00:03:11.099> now<00:03:11.280> for<00:03:11.340> me<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.209> I've<00:03:12.329> just

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
right about now for me so I've just

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.970 
right about now for me so I've just
finished<00:03:12.629> my<00:03:12.959> warmup<00:03:13.349> I'm<00:03:13.530> going<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.739> increase

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
finished my warmup I'm going to increase

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.369 
finished my warmup I'm going to increase
my<00:03:14.069> pace<00:03:14.459> by<00:03:15.180> physically<00:03:15.720> moving<00:03:16.049> my<00:03:16.139> feet

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
my pace by physically moving my feet

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.250 
my pace by physically moving my feet
faster<00:03:16.949> now<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.060> move<00:03:18.239> my<00:03:18.419> feet<00:03:18.660> faster<00:03:19.109> you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
faster now as I move my feet faster you

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.530 
faster now as I move my feet faster you
notice<00:03:19.590> one<00:03:20.069> thing<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.849> my<00:03:21.030> hands<00:03:21.209> have<00:03:21.419> to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
notice one thing that my hands have to

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.780 
notice one thing that my hands have to
move<00:03:21.690> faster<00:03:22.109> as<00:03:22.199> well<00:03:22.410> if<00:03:22.680> I'm<00:03:23.280> holding<00:03:23.519> these

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
move faster as well if I'm holding these

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.390 
move faster as well if I'm holding these
movable<00:03:24.269> arm<00:03:24.449> attachments<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.199> my<00:03:25.709> arms

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
movable arm attachments and my arms

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.189 
movable arm attachments and my arms
can't<00:03:26.639> catch<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.150> I'm<00:03:27.329> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.750> thrown

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
can't catch up I'm going to be thrown

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.569 
can't catch up I'm going to be thrown
off<00:03:28.379> balance<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.519> could<00:03:29.849> toss<00:03:30.090> or<00:03:30.359> tumble<00:03:31.579> so

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
off balance and could toss or tumble so

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.369 
off balance and could toss or tumble so
we<00:03:32.790> again<00:03:33.060> want<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.419> have<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> body<00:03:33.840> moving<00:03:34.139> in

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
we again want to have the body moving in

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.759 
we again want to have the body moving in
unison<00:03:35.449> now<00:03:36.449> as<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:36.720> see<00:03:36.900> here<00:03:37.169> my<00:03:37.319> strides<00:03:37.650> per

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
unison now as I see here my strides per

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.990 
unison now as I see here my strides per
minute<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.430> increased<00:03:39.379> and<00:03:40.819> this<00:03:41.819> is<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
minute have increased and this is a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.939 
minute have increased and this is a
little<00:03:42.299> more<00:03:42.389> challenging<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:42.930> me<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.769> this

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
little more challenging for me so this

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.490 
little more challenging for me so this
would<00:03:44.160> be<00:03:44.389> in<00:03:45.389> comparison<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.260> treadmill

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
would be in comparison to the treadmill

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.580 
would be in comparison to the treadmill
my<00:03:47.190> moderate<00:03:47.609> jog<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:51.030> feels<00:03:51.329> again<00:03:52.230> very

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
my moderate jog this feels again very

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.780 
my moderate jog this feels again very
good<00:03:52.919> I'm<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.500> excited<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.859> my<00:03:56.099> body

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
good I'm really excited to have my body

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.259 
good I'm really excited to have my body
working<00:03:57.269> harder<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:58.199> really<00:03:58.500> getting<00:03:59.269> amped

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
working harder and really getting amped

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.000 
working harder and really getting amped
up<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.540> get<00:04:00.659> into<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> bulk<00:04:01.139> of<00:04:01.230> my<00:04:01.319> program<00:04:01.799> so

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
up to get into the bulk of my program so

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.409 
up to get into the bulk of my program so
here<00:04:05.010> again<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:05.549> machine<00:04:05.760> my<00:04:06.060> legs<00:04:06.299> are

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
here again on this machine my legs are

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.119 
here again on this machine my legs are
going<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.599> start<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.900> move<00:04:07.019> even<00:04:07.349> faster<00:04:07.590> and

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
going to start to move even faster and

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.789 
going to start to move even faster and
I'm<00:04:08.729> going<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:09.000> here<00:04:09.479> utilize<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.260> resistance

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
I'm going to here utilize the resistance

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.800 
I'm going to here utilize the resistance
which<00:04:11.519> will<00:04:11.729> not<00:04:11.940> physically<00:04:12.449> raise<00:04:12.629> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
which will not physically raise the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.839 
which will not physically raise the
machine<00:04:13.139> but<00:04:13.859> just<00:04:14.069> make<00:04:14.220> these<00:04:14.370> pedals<00:04:14.790> a

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
machine but just make these pedals a

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.849 
machine but just make these pedals a
little<00:04:15.060> harder<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.479> move<00:04:15.629> so<00:04:16.470> I'm<00:04:16.530> taking<00:04:16.680> my

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
little harder to move so I'm taking my

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.800 
little harder to move so I'm taking my
hand<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.639> gonna<00:04:17.789> take<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.180> resistance<00:04:18.630> up

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
hand I'm gonna take that resistance up

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.270 
hand I'm gonna take that resistance up
and<00:04:19.079> as<00:04:19.289> you<00:04:19.409> see<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> start<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.039> hit<00:04:20.159> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and as you see I start to hit the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.920 
and as you see I start to hit the
resistance<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.239> numbers<00:04:21.599> here<00:04:21.810> go<00:04:21.989> up

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
resistance the numbers here go up

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.290 
resistance the numbers here go up
I'm<00:04:23.830> gonna<00:04:23.949> take<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.340> all<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.520> way<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.699> a<00:04:24.850> 15

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
I'm gonna take that all the way to a 15

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.900 
I'm gonna take that all the way to a 15
and<00:04:25.509> then<00:04:25.810> really<00:04:26.259> push<00:04:26.500> hard<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:27.639> drive

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
and then really push hard and drive

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.629 
and then really push hard and drive
through<00:04:28.210> this<00:04:28.330> machine<00:04:29.039> it<00:04:30.039> feels<00:04:30.280> really

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
through this machine it feels really

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.159 
through this machine it feels really
good

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
good

the bulk of my cardio here on the
elliptical<00:05:00.729> trainer<00:05:01.139> I'm<00:05:02.139> going<00:05:02.259> to<00:05:02.320> slow

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
elliptical trainer I'm going to slow

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.450 
elliptical trainer I'm going to slow
things<00:05:02.710> down<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:03.009> bit

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
things down a bit

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.540 
things down a bit
take<00:05:04.000> my<00:05:04.180> resistance<00:05:04.449> all<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.169> way<00:05:05.289> down<00:05:05.550> to

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
take my resistance all the way down to

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.800 
take my resistance all the way down to
a4<00:05:07.320> which<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.470> next<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.830> nothing<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:10.690> I'm

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
a4 which is next to nothing and I'm

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.529 
a4 which is next to nothing and I'm
going<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:11.020> slow<00:05:11.169> my<00:05:11.320> pace<00:05:11.560> down<00:05:11.940> which<00:05:12.940> again

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
going to slow my pace down which again

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.140 
going to slow my pace down which again
is<00:05:13.690> going<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.870> bring<00:05:14.050> my<00:05:14.199> heart<00:05:14.470> rate<00:05:14.650> down

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
is going to bring my heart rate down

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.870 
is going to bring my heart rate down
it's<00:05:16.150> also<00:05:16.479> tell<00:05:16.690> my<00:05:16.810> body<00:05:17.400> it's<00:05:18.400> time<00:05:18.669> to

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
it's also tell my body it's time to

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.290 
it's also tell my body it's time to
start<00:05:19.210> slowing<00:05:19.509> things<00:05:19.750> down<00:05:20.910> this<00:05:21.910> might<00:05:22.150> be

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
start slowing things down this might be

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.420 
start slowing things down this might be
a<00:05:22.330> good<00:05:22.539> time<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.990> go<00:05:23.470> ahead<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.740> take<00:05:24.310> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
a good time to go ahead and take the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.790 
a good time to go ahead and take the
hands<00:05:24.610> in<00:05:24.759> the<00:05:24.789> center<00:05:25.000> slowly<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:25.750> read<00:05:26.650> your

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
hands in the center slowly and read your

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.920 
hands in the center slowly and read your
heart<00:05:27.010> rate<00:05:27.190> which<00:05:28.150> is<00:05:28.300> in<00:05:28.419> front<00:05:28.630> of<00:05:28.720> me<00:05:28.840> and

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
heart rate which is in front of me and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.960 
heart rate which is in front of me and
in<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.110> center<00:05:29.380> of<00:05:29.470> the<00:05:29.530> machine<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.550> as<00:05:30.789> my

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
in the center of the machine and as my

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.050 
in the center of the machine and as my
heart<00:05:31.210> rates<00:05:31.360> at<00:05:31.539> 145<00:05:32.289> that<00:05:32.740> tells<00:05:33.010> me<00:05:33.190> I<00:05:33.370> need

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
heart rates at 145 that tells me I need

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.850 
heart rates at 145 that tells me I need
to<00:05:34.090> spend<00:05:34.360> some<00:05:34.539> more<00:05:34.659> time<00:05:34.720> on<00:05:35.169> my<00:05:35.229> cooldown

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
to spend some more time on my cooldown

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.279 
to spend some more time on my cooldown
and<00:05:36.550> let<00:05:36.880> my<00:05:37.000> heart<00:05:37.210> rate<00:05:37.360> calm<00:05:37.570> down<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:37.810> bit

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
and let my heart rate calm down a bit

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.800 
and let my heart rate calm down a bit
so<00:05:39.010> I'm<00:05:39.070> gonna<00:05:39.190> slow<00:05:39.460> my<00:05:39.639> legs<00:05:39.880> even<00:05:40.539> further

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
so I'm gonna slow my legs even further

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
and you'll see my heart rate dropping as

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.710 
and you'll see my heart rate dropping as
we<00:05:47.260> speak<00:05:47.590> and<00:05:48.400> again<00:05:48.970> I<00:05:49.000> think<00:05:49.270> I<00:05:49.330> mentioned

be like a hill and not an extreme peak
or<00:05:57.280> mountain<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.419> we're<00:05:58.599> slowly<00:05:58.960> taking<00:05:59.530> the

or mountain so we're slowly taking the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.610 
or mountain so we're slowly taking the
body<00:05:59.800> up<00:06:00.009> to<00:06:00.060> its<00:06:01.060> exercise<00:06:01.449> climax<00:06:02.229> or<00:06:02.380> peak

body up to its exercise climax or peak

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.300 
body up to its exercise climax or peak
and<00:06:02.889> then<00:06:03.490> slowly<00:06:03.880> going<00:06:04.360> back<00:06:04.599> down<00:06:04.840> that

that uh hill and everything again is
controlled<00:06:12.449> comfortable<00:06:13.449> and<00:06:13.800> moderate<00:06:14.800> but

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
controlled comfortable and moderate but

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.839 
controlled comfortable and moderate but
we're<00:06:15.220> getting<00:06:15.460> a<00:06:15.550> really<00:06:15.820> good<00:06:16.000> workout<00:06:17.849> let

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
we're getting a really good workout let

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.330 
we're getting a really good workout let
me<00:06:18.970> read<00:06:19.150> my<00:06:19.270> heart<00:06:19.479> rate<00:06:19.630> again<00:06:19.750> and<00:06:20.340> that's

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
me read my heart rate again and that's

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.999 
me read my heart rate again and that's
dropped<00:06:21.669> to<00:06:21.789> 120<00:06:22.360> and<00:06:22.690> as<00:06:23.380> I<00:06:23.530> stopped<00:06:23.770> talking

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009 
dropped to 120 and as I stopped talking

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.180 
dropped to 120 and as I stopped talking
even<00:06:24.340> you<00:06:24.639> can<00:06:24.789> even<00:06:25.000> see<00:06:25.180> how<00:06:25.330> talking<00:06:26.190> could

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
even you can even see how talking could

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.830 
even you can even see how talking could
be<00:06:27.340> considered<00:06:27.729> an<00:06:27.880> activity<00:06:28.389> because<00:06:28.690> that

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
be considered an activity because that

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.089 
be considered an activity because that
will<00:06:28.990> vary<00:06:29.229> my<00:06:29.409> heart<00:06:29.620> rate<00:06:29.830> because<00:06:30.009> that

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
will vary my heart rate because that

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.560 
will vary my heart rate because that
requires<00:06:30.340> more<00:06:30.849> of<00:06:30.969> my<00:06:31.090> body

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
requires more of my body

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.560 
requires more of my body
I'm<00:06:32.139> gonna<00:06:32.289> quit<00:06:32.469> keep<00:06:32.770> quiet<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:34.330> we'll<00:06:34.450> see

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
I'm gonna quit keep quiet and we'll see

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:46.179 
I'm gonna quit keep quiet and we'll see
that<00:06:34.719> my<00:06:34.840> heart<00:06:35.020> rate<00:06:35.080> lowers<00:06:35.529> even<00:06:35.800> more

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:46.189 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.799

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:48.809 
and now that I've gone into the 115

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.510 
and now that I've gone into the 115
range<00:06:49.050> which<00:06:49.589> is<00:06:49.740> where<00:06:49.889> I<00:06:49.919> needed<00:06:50.159> to<00:06:50.249> be<00:06:50.339> I'm

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
range which is where I needed to be I'm

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.189 
range which is where I needed to be I'm
going<00:06:50.669> to<00:06:50.759> go<00:06:50.849> ahead<00:06:51.059> and<00:06:51.179> slowly<00:06:51.569> stop<00:06:52.020> and
