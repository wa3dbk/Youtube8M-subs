00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
deep corner thing like a so until you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.280 
deep corner thing like a so until you
have<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> triangle<00:02:18.830> yeah<00:02:19.630> go<00:02:20.630> from<00:02:20.810> your<00:02:20.960> folded

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
have a triangle yeah go from your folded

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.240 
have a triangle yeah go from your folded
triangle<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:22.330> Diamond<00:02:23.330> man<00:02:24.070> really<00:02:25.070> should

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
triangle to Diamond man really should

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.950 
triangle to Diamond man really should
remember<00:02:25.460> shapes<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.600> you're<00:02:26.720> going<00:02:26.840> to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
remember shapes and then you're going to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.740 
remember shapes and then you're going to
tuck<00:02:27.230> your<00:02:27.410> little<00:02:27.530> extra<00:02:28.190> flap<00:02:28.459> ease<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.790> so

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
tuck your little extra flap ease in so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.420 
tuck your little extra flap ease in so
that<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.230> nice<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.470> flat<00:02:30.770> when<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.400> a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
that it is nice and flat when you have a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.530 
that it is nice and flat when you have a
nice<00:02:31.730> little<00:02:32.590> diamond<00:02:33.590> shape<00:02:34.450> next<00:02:35.450> you're

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
nice little diamond shape next you're

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.330 
nice little diamond shape next you're
going<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.690> take<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.080> open<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.800> mouth<00:02:36.980> part

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
going to take the open in the mouth part

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.520 
going to take the open in the mouth part
and<00:02:37.640> fold<00:02:38.270> down<00:02:38.450> each<00:02:38.720> top<00:02:38.990> corner<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
and fold down each top corner to the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.400 
and fold down each top corner to the
bottom<00:02:39.830> corner<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.900> get<00:02:42.050> another

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
bottom corner so you get another

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.520 
bottom corner so you get another
triangle<00:02:43.150> fold<00:02:44.150> one<00:02:44.390> side<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:44.840> side<00:02:45.050> yeah

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
triangle fold one side to one side yeah

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.320 
triangle fold one side to one side yeah
side<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.130> other<00:02:48.880> now<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.120> another

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
side to the other now you have another

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.570 
side to the other now you have another
triangle<00:02:50.690> shape<00:02:51.620> with<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:51.950> opening<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.550> the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
triangle shape with it opening on the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.790 
triangle shape with it opening on the
bottom<00:02:53.030> I'm<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.989> take<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.380> opening<00:02:54.709> on

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
bottom I'm going to take that opening on

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.960 
bottom I'm going to take that opening on
the<00:02:54.830> bottom<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.280> do<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> same<00:02:55.580> thing<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.880> did

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
the bottom and do the same thing you did

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.720 
the bottom and do the same thing you did
earlier<00:02:56.120> make<00:02:56.540> another<00:02:56.780> diamond<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.730> then

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
earlier make another diamond and then

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670 
earlier make another diamond and then
here's<00:02:58.970> where<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.209> magic<00:02:59.300> happens<00:02:59.870> you<00:03:00.530> see

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
here's where the magic happens you see

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.960 
here's where the magic happens you see
how<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.890> have<00:03:00.980> these<00:03:01.160> two<00:03:01.340> flaps<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.790> like

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
how you have these two flaps that like

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.970 
how you have these two flaps that like
overlap<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.660> top<00:03:02.840> we're<00:03:03.440> going<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.739> pinch

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
overlap on the top we're going to pinch

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.729 
overlap on the top we're going to pinch
those<00:03:04.190> corners<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.880> pull<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.900> out<00:03:06.140> ever<00:03:06.470> so

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
those corners and pull it out ever so

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.520 
those corners and pull it out ever so
slowly<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:07.430> you're<00:03:08.299> going<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.630> organize

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
slowly and then you're going to organize

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.830 
slowly and then you're going to organize
this<00:03:10.100> bits<00:03:10.400> in<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.640> middle<00:03:10.940> by<00:03:11.420> pushing<00:03:11.690> down

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
this bits in the middle by pushing down

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.380 
this bits in the middle by pushing down
and<00:03:12.320> making<00:03:12.500> that<00:03:12.799> nice<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.090> flat<00:03:14.299> even<00:03:16.390> like

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
and making that nice and flat even like

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.800 
and making that nice and flat even like
so<00:03:18.730> anyway<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.000> then<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.269> have<00:03:20.420> your<00:03:20.450> little

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
so anyway and then you have your little

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.390 
so anyway and then you have your little
boats<00:03:21.110> with<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.560> little<00:03:21.769> topper<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
boats with this little topper in the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.830 
boats with this little topper in the
middle<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.560> that's<00:03:27.799> how<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.070> make<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.850> little

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
middle and that's how you make a little

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.860 
middle and that's how you make a little
bit<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:29.989> oats<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.700> not<00:03:32.660> waterproof

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
bit of oats and this is not waterproof

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.420 
bit of oats and this is not waterproof
unfortunately<00:03:33.739> if<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:33.980> made<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.160> out<00:03:34.340> of

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
unfortunately if you made it out of

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.699 
unfortunately if you made it out of
something<00:03:34.610> waterproof<00:03:34.910> then<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.330> probably

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
something waterproof then it probably

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.259 
something waterproof then it probably
float<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:37.220> considerable<00:03:37.700> amount<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:37.940> time<00:03:38.000> at

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
float for considerable amount of time at

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.949 
float for considerable amount of time at
the<00:03:38.630> moment<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.049> does<00:03:39.170> not<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:40.730> yes<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.180> is

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
the moment it does not but yes that is

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.140 
the moment it does not but yes that is
how<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.110> make<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.380> boat<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:43.489> was<00:03:43.640> inspired<00:03:43.850> by

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
how you make a boat this was inspired by

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.890 
how you make a boat this was inspired by
an<00:03:44.390> episode<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.780> lamb<00:03:45.769> chops<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.190> watched<00:03:46.400> like
