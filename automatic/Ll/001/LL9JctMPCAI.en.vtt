fit<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.270> can<00:02:44.390> actually<00:02:44.540> get<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.990> made

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
I think if you work in production and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.730 
I think if you work in production and
and<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> want<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.510> talk<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.930> producers<00:02:58.440> this

and you want to talk to producers this

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.680 
and you want to talk to producers this

amazing speakers people on the panel I

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.490

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
think it has really become something

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.040 
think it has really become something
that<00:03:11.280> people<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:11.910> over<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.480> industry<00:03:12.960> and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
that people all over the industry and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.630 
that people all over the industry and
outside<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> industry<00:03:13.740> look<00:03:14.160> forward<00:03:14.490> to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.950 

I<00:03:23.140> can't<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.490> better<00:03:24.520> way<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.720> get

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
I can't think of a better way to get

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.170 
I can't think of a better way to get
producers<00:03:26.710> together<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.370> help<00:03:27.640> improve
