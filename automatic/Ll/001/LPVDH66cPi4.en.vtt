00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
case if one of the sides is broken we

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:00.450 
case if one of the sides is broken we
also<00:00:58.449> have<00:00:58.900> to<00:00:59.080> replace<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.650> with<00:00:59.799> a<00:00:59.949> new<00:01:00.250> one

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
also have to replace it with a new one

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.880 
also have to replace it with a new one
as<00:01:00.640> it<00:01:01.089> might<00:01:01.330> affect<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.930> operation<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.710> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.400 

we<00:03:03.010> need<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.520> check<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:04.360> piston<00:03:04.960> pin<00:03:05.200> is

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
we need to check if this piston pin is

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.620 
we need to check if this piston pin is
worn<00:03:05.950> out<00:03:06.250> or<00:03:06.460> not

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630
