00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:12.210
 what they do this is the indices 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.299
 heat pump dryer 3 Dec 1845 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.300
 4x and why this heat pump dryer 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.010
 because you namely about 85 euros per 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 year compared to one 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.300
 condenser dryer 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 the specifications of these indices 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.740
 heat pump dryer has energy rating a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.500
 plus out and dry capacity from one to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.949
 and with 7 has half a kilo and beyond 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.100
 he 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.660
 automatic sensors the special eco 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.890
 programs and he has 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.890
 delayed start time 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.510
 why a heat pump dryer heat pump 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.550
 dryers actually just a normal dryer 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.649
 then a little smarter he reuse 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.839
 namely warm air and therefore 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.559
 you save extremely much on you 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.660
 energy bill 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.850
 well how much do you actually save that 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.579
 calculated on the basis of five 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.260
 drying a normal 7 a week 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.690
 half a kilo dryer compared to this one 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.420
 idea c 8454 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.320
 the normal in the see dryer consumption per 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.340
 dry 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.640
 3.9 7 kilowatt times 22 euro cents that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.149
 namely, a kilowatt is 87 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.229
 eurocent times 5 times a week times 52 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:26.350
 so a normal use in the dryer 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.170
 226 euros 20 and this heat pump dryer 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.039
 consumption per drying 2.48 kilowatts 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.270
 but 0.22 eurocents is 4 and 50 eurocents 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.450
 per drying 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.819
 times 5 clinic times 52 as once a year 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.310
 is 140 euros 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.490
 40 after these amounts 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.739
 This means a yearly saving of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.509
 85 euros and 80 cents on the energy bill 

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:52.440
 compared to an ordinary one 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.440
 condenser dryer 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.649
 This heat pump dryers are a smart one 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.880
 boy is in fact all sensors 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.439
 the dryer 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.719
 without people opting for cupboard dry 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.000
 does anyone really go through exactly 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.770
 therefore never dry too much and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.379
 That way you never have much energy from you 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 the operation is fairly simple from this 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.140
 heat pump dryer the numbers 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.750
 namely correspond with that 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 program you choose after an is eco 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.910
 cotton 2 is eco shirts and three is eco 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.860
 synthetic 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.019
 one through three are really energy 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.730
 saver programs, but that is being 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.130
 smaller laundry is good she wants to be dry 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.220
 namely up to and including 1 kilo 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.540
 4 to 7 are the drying programs 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.310
 for cotton 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.380
 you see there is so extra dry us 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.190
 namely immediately ready to wear 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.069
 5 is cupboard dry and 6 is hanger dry and 7 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.079
 is iron dry then be 8 to 11 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.140
 the special programs 8 is for the 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.510
 synthetic fabrics to dry 9 the fine 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.209
 was either for delicate fabrics such as 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.180
 for example the lingerie and she is 10 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.579
 to dry the mole and 11 for the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.799
 you have 12 to 14 th 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.209
 sports programs 12 is specially for 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.760
 sneakers 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.950
 call him buying for a while and then you get 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.220
 also included the rail pull pick it up 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.680
 filter and live out are this way 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.200
 the filter will be put back in again 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.900
 and then you can put your sneakers here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.150
 in dry then 13 is the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.590
 sportswear and 14 is for dry for the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.450
 car work clothes to it all 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.190
 special fabrics 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.590
 and must be dried separately afterwards 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.190
 the 14 drying programs still have one here 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.530
 the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.480
 iron you as a loose button 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.299
 program also only takes 10 minutes 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.920
 so that it is just as easy when ironing 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.660
 then we also have it in writing 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.760
 Programs, for example the one 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.650
 blouse in the pub which briefly 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.420
 remove odors for example also 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.859
 for winter clothes if you take that out of the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.859
 cupboard to freshen up 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.249
 all programs are doing optimally 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.499
 set with you of course your own 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:59.480
 preference then that is still possible 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:02.120
 for example, you can also leave it on time 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.560
 and you want to dry with a higher one 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.150
 allow the temperature to dry 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.250
 then you can always with this function 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.530
 he also has a delay start 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.170
 so you can determine when this 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.510
 heat dryer and that is until well 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.859
 twenty-four hours so you use the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.930
 delay start 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.000
 and then he goes only after 5 hours goes in this 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.739
 case but yes you have your laundry 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.590
 good in it then it goes the kitchen 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.960
 because it is here that have shut 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.660
 will change for a moment before he 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.949
 starts with dry and this function yes yes 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.320
 we already guess it 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.930
 then he keeps moving him until 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.289
 you get it out as little as possible 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.849
 smells 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.070
 if you want to know when this one 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.840
 dry there is done with dry then 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.910
 We use this button because then the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.470
 namely the beeping and then you know that 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.270
 you are completely finished then top left 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.889
 sit and load the condensation that can 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.300
 of course completely out and that is possible 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.849
 your empty one 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.979
 but easier is through this hose 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.509
 so that he is not in the 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.520
 comments drawer ends up in the drain 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.570
 you never have to do the condensation again 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.370
 drawer 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.840
 this dry shrimp was allowed next to the 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.039
 washing machine but the washing machine 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.320
 is on that side 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.300
 you can open the door you can on the other 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.009
 side places and so very handy 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.840
 because then of course it opens like that 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.550
 easy way was good in the dryer 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.320
 to stop for maintenance 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.509
 every time the fluff filter 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.639
 nice clean because that way 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.449
 does it continue to function well then one 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.909
 maintenance tip 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:30.349
 from washer.nl than at the capacitor 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:34.610
 take this filter out and that 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:37.389
 of course also a so nice clean 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.469
 at least keep this boy optimal 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.419
 achieve 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.880
 do this filter well every month 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.800
 cleaning so that this heat pump dryer 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.449
 remains really economical 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.400
 and then of course not forget the 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.310
 accessories and for being dryer 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.360
 The dryer balls condensate drain kit the 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.650
 air exhaust hose 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.780
 in front of 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.919
 air dryer the condensation over hoses 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.009
 so that you no longer have to use the water basin 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.110
 empty it and put it on the washing machine 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:06.000
 then of course it was very handy 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.000
 adapter with or without drawer
