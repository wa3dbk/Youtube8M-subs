00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.680
 online shopping cart me again 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.719
 Today I want to show you the battery test 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.420
 using the antutu tester program 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.519
 which tests the battery on 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.590
 working hours today before 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.869
 you are not smartphones and tablets 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.180
 the three most popular most 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.820
 popular models at the moment 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 in my opinion and so on from left to right 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 us pipo m9 cube u30gt 2 and on our right 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 ainol spark 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.559
 battery performance by war 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.170
 spark the largest battery 10,000 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.559
 milliamper hours at the cube 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.140
 battery we have 3 2 battery 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 him inside for 36 600 totaling 7 200 and 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.149
 pipo m9 has a battery 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 size is more accurate with a capacity of 7,800 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.780
 milliampere hours by performance 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.670
 screen is the best screen highest 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.210
 permission from Ainola sparco 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.830
 1920 full hd to 1080 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.260
 the cube has 30 gt2 ainol spark 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.560
 retina resolution 2,500 for 1,500 than that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.590
 The simplest resolution for pipo m9 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.229
 that's 1280 by 800 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.600
 so let's see and by the way and the process 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.540
 the processor the processor we have here in these 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.210
 two models of pipo m9 cube u30gt 2 with us 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.610
 rockchip 3188 quad can 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.930
 most powerful processor 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 whether we have a war allwinner a31 processor 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.570
 also quad but the frequency 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 much lower so let's see who have 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.500
 we have the longest run or less 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.240
 only in third place we got 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.229
 cube u30gt 2 tablet and its indicator 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.659
 amounted to 600 5 points remind who who 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.810
 did not watch my previous test reviews 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.159
 smartphones these points mean that here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.429
 this ball divided by 3 we get minus 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.050
 you for which the program was able to discharge 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:14.110
 This model from 100 percent to 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.310
 approximately 15 19 and 20 as it sees fit 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.830
 the program is testing the program with such 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.269
 what kind of processor is the screen 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.000
 what is the processor load 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.400
 the maximum and gives here such a ball 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 there is this model we have shown the third 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.099
 result 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.640
 605 points in second place with us 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:40.470
 turned out to be the most capacious in performance 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.150
 tablet and showed us 658 points 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.700
 there is no significant difference with the cube 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.860
 but just as a fact this model 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.180
 works longer despite its greater 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.470
 permission well here probably affected 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.910
 huge battery of 10,000 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.890
 milliampere hours 658 points and the first 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.349
 pipo m9 takes place 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.359
 even when they conduct tests it was 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.630
 It is noted that this model is different 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.720
 really increased work time 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.049
 from the battery and so we see 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.459
 that this model scored 728 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:22.440
 points which is 150 by 130 points approximately 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:26.049
 more than its competitor cube u30gt 2 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.989
 In principle, I just wanted to show 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.329
 battery operation like a lot of us 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.799
 questions are asked by our clients about 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.819
 which tablet will work 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:40.060
 most of all here pipo m9 are the most 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:46.120
 autonomous principle still wanted to say 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:49.329
 that here is this beam 605 at cube 658 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.819
 but my good ball is a great ball 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.090
 in which thanks to which 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.880
 tablets will work their declared 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.370
 five to six hours in video mode and 3-4 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.980
 hours in the game mode that is, it is quite 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.930
 good result but also for all these 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.510
 pipo m9 models will work 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.870
 as long as possible thank you for your attention 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.870
 all the best
