00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
home and just after I pushed it off the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.150 
home and just after I pushed it off the
trailer<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:37.050> wrecker<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.740> real<00:01:37.920> tough

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
trailer the wrecker was in real tough

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.880 
trailer the wrecker was in real tough
shape<00:01:38.430> when<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.760> got<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.290> proceeded<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
shape when we got it but we proceeded to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.240 
shape when we got it but we proceeded to
build<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.250> into<00:01:41.430> an<00:01:41.610> off-road<00:01:42.000> recovery<00:01:42.510> drum

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
build it into an off-road recovery drum

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.010 
build it into an off-road recovery drum
as<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.550> was<00:01:44.729> rebuilding<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> wrecker<00:01:45.630> I'm

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
as I was rebuilding the wrecker I'm

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
as I was rebuilding the wrecker I'm
modifying<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.830> for<00:01:46.860> off-road<00:01:47.429> use<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.000> had<00:01:48.570> my

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
modifying it for off-road use I had my

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.650 
modifying it for off-road use I had my
suspicions<00:01:49.470> about<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.979> frame<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:51.390> had

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
suspicions about the frame it had

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.900 
suspicions about the frame it had
reinforcements<00:01:52.560> welded<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
reinforcements welded on it but the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.050 
reinforcements welded on it but the
welds<00:01:54.240> looked<00:01:54.570> how<00:01:54.780> should<00:01:55.050> we<00:01:55.140> say<00:01:55.380> less<00:01:56.009> than

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
welds looked how should we say less than

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.570 
welds looked how should we say less than
professional<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.830> if<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.950> look<00:01:59.130> at<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> in

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
professional and if you look at it in

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.609 
professional and if you look at it in
this<00:01:59.729> picture<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.450> looks<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.350> may<00:02:01.500> have

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
this picture it looks like it may have

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.270 
this picture it looks like it may have
been<00:02:01.770> bent<00:02:02.570> I'm<00:02:03.570> actually<00:02:03.869> surprised<00:02:04.830> that<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
been bent I'm actually surprised that it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.029 
been bent I'm actually surprised that it
held<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:05.850> long<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> did<00:02:06.619> I'm<00:02:07.619> sorry<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
