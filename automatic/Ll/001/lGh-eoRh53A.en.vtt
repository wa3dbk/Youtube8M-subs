00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.799
 so should welcome to one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.440
 new video from me today i will be one 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.240
 a little bit about maybe new ones 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.760
 perks in the coque two talk and before 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.880
 few days ago or so or weeks ago he 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.439
 said yes, the world is the pc case 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.559
 surfaced found at tom bmx and yes 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.239
 there are outlook on 1 things in it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 how far gone digital wonder weapon then 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.989
 multiplayer drown something and now 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 also of course works 299 floor and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.149
 you have to say it's not just 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.850
 because it's in there right now 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.370
 game transfer but have the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
 just experimented with what happened 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.780
 would do well in the game and have 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.969
 Just tried everything and yes so 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.799
 that does not mean if I say that now 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.340
 that that really comes because just 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.619
 again possibilities and yes I start 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.140
 do it now with the first one 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.110
 work that is damage i will give it to you 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.390
 also show the same 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:24.240
 and yes you can see high pointed 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.250
 bullet or what and when two 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.610
 next to it and that reminds one 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.680
 a little anja gadow 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.079
 and yes it is another me 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 guess what it brings is when you get it 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.670
 maybe a bit stronger than jana 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.189
 or you can ask a good question you can 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.970
 Maybe you can take more 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.220
 plug in more or so or yes from 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.430
 many hordes are attacked by only 1 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.950
 1 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.170
 a white I'm really a today 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.760
 bit planned if you take a bump 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.530
 get that one that you would be 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.040
 gets a bump if so a whole 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.560
 horde is getting on you and that's exactly what 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.560
 was the first work the second one is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.740
 commutes a candle light cola or something 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.740
 you will also be shown immediately 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.480
 So you see, you can see that 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.090
 should not be potatoes because of me 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.310
 should thought it would be potatoes 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.280
 Grenades represent each other 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.670
 are linked and what I like first 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.370
 it has come to mind that one 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.700
 maybe take more grenades with you 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.290
 may or may be a bit nonsensical 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.810
 is because you have the controller 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.830
 yes anyway so busy with whole 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.380
 key combination that you maybe 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 once the monkey tree and emp grenades 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.459
 and abnormal semtex or 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.280
 can take a grenade and the 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.060
 You then hold three grenades or four 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.580
 cards and yes that was mine 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.540
 thoughts about it 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.370
 I would be interested to know what you think about it 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.700
 thinks and of course I will too 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.720
 pc if below link a link 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.640
 link to link 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.030
 and then you can do it more closely 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.940
 look at it is really long longer 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.880
 long, very long scrolling you are then 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.500
 you're done and you find new things 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.200
 I 'll do it again maybe 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.290
 the next video will arrive something 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.480
 more precisely because there is new game mode for 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.760
 the dlcs that might come 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.830
 that does not mean that is automatic and 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.410
 yes then I say goodbye for today 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.410
 skin in until next time servus
