00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the construction going on next door and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.160 
the construction going on next door and
it<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.729> unbelievable<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> walking

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it was just unbelievable so walking

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260 
it was just unbelievable so walking
along<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> beach<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> beautiful<00:01:47.549> Sun<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
along the beach and the beautiful Sun I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940 
along the beach and the beautiful Sun I
don't<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> admit<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.649> but

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
don't really like to admit this but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
don't really like to admit this but
probably<00:01:50.850> partly<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.689> pesky

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
probably partly because of that pesky

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
probably partly because of that pesky
ego<00:01:52.409> thing<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.920> during<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> walk<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.210> kept

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
ego thing but during the walk I kept

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
ego thing but during the walk I kept
doing<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.380> Muhammad<00:01:55.890> Ali<00:01:56.009> would<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.700> he

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
doing what Muhammad Ali would do and he

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.539 
doing what Muhammad Ali would do and he
said<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.299> am<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> greatest<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.710> said<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.369> even

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
said I am the greatest I said that even

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.510 
said I am the greatest I said that even
before<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.030> knew<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> was<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> seems<00:02:01.979> super

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
before I knew I was now it seems super

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
before I knew I was now it seems super
corny<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> cheesy<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.899> contention

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
corny and cheesy but it's my contention

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.609 
corny and cheesy but it's my contention
that<00:02:04.439> because<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.219> all<00:02:05.479> noncorporeal

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
that because we are all noncorporeal

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
that because we are all noncorporeal
energy<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:08.099> most<00:02:08.369> base<00:02:08.670> level<00:02:08.879> saying

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
energy at our most base level saying

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.850 
energy at our most base level saying
these<00:02:09.929> types<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.349> things<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.770> ourselves

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
these types of things to ourselves

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.710 
these types of things to ourselves
actually<00:02:11.489> changes<00:02:11.970> our<00:02:12.090> vibrational

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
actually changes our vibrational

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.850 
actually changes our vibrational

which<00:02:14.130> then<00:02:14.340> allows<00:02:14.640> us<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.970> stay<00:02:15.150> motivated

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450

that leads to belief and once that

that leads to belief and once that

and the gratitude prayers into my body
it<00:05:15.420> actually<00:05:15.510> changes<00:05:16.140> how<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.320> feel<00:05:16.740> about

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950
