a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.299> bit<00:01:45.540> try<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> make<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.450> circle

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
a little bit try to make it is circle

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.889 
a little bit try to make it is circle
ish<00:01:48.600> as<00:01:48.780> possible<00:01:50.030> then<00:01:51.030> take<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
that one taking the other square lay

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.620 
that one taking the other square lay
that<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.810> top<00:02:05.119> try<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> make<00:02:06.270> sure<00:02:06.329> there's<00:02:06.570> not
