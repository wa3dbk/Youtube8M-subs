pop out on the left side or the right

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
pop out on the left side or the right
side<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.560> able<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> transfers<00:01:32.520> back

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
side and be able to do transfers back

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.520 
side and be able to do transfers back
and<00:01:33.149> forth<00:01:33.359> on<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.749> fly<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> really

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and forth on the fly so it's a really

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230 
and forth on the fly so it's a really
great<00:01:34.770> system<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.310> makes<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.549> perfect<00:01:36.030> wave

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
great system and makes a perfect wave

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
great system and makes a perfect wave
and<00:01:36.570> also<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.289> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> system<00:01:37.679> called<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and also we have a system called the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
and also we have a system called the
power<00:01:38.189> which<00:01:38.429> -<00:01:38.640> we've<00:01:38.850> had<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> wedge<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
power which - we've had the wedge on the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.239 
power which - we've had the wedge on the
Malibu's<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.469> a<00:01:40.499> few<00:01:40.679> years<00:01:40.859> now<00:01:40.920> but

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
Malibu's for for a few years now but

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:42.950 
Malibu's for for a few years now but
it's<00:01:41.399> been<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.909> been<00:01:41.999> redesigned<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.749> year

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
it's been it's been redesigned this year

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.050 
it's been it's been redesigned this year
to<00:01:43.079> work<00:01:43.229> better<00:01:43.469> with<00:01:43.590> surf<00:01:44.009> gate<00:01:44.219> basically

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
to work better with surf gate basically

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.520 
to work better with surf gate basically
you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.240> change<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.569> angle<00:01:45.719> now<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you can change the angle now to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.870 
you can change the angle now to
different<00:01:46.859> increments<00:01:47.039> to<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.729> wave

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
different increments to make the wave

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700 
different increments to make the wave
steeper<00:01:48.390> flatter<00:01:48.749> depending<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.530> kind

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
steeper flatter depending on what kind

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
steeper flatter depending on what kind
of<00:01:49.770> surfing<00:01:50.069> you<00:01:50.130> want<00:01:50.249> to<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.399> doing<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:50.819> if

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
of surfing you want to be doing or if

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.669 
of surfing you want to be doing or if
you're<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.539> with<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:51.990> beginners<00:01:52.409> or

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
you're out there with some beginners or

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.319 
you're out there with some beginners or
some<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.460> advanced<00:01:53.759> guys<00:01:53.969> that<00:01:54.119> want<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
some more advanced guys that want a

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
some more advanced guys that want a
steeper<00:01:54.630> wave<00:01:54.829> so<00:01:55.829> those<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> three<00:01:56.399> key

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
steeper wave so those are the three key

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.830 
steeper wave so those are the three key
features<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.179> gonna<00:01:57.270> need<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> start
