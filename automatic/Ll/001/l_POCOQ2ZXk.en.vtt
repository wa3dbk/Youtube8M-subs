 South Korea capital 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.770
 what their creators are trying to do is to move 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.570
 to the people of the frenetic metropolis 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.790
 with the promise of a new way of 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.530
 life this is a city built from 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.050

 sensors to control traffic and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.710
 environment 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.960
 and we have a performing arts center 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 located on the water like the opera of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.820
 sydney because we wanted to build something 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.920
 similarly iconic mind we have a park 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.839

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.789

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.250
 to the venice channel system with its 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.750
 water taxis so that people can 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.750
 transported by this route 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.729
 but half the streets stores and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.490
 shopping centers of the cities 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.409
 are empty less than 20% of the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.020

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.150
 busy the incentives for the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.070
 companies move out of safe deep no 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.680
 have been strong enough to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.509
 exceed costs this despite the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.009
 state- of-the-art technology that 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.530
 has used in the infrastructure of the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.450
 city ​​at chadwick school 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.640

 Helen Lee decided to move from Seoul to 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.570
 go to work at school besides the 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.660
 technology says the best in the city 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.120
 they are the green spaces 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.100
 of corwin these children can do

 they just put an egg still warm 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.930
 I remember the last time I played a 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.930
 warm egg of a hen 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.160
 perhaps deep still does not achieve 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.140
 energy creativity that reigns in Seoul 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.880
 but its creators still do not give up 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.880
 before his dream of high modernity
