00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
fake carbon fiber in something like this

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.079 
fake carbon fiber in something like this
is<00:01:02.680> just<00:01:02.710> really<00:01:03.220> so<00:01:03.400> it's<00:01:03.640> not<00:01:03.699> even<00:01:03.909> fake

obviously fake leather but it's really
weird<00:01:13.570> cuz<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:13.930> almost<00:01:14.380> feels<00:01:15.010> like<00:01:15.189> that<00:01:15.490> kind

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
weird cuz it almost feels like that kind

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.499 
weird cuz it almost feels like that kind
of<00:01:15.700> sporty<00:01:16.210> cloth<00:01:16.479> material<00:01:17.080> but<00:01:17.290> it's<00:01:17.590> not

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
of sporty cloth material but it's not

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.969

buy<00:01:19.509> sporty<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:19.990> mean<00:01:20.200> whether<00:01:20.380> I'm<00:01:20.680> million

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
buy sporty I mean whether I'm million

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.859

like<00:01:21.100> why<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.430> waterproof<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.450> know<00:01:22.570> kind

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
like why that waterproof you know kind

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.470 
like why that waterproof you know kind
of<00:01:22.930> fabric<00:01:23.800> it's<00:01:24.070> just<00:01:24.250> strange<00:01:24.640> but<00:01:25.330> at<00:01:25.390> least

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
of fabric it's just strange but at least

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.450 
of fabric it's just strange but at least
it's<00:01:25.690> stitched<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.320> it's<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.950> looks<00:01:27.010> alright

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
it's stitched and it's it looks alright

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.150 
it's stitched and it's it looks alright
I<00:01:27.610> guess<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.140> interior<00:01:29.530> is<00:01:29.620> kind<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.890> random

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
I guess the interior is kind of random

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.100 
I guess the interior is kind of random
in<00:01:30.760> terms<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.420> way<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.660> style<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.050> don't

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
in terms of the way it style I don't

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.930 
in terms of the way it style I don't
think<00:01:32.200> it's<00:01:32.380> particularly<00:01:32.710> cohesive<00:01:33.670> but

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
think it's particularly cohesive but

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.470 
think it's particularly cohesive but
this<00:01:34.360> isn't<00:01:34.540> exactly<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.990> style<00:01:35.560> guru

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
this isn't exactly a style guru

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
class this thing has gotten some

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.390

criticism<00:02:19.629> for<00:02:19.720> its<00:02:19.870> ride<00:02:20.080> quality<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:20.830> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
criticism for its ride quality in the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.399 
criticism for its ride quality in the
press<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.209> would<00:02:22.599> avoid<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.319> I

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
press so I would avoid it and like I

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.920 
press so I would avoid it and like I
said<00:02:23.470> these<00:02:23.769> seats<00:02:24.040> are<00:02:24.250> kind<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.580> hard

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
said these seats are kind of hard

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.839 
said these seats are kind of hard
I<00:02:24.989> think<00:02:25.769> they're<00:02:25.920> supportive<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.519> have<00:02:26.670> really

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
I think they're supportive I have really

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.039 
I think they're supportive I have really
been<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.180> vehicle<00:02:27.329> long<00:02:27.689> enough<00:02:27.930> to

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
been in the vehicle long enough to

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.470 
been in the vehicle long enough to
really<00:02:28.200> get<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.640> decent<00:02:29.640> impression<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.269> them

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
really get a decent impression of them

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.170 
really get a decent impression of them
but<00:02:30.980> yeah<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.250> would<00:02:32.400> not<00:02:32.579> be<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> top<00:02:32.939> of<00:02:33.060> my

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
but yeah this would not be the top of my

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.030 
but yeah this would not be the top of my
list<00:02:34.079> if<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.349> was<00:02:34.530> looking<00:02:34.739> for<00:02:34.859> one<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:34.980> these

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
list if I was looking for one of these

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.979 
list if I was looking for one of these
things<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.519> would<00:02:35.579> definitely<00:02:36.150> check<00:02:36.719> out<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989
