00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.829
 a very nice book to look at the lyrics 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:54.290
 It is a very pleasant book that 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.780
 that I read it at night 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.370
 two days at night and only for the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.010
 night or are they law people one hundred 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.840
 pages at night and then I finished it 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.510
 last night I was up to one of 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.850
 the morning reading or some time ago 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.220
 enough time that I did not get to catch 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.920
 a book and be hours and hours and hours and 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.590
 hours and hours without stopping to read pages 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.460
 and pages that is a good short book 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.870
 three thinks is 64 pages but they give for 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.080
 One fact is that that's pretty good 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.690
 good is the debut efe here db 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.220
 patrick and he writes pretty well to me 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.800
 has impressed the truth because it is a 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.720
 debut is unbeatable a plot 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.590
 amazing super good characters 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.300
 defined in a shocking ending that yes 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.880
 that ends well does not leave much mystery 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.780
 but it is a final reader that we are 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.979
 with the heart 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.610
 and nothing goes of a fallen angel peace that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.300
 meet 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.950
 to nora and then to check to fall in love 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.950
 in hours is not that you fall in love with peace 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.100
 He does not record, he discovers that a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.990
 friend of yours can be a killer of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.970
 pressure a person with balaclava and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.370
 those of creating other things have visions 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.900
 that moves and good good heaps 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.060
 of super weird things to have with 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.990
 our peace that means peace means 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.330

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.550
