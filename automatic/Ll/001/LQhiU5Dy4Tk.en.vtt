00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.910
 all too long the box here we are 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.179
 yesterday opened to apple store after 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.590
 hamburg around us the new iphone 5 x 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.000
 so we can get it here for the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.870
 Of course blogs can show a bit 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.839
 can demonstrate 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 yes we are at 10 and there have been 200 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.510
 people were already there before us and us 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.109
 have stopped by until 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 until we finally go to the store 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.930
 The whole story could have gotten into it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 I text in my blog 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.869
 arrested 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.489
 now it's just about you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.250
 to show this device again 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 maybe you have already seen 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.070
 i already had hands in london 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.950
 contest do not try a bit 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.430
 So I know what to expect now 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.219
 in the device form and not as 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 pack device I have myself but 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.070
 Not because the equipment in London 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.969
 Of course, I was unpacked here 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 the 32 gigabyte iphone 5 and me 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:04.769
 believe 789 euro costs is natural 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:06.240
 no nice park 112 grams it weighs in 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.560
 scope of delivery you have home wenzler the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.340
 airports with both are the new ones 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.630
 headphone 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 of course I have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.290
 written because the devices are already on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.000
 had the hand in the moment and the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 headphones could stop 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.030
 either way, magic happens in this 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 carton battery empty fun here for the first time 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.869
 is first aside and we look 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.680
 First of all something in this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.680
 Catholic hides 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.270
 here you see now quite normal that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.740
 network with usb adapter and here is 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.420
 the fun lingering is the lightning 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:57.479
 cable that you see it hot on usb 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.490
 discussed so the fun looks lingering 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.280
 Juve can not put it in the wrong way 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.210
 he fits in both directions 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:10.390
 yes that cost us the airports 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.510
 normally in trade are nine 2099 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.190
 better than the predecessor headphones are 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.470
 but also bad for the money 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.300
 okay that was what it was me now 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.970
 Little wonder I'll take a look 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.220
 the ice that's the clip that you 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.550
 Stop him for the sim 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.550
 map 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.610
 that's what most of us never do 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.380
 see a few stickers still there 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.970
 we come to the iphone 5 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.120
 So there it is 112 grams 4 inches retina 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:52.440
 display with a resolution of 13 11 36 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:55.209
 x 640 800 to one should be the contrast 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.340
 amount at the brightness of 500 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.380
 candela 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.940
 that's what it looks like from the back 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.070
 hope you can see everything 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.790
 now the rumors have increased that 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.549
 the appliances in any batch 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.250
 now covered with muck were looking 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.070
 I look at my device and see if I am 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:22.110
 So I have a problem here 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:27.800
 first at the first glance no problem 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.740
 nee that everything looks okay 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.180
 yes you have the lines 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.180
 Connection was the cable ago 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.170
 it is made here so after nine years 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.380
 apple something else the accessories steer 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.470
 of six and then you have those too 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.150
 three company klenk for the headphones of the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.470
 your portal a remote control to 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.610
 bahrain now on so here you are 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.730
 again the facetime camera 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.450
 which has 1.2 megapixels could 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.950
 Record video calling up to 720p and 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.200
 30 pictures per second 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.640
 the back camera that has here 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.739
 led lightning has 8 megapixel camera and 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.109
 then he also does 1080p with and 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.109
 I also believe 30 photos per second 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.470
 especially to say it is one 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.220
 Panorama function not so special 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.160
 is it just an ios 60 euro iphone 4s 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.230
 So to have s video stabilizer 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.340
 have to test now that's about time 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:44.210
 The device I would have the mute 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.730
 volume yes and here the insert 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.960
 for those for the nano sense the fortunate ones 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.970
 came today and here I have quite normal 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.900
 the power button it looks like yes 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.900
 nothing in it 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:12.250
 So of course I was optics ago 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:13.690
 already very impressed so now only 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.090
 let's get out of here for the first time 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.990
 impression that first time I saw 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.760
 Will definitely be a few again 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.010
 videos make with opposite positions 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.340
 other devices the slightly longer 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.500
 test report let me first follow 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.820
 because I think so after a two 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.580
 one can not judge one another over days 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.010
 be to allow only comes after 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.510
 I would use it more intensively for a longer time 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.590
 that's what it looks like this is the iphone 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.720
 By the way, 5 1 is still available in 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.390
 to win my blog 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.390
 the link is in the article and the 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.140
 you can find article link below 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.330
 the video 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.560
 yes that was a long night somehow 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.070
 from the apple store I'm also one 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.300
 little space will write like now 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.810
 it happened again 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.030
 what happened you can do that 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.250
 I like to read my comments and me 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.480
 I'm looking forward to eating again 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.370
 get and again my channel 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.960
