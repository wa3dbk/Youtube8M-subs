the rest of thrust thrust capable
peroxide<00:00:43.200> yet<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> they<00:00:44.670> would<00:00:44.820> pump<00:00:45.510> pure

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
peroxide yet so they would pump pure

canvas<00:00:50.520> fits<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:51.329> its<00:00:51.510> theme<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> would

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
canvas fits in its theme and it would

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.979 
canvas fits in its theme and it would
catalyze<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.670> turn<00:00:53.850> into<00:00:53.969> steam<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> that's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
catalyze it turn into steam and that's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.119 
catalyze it turn into steam and that's
what<00:00:55.170> make<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> thrust<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.010> little

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
what make the thrust from this little

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.110 
what make the thrust from this little
tougher<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.730> actually<00:00:57.000> how<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
tougher so that's actually how the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.150 
tougher so that's actually how the
control<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:57.629> produced<00:00:57.989> by<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:58.949> little

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
control was produced by these little

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
control was produced by these little
little<00:00:59.760> puffer<00:01:00.030> jets<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.780> was<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> very

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
little puffer jets so it was the very

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.060 
little puffer jets so it was the very
first<00:01:01.460> RCS<00:01:02.460> rat<00:01:02.699> reaction<00:01:03.090> control<00:01:03.359> system

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
first RCS rat reaction control system

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.929 
first RCS rat reaction control system
one<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> neat<00:01:05.339> things<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
one of the neat things about this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.490 
one of the neat things about this
aircraft<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> people<00:01:07.229> don't

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
aircraft that a lot of people don't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
aircraft that a lot of people don't
realize<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.479> difficult

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
realize is it really difficult

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.060 
realize is it really difficult
fly-by-wire<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.010> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
fly-by-wire it's right it's like a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.640 
fly-by-wire it's right it's like a
normal<00:01:11.580> thing<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.479> f-8<00:01:12.780> crusader<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
normal thing the f-8 crusader is the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.520 
normal thing the f-8 crusader is the
first<00:01:13.920> digital<00:01:14.280> fly-by-wire<00:01:14.549> air<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.659> no

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
first digital fly-by-wire air right no

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
first digital fly-by-wire air right no
it's<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.030> game<00:01:18.240> before<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it's not this is this game before that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.570 
it's not this is this game before that
so<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:20.280> flu<00:01:20.640> fly-by-wire<00:01:21.180> before<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> fjp

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
so this flu fly-by-wire before the fjp

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
so this flu fly-by-wire before the fjp
they<00:01:23.580> call<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.090> first<00:01:24.299> digital

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
they call that the first digital

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.770 
they call that the first digital
fly-by-wire<00:01:24.810> airplane<00:01:25.799> yeah<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.509> scar

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
fly-by-wire airplane yeah this is scar

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.690 
fly-by-wire airplane yeah this is scar
crap<00:01:28.080> yeah<00:01:30.439> then<00:01:31.439> she<00:01:31.799> got<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.130> kicking<00:01:32.340> third

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
crap yeah then she got my kicking third

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.569 
crap yeah then she got my kicking third
reason<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.500> again<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.430> on

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
reason like that and again if you're on

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.100 
reason like that and again if you're on

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
look back here for a second these are

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740 
look back here for a second these are
the<00:01:46.290> peroxide<00:01:46.710> tanks<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.880> sorry<00:01:48.180> big<00:01:48.570> deal

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the peroxide tanks I'm sorry big deal

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.120 
the peroxide tanks I'm sorry big deal
with<00:01:48.840> makes<00:01:49.020> these<00:01:49.200> aprox<00:01:49.500> i<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.920> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
with makes these aprox i think that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.840 
with makes these aprox i think that
period<00:01:51.140> these<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.290> radar<00:01:52.560> altimeters<00:01:52.860> right

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
period these are radar altimeters right

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.480 
period these are radar altimeters right
here<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:55.259> back<00:01:55.290> here<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> very

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
here and then back here is the very

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
here and then back here is the very
first<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.969> log<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.899> flight<00:01:58.110> control

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
first a log this will flight control

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.330 
first a log this will flight control
computers<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> very<00:01:59.280> first

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
computers that's the very first

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.149 
computers that's the very first
fly-by-wire<00:02:00.530> one<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.680> new<00:02:01.770> things<00:02:01.799> about

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
fly-by-wire one of the new things about

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.370 
fly-by-wire one of the new things about
that<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.060> now<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> make<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that is you know now we want to make a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590 
that is you know now we want to make a
game<00:02:04.680> change<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> control<00:02:06.149> system<00:02:06.329> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
game change for a control system you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.249 
game change for a control system you
simply<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.140> put<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> new<00:02:07.560> new<00:02:08.129> value

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
simply can put a new new value

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.350 
simply can put a new new value
right<00:02:09.470> Lennon<00:02:10.189> exist<00:02:10.519> back<00:02:10.700> then<00:02:10.759> they

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
right Lennon exist back then they

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.140 
right Lennon exist back then they
literally<00:02:11.629> unsung<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.170> liar<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.799> we'd<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
literally unsung a liar and we'd to a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.119 
literally unsung a liar and we'd to a
different<00:02:14.450> resistor<00:02:14.810> value<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.620> change<00:02:15.860> that

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
different resistor value to change that

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.839 
different resistor value to change that
change<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.239> game<00:02:17.420> set<00:02:17.890> pretty<00:02:18.890> cool<00:02:19.069> stuff<00:02:19.310> so

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
change the game set pretty cool stuff so
