00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.040
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:16.410
 497 task we analyze the number of inhabitants 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:21.720
 city ​​750,000 people 700,750 thousand 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.779
 people annually population in it 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.180
 increases by 2 percent 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:36.230
 how many people will be in a year after 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:36.230
 two years, see 750 thousand to 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.780
 a year later wore in it will be at 2 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 percent more inhabitants 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.730
 How to find out how much it will be? 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 total residents in a year will be at 2 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 percent more that is we multiply by 2 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.829
 percent 2 percent is two hundredths if 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.670
 we multiply the total number of resident by 2 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.979
 percent we will know how many people will be 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 the easiest way to multiply i would be simpler 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.680
 just like that multiplied to start 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.750
 i see these two zeros will not 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.560
 write a comma here in two characters 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.880
 I will transfer 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 2 times that is, I like two zeros here 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.590
 but removed here a comma in two characters 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.710
 moved so convenient truth and now 70 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.009
 a half thousand multiply by 2 is obtained 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.079
 15 thousand could multiply in a column 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.430
 that number to that number would be very 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.619
 big number and then you comma 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.020
 moved to 2 characters and everything he would 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:44.340
 15,000 so now we live in the city 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.570
 here are so many people and in a year will live 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.869
 15 thousand more so it will be here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.759
 so many residents a year later in a year 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.820
 so many people will live here 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 and we are asked how long it will live 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.409
 residents in the city 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.200
 in two years if the population is annually 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 increased by 2 percent then in 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.940
 next year the number of inhabitants again 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.060
 increase by 2 percent let's get this 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.170
 I will count it for the sake of 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.970
 of diversity 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.190
 the number of residents who will be through 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.970
 year to live you need to count two percent of 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.660
 of this number let's now for the sake of 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.819
 of diversity 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.250
 here so I count in a column not as in 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:34.319
 last time 200 200 200 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.440
 two to 5 10 0 we write 1 in mind 2 to 6 12 to 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:44.390
 1 in mind 13 3 we write 1 in mind 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:46.709
 2 v 7 14 one more by you 15 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.300
 well if we multiply by zero here 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.010
 it will be 0 and therefore you can not even 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.580
 write and comma is transferable to 2 characters 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.860
 one or two and here on 2 characters 1 2 see 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.080
 since the residents have become a little more then 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 and the increase will be more now 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.870
 15 thousand three hundred 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 that is, we will have residents in a year 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:11.569
 seven hundred sixty five thousand seven hundred 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.569
 five thousand a year to live and 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.570
 growth next year will be no longer 15 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.299
 thousand and 15 300 then the residents became 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.760
 more therefore and gain 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.859
 increased so here is zero here 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.780
 we add this number of inhabitants 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.030
 who will live in a year and this 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.310
 increase that will be in a year that is 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.190
 in two years there will be the sum of these 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.989
 two values ​​here are three here are 5 to 50 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.890
 we write 1 in mind here it turns out 8 and here 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.890
 7 means through 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:51.299
 in two years there will be 780 thousand three hundred 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.739
 people because unwound again 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.290
 quickly go seems to me nothing 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.660
 it is clear to someone at first was so much 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.560
 residents two percent of this number is 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:07.060
 15,000 so for the year the population 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.190
 will increase by 15,000 and become like this 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.020
 but now the inhabitants are bigger and two 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.020
 percent of this number is already 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.550
 great values and when we already to these 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.359
 people who will live in a year 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:24.430
 add more here as the city will 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:25.690
 Already live so much for me 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.460
 seems like a daunting task 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.080
 poorly explained and and therefore necessarily 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.740
 write in the comments how clear 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.419
 it seemed to me that somehow 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.950
 messy yes write a little 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.820
 comments as far as the decision is clear 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.820
 bye everyone
