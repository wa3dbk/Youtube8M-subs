really because um you know I'm lazy and
so<00:03:53.150> now<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.019> just<00:03:54.440> need<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.739> UM<00:03:55.780> put<00:03:56.780> up<00:03:57.500> the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
so now you just need to UM put up the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.560 
so now you just need to UM put up the
heart<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:58.040> your<00:03:58.160> wall<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.670> actually<00:03:59.120> put<00:03:59.420> mine

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
heart on your wall I actually put mine

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.710 
heart on your wall I actually put mine
under<00:03:59.840> my<00:04:00.230> bed<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.580> this<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.239> what<00:04:02.480> it

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
under my bed and so this is what it

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.460 
under my bed and so this is what it
looks<00:04:02.900> like<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:04.340> made<00:04:04.910> some<00:04:05.209> adjustments<00:04:05.690> to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
looks like I made some adjustments to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.440 
looks like I made some adjustments to
make<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.800> heart<00:04:06.980> wider<00:04:07.190> because<00:04:07.580> if<00:04:08.180> it's

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
make the heart wider because if it's

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.440 
make the heart wider because if it's
long<00:04:08.930> then<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.800> won't<00:04:10.010> turn<00:04:10.459> out<00:04:10.610> as<00:04:10.850> good<00:04:11.239> as

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
long then it won't turn out as good as

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.949 
long then it won't turn out as good as
if<00:04:12.050> it's<00:04:12.380> wide<00:04:12.860> yes<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.030> may<00:04:14.360> take<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.690> lot<00:04:14.900> of

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
if it's wide yes it may take a lot of

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.250 
if it's wide yes it may take a lot of
time<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.620> at<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.370> end<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:16.850> really<00:04:17.600> cute<00:04:18.019> and

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
time but at the end it's really cute and

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.440 
time but at the end it's really cute and
it's<00:04:18.709> really<00:04:19.280> really<00:04:19.400> worth<00:04:20.030> it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
it's really really worth it

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.920 
it's really really worth it
and<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.919> can<00:04:22.010> see<00:04:22.070> MOCA<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.120> really<00:04:23.660> loving

paper for the frame and then since the
pictures<00:05:35.320> kind<00:05:35.680> of<00:05:35.860> overlap<00:05:36.670> the<00:05:37.120> original

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
pictures kind of overlap the original

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.060 
pictures kind of overlap the original
paper<00:05:38.140> I<00:05:38.440> had<00:05:38.980> to<00:05:39.250> cut<00:05:39.550> them<00:05:39.700> out<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:41.560> both

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
paper I had to cut them out so the both

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.960 
paper I had to cut them out so the both
of<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.310> papers<00:05:42.700> will<00:05:43.210> fit<00:05:43.840> on<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.980> real<00:05:45.610> frame

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:25.140 
pebbles in to make sure it's secure and
then<00:07:21.610> what<00:07:22.059> you<00:07:22.150> want<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.419> do<00:07:22.659> is<00:07:23.020> just<00:07:24.150> like

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
then what you want to do is just like

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.269 
then what you want to do is just like

move it around so that there's no pebble
showing<00:07:27.789> on<00:07:27.999> the<00:07:28.120> top<00:07:34.229> so<00:07:35.229> this<00:07:35.409> is<00:07:35.559> the<00:07:35.680> final

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:35.979 
showing on the top so this is the final

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:38.730 
showing on the top so this is the final
result<00:07:36.129> I<00:07:36.610> thought<00:07:37.120> this<00:07:37.330> one<00:07:37.629> was<00:07:37.659> great<00:07:38.529> for
