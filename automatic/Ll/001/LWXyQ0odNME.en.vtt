can be bugs and one of the major bugs I
am<00:00:17.310> experiencing<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.240> every<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.050> play<00:00:19.109> it

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
am experiencing is every time I play it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.670 
am experiencing is every time I play it
doesn't<00:00:20.490> exactly<00:00:20.820> save<00:00:21.270> my<00:00:21.449> progress<00:00:21.810> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
doesn't exactly save my progress it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.650 
doesn't exactly save my progress it
saves<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> point<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> jumps

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
saves it to a point but then it jumps

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.290 
saves it to a point but then it jumps
back<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.199> about<00:00:25.650> five<00:00:26.070> previous<00:00:26.760> checkpoints

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
back to about five previous checkpoints

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.580 
back to about five previous checkpoints
it<00:00:27.390> happened<00:00:27.720> after<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> recorded<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> first

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it happened after I recorded the first

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.660 
it happened after I recorded the first
video<00:00:28.800> I'd<00:00:29.130> go<00:00:29.310> through<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> entire

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
video I'd go through the entire

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.359 
video I'd go through the entire
laboratory<00:00:30.210> sequence<00:00:30.869> again<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
laboratory sequence again and then you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.040 
laboratory sequence again and then you
may<00:00:32.520> remember<00:00:32.700> off<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.120> last<00:00:33.270> video<00:00:33.510> where

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
may remember off to my last video where

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.810 
may remember off to my last video where
I<00:00:34.110> did<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> entire<00:00:34.710> jetpack<00:00:35.130> sequence<00:00:35.579> with

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I did the entire jetpack sequence with

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.170 
I did the entire jetpack sequence with
the<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.780> loads<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.730> amplified<00:00:38.730> double

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the like loads of amplified double

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.080 
the like loads of amplified double
jumping<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.719> loads<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> platforming<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:41.090> I've

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
jumping and loads of platforming I I've

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.229 
jumping and loads of platforming I I've
lost<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.100> appears<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:45.000> game

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
lost over so it appears that this game

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.990 
lost over so it appears that this game
adds<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.110> current<00:00:46.739> bug<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.760> safe

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
adds a current bug right now the safe

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.150 
adds a current bug right now the safe
system<00:00:48.480> isn't<00:00:48.719> working<00:00:48.960> too<00:00:49.530> much<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> I've

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
system isn't working too much and I've

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.450 
system isn't working too much and I've
also<00:00:50.280> discovered<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:52.070> no<00:00:53.070> I've<00:00:53.430> already

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
I've also discovered that not over

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
I've also discovered that not over
levels<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> game<00:01:00.390> as

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
levels are actually out for the game as

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.810 
levels are actually out for the game as
it<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.170> right<00:01:01.379> now<00:01:01.440> there's<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:02.190> quite<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
few or like there's only eight levels

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.940 
few or like there's only eight levels
out<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.400> 20<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.689> currently<00:01:06.990> available<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.920> if

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
out of 20 are currently available so if

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.590 
out of 20 are currently available so if
I<00:01:08.280> did<00:01:08.460> continue<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.090> play<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.360> I'd

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
