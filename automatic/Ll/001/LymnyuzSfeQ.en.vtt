okay um the other high on the priority

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.670 
okay um the other high on the priority
was<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.180> clients<00:01:40.720> wanted<00:01:40.990> privacy<00:01:41.140> from<00:01:41.560> the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
was the clients wanted privacy from the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.670 
was the clients wanted privacy from the
street<00:01:41.950> yep<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:43.000> I<00:01:43.479> had<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.869> make<00:01:44.050> ensure<00:01:44.500> they

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
street yep so I had to make ensure they

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.040 
street yep so I had to make ensure they
had<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:44.860> low-key<00:01:45.490> yeah<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.060> single-story<00:01:46.600> facade

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
had a low-key yeah a single-story facade

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.170 
had a low-key yeah a single-story facade
from<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.440> street<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.850> other<00:01:48.970> thing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
from the street and the other thing

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.999 
from the street and the other thing
you'll<00:01:49.420> notice<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.810> those<00:01:50.259> I'm<00:01:50.500> inclined

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
you'll notice is those I'm inclined

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.520 
you'll notice is those I'm inclined
client<00:01:51.850> cold<00:01:52.060> as<00:01:52.540> well<00:01:52.810> as<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.050> screening

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
client cold as well as the screening

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.710 
client cold as well as the screening
yeah<00:01:53.890> now<00:01:54.430> these<00:01:54.670> windows<00:01:55.090> these<00:01:55.330> are<00:01:55.390> the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
yeah now these windows these are the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.790 
yeah now these windows these are the
whole<00:01:55.930> back<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> house<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.530> pretty<00:01:56.649> much

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
whole back of the house is pretty much

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.340 
whole back of the house is pretty much
windows<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.490> they<00:01:57.580> see<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.970> no<00:01:58.810> not<00:01:59.080> with<00:01:59.229> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
windows can they see it no not with the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.410 
windows can they see it no not with the
reflection<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.009> glass<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.240> way<00:02:01.360> you

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
reflection of the glass so the way you

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.029 
reflection of the glass so the way you
designed<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.960> glass<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:02.560> obviously<00:02:02.890> got

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
designed the glass it's obviously got

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.529 
designed the glass it's obviously got
some<00:02:03.190> little<00:02:03.369> filter<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.789> here<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.509> a

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
some little filter on here if this is a

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.420 
some little filter on here if this is a
green<00:02:04.930> glass<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.470> it's<00:02:05.619> also<00:02:05.770> providing

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
green glass so it's also providing

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.340 
green glass so it's also providing
protection<00:02:06.910> from<00:02:07.119> overheating

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
protection from overheating

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.139 
protection from overheating
that's<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.890> western<00:02:09.250> facade<00:02:09.399> down<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:09.910> side

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
that's the western facade down this side

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.490 
that's the western facade down this side
so<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.810> where<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:10.990> gets<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.200> hottest

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
so this is where it gets the hottest

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.620 
so this is where it gets the hottest
around<00:02:11.890> okay<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.940> wanted<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.390> hot

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
around okay but you wanted to get hot

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.840 
around okay but you wanted to get hot
from<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.319> northern<00:02:14.680> area<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.520> heats<00:02:15.610> up

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
from the northern area so it heats up

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.730 
from the northern area so it heats up
that<00:02:15.880> beautiful<00:02:16.230> thermal<00:02:17.230> wall<00:02:17.410> will<00:02:17.620> go

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
that beautiful thermal wall will go

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.839 
that beautiful thermal wall will go
through<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.010> middle<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> house<00:02:18.430> correct

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
through the middle of the house correct

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.400 
through the middle of the house correct
so<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.480> middle<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.900> that's<00:02:20.230> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
so back in the middle is that's the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.540 
so back in the middle is that's the
shielded<00:02:20.770> area<00:02:21.010> through<00:02:21.220> there

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
shielded area through there

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.309 
shielded area through there
so<00:02:21.849> I'm<00:02:21.970> using<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.420> passive<00:02:23.020> solar

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
so I'm using the passive solar

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.350 
so I'm using the passive solar
principles<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.099> utmost<00:02:24.220> yep<00:02:24.760> absorbing

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
principles to the utmost yep absorbing

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.910 
principles to the utmost yep absorbing
that<00:02:25.450> Sun<00:02:25.690> into<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.110> thick<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.349> earth<00:02:26.620> wall

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
that Sun into that thick and earth wall

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.530 
that Sun into that thick and earth wall
yep<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:27.940> that's<00:02:28.120> really<00:02:28.209> our

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
yep and then that's really our

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.690 
yep and then that's really our
irradiated<00:02:29.230> late<00:02:29.380> at<00:02:29.500> night<00:02:29.680> which<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.400> great

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
irradiated late at night which is great

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.560 
irradiated late at night which is great
it's<00:02:30.849> just<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.180> clever

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
it's just so clever

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.240 
it's just so clever
here's<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.660> design<00:02:33.930> tip<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.770> materials

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
and accentuates the architectural form

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.690 
and accentuates the architectural form
we<00:03:33.390> always<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.780> idea<00:03:34.020> that<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
we always have the idea that the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.830 
we always have the idea that the
karent's<00:03:35.700> area<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.209> house<00:03:36.390> will<00:03:36.570> be<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.690> bit

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
karent's area to house will be a bit

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.350 
karent's area to house will be a bit
removed<00:03:37.110> from<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
removed from the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.300 
removed from the
so<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:38.840> decided<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.290> make<00:03:39.560> use<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.040> links

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
so we decided to make use of the links

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.340 
so we decided to make use of the links
of<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.490> block<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.000> start<00:03:41.720> with<00:03:41.870> our<00:03:41.960> bedroom

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
of the block and start with our bedroom

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.380 
of the block and start with our bedroom
leading<00:03:42.980> through<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.490> ensuite<00:03:43.790> area<00:03:44.180> add

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
leading through to the ensuite area add

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.600 
leading through to the ensuite area add
that<00:03:44.510> into<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.840> house<00:03:45.020> and<00:03:45.410> for<00:03:45.800> us<00:03:45.890> I<00:03:46.160> guess

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
that into the house and for us I guess

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.360 
that into the house and for us I guess
it's<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.820> bit<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.090> retreat<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.720> little<00:03:48.470> zoning

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
it's a bit of a retreat a little zoning

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.130 
it's a bit of a retreat a little zoning
and<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.850> courtyard<00:03:50.300> in<00:03:50.480> between<00:03:50.780> sort<00:03:51.080> of

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
and the courtyard in between sort of

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.260 
and the courtyard in between sort of
separates<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.160> guess<00:03:52.430> from<00:03:52.580> from<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.030> next

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
separates it I guess from from the next

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.360 
separates it I guess from from the next
bedroom<00:03:53.480> area<00:03:54.320> which<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.620> which<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.130> two

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
bedroom area which is which is the two

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.100 
bedroom area which is which is the two
kids<00:03:55.640> veterans<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.240> it's<00:03:56.750> funny<00:03:57.020> that

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
kids veterans and it's funny that

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.920 
kids veterans and it's funny that
originally<00:03:57.620> we'd<00:03:57.800> always<00:03:58.040> thought<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.930> the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
originally we'd always thought the the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.470 
originally we'd always thought the the
bedrooms<00:04:00.590> would<00:04:00.890> be<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.610> waterfront<00:04:02.030> but

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
bedrooms would be on the waterfront but

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.030 
bedrooms would be on the waterfront but
Mike<00:04:02.690> very<00:04:02.930> quickly<00:04:03.170> made<00:04:03.440> us<00:04:03.590> realise<00:04:03.890> that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
Mike very quickly made us realise that

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.850 
Mike very quickly made us realise that
you<00:04:04.160> don't<00:04:04.340> put<00:04:04.520> a<00:04:04.550> bedroom<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.510> prime

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
you don't put a bedroom on the prime

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.980 
you don't put a bedroom on the prime
aspect<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.580> block<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.660> it's

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
aspect of of the block so and it's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.500 
aspect of of the block so and it's
worked<00:04:09.200> out<00:04:09.350> well<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:10.100> it<00:04:10.700> works<00:04:11.180> really<00:04:11.390> well

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
worked out well and it works really well

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.990 
worked out well and it works really well
up<00:04:11.750> there<00:04:12.040> okay<00:04:13.040> what's<00:04:13.250> downstairs<00:04:13.670> so

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
up there okay what's downstairs so

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.280 
up there okay what's downstairs so
downstairs<00:04:14.510> we've<00:04:14.630> got<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> completely

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
downstairs we've got a completely

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.050 
downstairs we've got a completely
separate<00:04:15.650> zone<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.340> that's<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.579> zone<00:04:16.640> for

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
separate zone and that's the zone for

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.880 
separate zone and that's the zone for
Simon<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.450> work<00:04:17.690> with<00:04:17.840> his<00:04:17.959> office<00:04:18.260> but<00:04:18.530> also<00:04:18.709> a

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
Simon to work with his office but also a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.860 
Simon to work with his office but also a
zone<00:04:19.190> that's<00:04:19.400> quite<00:04:19.609> flexible<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:20.299> be<00:04:20.329> for

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
zone that's quite flexible to be for

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.540 
zone that's quite flexible to be for
their<00:04:21.019> guests<00:04:21.290> later<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.709> okay<00:04:22.160> now<00:04:22.190> you've

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
their guests later on okay now you've

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.740 
their guests later on okay now you've
got<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.760> double<00:04:22.970> storey<00:04:23.270> here<00:04:23.480> at<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.600> back

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
got a double storey here at the back

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.480 
got a double storey here at the back
yeah<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.350> well<00:04:24.620> how<00:04:24.860> high<00:04:25.040> we're<00:04:25.250> allowed<00:04:25.460> to

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
yeah so well how high we're allowed to

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.790 
yeah so well how high we're allowed to
go<00:04:25.610> here<00:04:25.940> one<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.600> requirements<00:04:27.320> was<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
go here one of the requirements was to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.440 
go here one of the requirements was to
actually<00:04:27.919> design<00:04:28.370> within<00:04:28.730> five<00:04:28.970> meters<00:04:29.180> of

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
actually design within five meters of

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.630 
actually design within five meters of
height<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.380> whole<00:04:30.710> concept<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.580> pretty

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
height so the whole concept is pretty

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.640 
height so the whole concept is pretty
tight<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.419> very<00:04:32.720> tight<00:04:32.990> and<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.320> couldn't

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
tight it is very tight and I couldn't

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.560 
tight it is very tight and I couldn't
guarantee<00:04:33.830> like<00:04:34.220> actually<00:04:34.550> do<00:04:34.700> that<00:04:34.850> at<00:04:35.450> the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
guarantee like actually do that at the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.659 
guarantee like actually do that at the
start<00:04:35.870> but<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:36.200> cleverly<00:04:36.710> was<00:04:37.010> able<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.280> bunker

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
start but we cleverly was able to bunker

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.730 
start but we cleverly was able to bunker
that<00:04:37.700> home<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.390> there's<00:04:39.110> maltese<00:04:39.440> malti

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
that home in and there's maltese malti

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.470 
that home in and there's maltese malti
levels<00:04:40.220> throughout<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.610> home<00:04:40.790> yeah<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.330> she

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
levels throughout the home yeah that she

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.330 
levels throughout the home yeah that she
works<00:04:41.690> with<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.990> contours<00:04:42.440> okay<00:04:43.040> now<00:04:43.190> though

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
works with the contours okay now though

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.860 
works with the contours okay now though
owners<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.790> very<00:04:44.120> good<00:04:44.300> sense<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.600> design

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
owners have a very good sense of design

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.870
