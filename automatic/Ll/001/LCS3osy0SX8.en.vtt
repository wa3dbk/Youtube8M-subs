00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.880
 how does it work 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.710
 computer irreplaceable components 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.589
 human society he handles 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.120
 pictures sounds numbers words fortunately all 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.070
 information can be saved to 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.070
 lose when the computer turns off 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.349
 hard drive task inside computer 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 save and issue information very 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.130
 fast hard drive amazing 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.259
 computer industry inventions 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 he can keep astronomical 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.920
 amount of information this miniature 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.780
 the device records practically 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.159
 unlimited amount of information 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.159
 I use the laws of physics 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.960
 stage 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.229
 how does he do that you need to understand 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229
 break down 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.320
 The hard disk consists of five main 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.940
 parts integrated circuit 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.660
 synchronizes the disk with 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.760
 the computer controls all the processes 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.480
 electric motor rotates the disk approximately 7200 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.310
 1 minute 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.980
 integrated circuits support speed 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.420
 constantly 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.430
 and now the most important part 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.910
 rocker that writes and reads 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.100
 information 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.450
 rocker end is divided to work 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.810
 immediately with several disks but the head 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.040
 yoke never touch the disk 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.140
 the gap between the surface of the disk and 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.170
 head is 5000 times smaller than 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.790
 human hair 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.450
 the handle removes air which accelerates 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.770
 rotating disk protect yourself to 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.360
 necessary if we want to use 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.800
 this device for years 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.590
 and what damage may be 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.240
 disk damage is not a metaphor 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.300
 such thin layers of head weight 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 equal to the weight of 747 and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.180
 weight 747 aircraft is comparable to weight 100 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.730
 thousands of passengers flying at speed 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.690
 one hundred kilometers an hour deviation in share 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.690
 millimeters and all 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.990
 frictional force also plays an important role 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.260
 when the beam starts to read 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.670
 information shifting to 60 1 second 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.560
 motor rocker invisible because 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.030
 this electromagnetic system works on 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.830
 interaction of two forces of nature 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.320
 electricity and magnetism 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.400
 such interaction to accelerate the rocker 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.400
 to light speeds 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.670
 Yes, and says go components now 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.930
 talk about storage before 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.450
 data is stored in narrow tracks on 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.640
 disc surface during production at 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.220
 the disk creates more than 200 thousand such 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:02.690
 tracks each track is divided into 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.730
 sectors of the map are more expensive to the sector allow 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.660
 heads determine where to write or where 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.660
 read information 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.170
 the surface of the disc is smooth but shiny 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.170
 closer look at the structure 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.090
 turns out to be harder 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.390
 fer magnetic film on the surface 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.129
 remembers all information head 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.870
 magnetizes the microscopic region 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.799
 on the film setting the magnetic moment 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.629
 such a cell b1 state 0 or one 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.590
 each such zero and one are called 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.690
 the bits value of bits corresponds to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.670
 orientation of the magnetic field plus or 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.659
 minus u and don't worry about 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.489
 data integrity 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.920
 good quality photography takes 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.560
 about 29 million of these cells and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.560
 scattered across 12 different sectors 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.290
 sounds impressive but in 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.030
 reality is so incredible 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.040
 the number of bits takes very 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.220
 small area on the surface of the disk 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.359
 every square centimeter of surface 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.370
 power switch 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:08.940
 31 billion bits that's what I understand 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.530
 memory hard drive writes and issues 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.920
 information at speeds which is difficult 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.920
 imagine 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.600
 using the law of magnetism fine 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.180
 disc film can remember a lot 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 different encyclopedias or hundreds of thousands 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.220
 photos easy hard drive on the very 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.199
 amaze or miniature device 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.440
 I write down any information in small 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.440
 trouble 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.880
 this engineering masterpiece expands 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.880
 scope of intelligent physics and bit by bit 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.530
 can 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.279
 but
