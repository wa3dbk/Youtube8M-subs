really<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.160> sports<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.360> two<00:02:12.540> or

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
really we think sports is one of two or

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.570 
really we think sports is one of two or
three<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> best<00:02:13.260> ways<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> connect<00:02:14.400> with

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
three of the best ways to connect with

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.280 
three of the best ways to connect with
your<00:02:14.730> community<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.420> connect<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.050> lost

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
your community to connect with lost

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.080 
your community to connect with lost
people<00:02:16.680> music<00:02:17.129> would<00:02:17.280> certainly<00:02:17.580> be<00:02:17.790> another

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
people music would certainly be another

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.449 
people music would certainly be another
one<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.420> those<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.870> everybody<00:02:19.800> loves<00:02:20.160> but

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
one of those that everybody loves but

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.140 
one of those that everybody loves but
particularly<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.420> America

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
particularly in America

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.290 
particularly in America
we're<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:22.990> sports<00:02:23.560> crazy<00:02:24.069> culture<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.970> so

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
we're a sports crazy culture and so

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540 
we're a sports crazy culture and so
that's<00:02:25.480> where<00:02:25.720> lost<00:02:26.110> people<00:02:26.530> are<00:02:26.709> they<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.520> a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
that's where lost people are they have a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.550 
that's where lost people are they have a
passion<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.540> do<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:28.959> sports<00:02:29.290> and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
passion just like we do for sports and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.100 
passion just like we do for sports and
so<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:30.520> doesn't<00:02:30.910> make<00:02:31.060> sense<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.540> us<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:32.080> a

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
so it doesn't make sense to us that a

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.559 
so it doesn't make sense to us that a
church<00:02:32.350> not<00:02:32.740> do<00:02:33.069> sports<00:02:33.430> ministry<00:02:33.940> you've<00:02:34.360> got
