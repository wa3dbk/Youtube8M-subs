jeopardy but I suck at it so if I get a
couple<00:02:12.830> answers<00:02:13.130> right<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.519> whole<00:02:13.670> show<00:02:13.880> I'm

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
couple answers right the whole show I'm

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.479 
couple answers right the whole show I'm
pumped<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.170> press<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.470> right<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.220> spin

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
pumped the press is right just to spin

that<00:02:16.670> wheel<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.750> have<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.140> spin<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.560> wheel

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
that wheel you have to spin the wheel

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.100 
that wheel you have to spin the wheel
out<00:02:18.739> of<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.190> big<00:02:19.400> money<00:02:19.670> big<00:02:20.030> money<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.600> don't

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
out of one big money big money I don't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.250 
out of one big money big money I don't
know<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:22.120> think<00:02:23.120> would<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.420> be<00:02:23.510> price<00:02:24.080> is

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
know I think would have to be price is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.000 
know I think would have to be price is
right<00:02:25.930> every<00:02:26.930> every<00:02:27.260> day<00:02:27.410> after<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> gym<00:02:27.950> I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
right every every day after the gym I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.340 
right every every day after the gym I
like<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.580> like<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.120> tune<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.870> price<00:02:30.319> is

like to like to tune in to the price is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.550 
like to like to tune in to the price is
right<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.000> test<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.180> luck<00:02:32.360> I'd<00:02:33.049> probably<00:02:33.290> do

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
right and test my luck I'd probably do

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.539 
right and test my luck I'd probably do
wheel<00:02:34.069> of<00:02:34.100> fortune<00:02:35.350> spin<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.380> wheel<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.799> like

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
wheel of fortune spin the wheel and like

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.750 
wheel of fortune spin the wheel and like
just<00:02:38.030> gonna<00:02:38.180> guess<00:02:38.450> she's<00:02:38.959> all<00:02:39.140> right<00:02:39.760> yeah

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760
