 What a mood on Sunday evening at the public viewing in the old ice rink 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:14.479
 around 4,800 people were in Friedrichs Park in Mannheim as the German

 Everything was organized by the Eichbaum brewery and the city 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:24.909
 in Mannheim 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.080
 the spectators lacked nothing 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.490
 Food and drink and of course a sense of community of a special kind 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.410

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.280

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.709

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:59.910
 better than living room 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.290
 yes definitely that as the last dttb representative Serb but now betrayed 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 and somehow it really aroused love 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.800
 Well, that's how it was 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.140
 not only the right rhythms but also black-red-gold 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.920
 Make-up and banners 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.750
 Almost everything was allowed 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.280
 except the torvic vuvuzela in this way the provider 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.480

 Mood is well occupied the project was 7 vol 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.870
 no big incident set 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.350
 Percent is because something expected or something so far from the audience 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.140
 Groups is the federal election 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.910
