00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.080 
see right here we do have some new
vanguard<00:00:52.990> weapons<00:00:53.620> as<00:00:53.740> well<00:00:54.160> let's<00:00:54.580> start<00:00:54.730> off

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
vanguard weapons as well let's start off

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.380 
vanguard weapons as well let's start off
at<00:00:55.450> a<00:00:55.480> base<00:00:55.780> damage<00:00:56.110> of<00:00:56.380> 300<00:00:57.310> so<00:00:57.730> first<00:00:58.000> up<00:00:58.270> we

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
at a base damage of 300 so first up we

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.220 
at a base damage of 300 so first up we
have<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.920> por-15<00:01:00.330> 62<00:01:01.330> now<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:01.930> in

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
have the por-15 62 now this is in

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.049 
have the por-15 62 now this is in
Japanese<00:01:02.680> so<00:01:02.830> it's<00:01:02.980> kind<00:01:03.130> of<00:01:03.160> hard<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.430> see<00:01:03.670> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
Japanese so it's kind of hard to see the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.820 
Japanese so it's kind of hard to see the
stats<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.629> stuff<00:01:04.750> like<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:04.960> but<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.620> looks

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
stats and stuff like that but it looks

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.070 
stats and stuff like that but it looks
like<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.190> does<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.730> an<00:01:06.940> extremely<00:01:07.540> high<00:01:07.900> rate

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
like it does have an extremely high rate

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.350 
like it does have an extremely high rate
of<00:01:08.140> fire<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:09.190> low<00:01:09.550> impact<00:01:10.030> so<00:01:10.210> this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
of fire and a low impact so this

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.940 
of fire and a low impact so this
probably<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.810> going<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.020> be<00:01:11.140> like<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.800> eighth

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
probably is going to be like the eighth

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.010 
probably is going to be like the eighth
Ian<00:01:12.190> epilogue<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:13.000> that'll<00:01:13.240> be<00:01:13.330> very<00:01:13.600> exciting

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020
