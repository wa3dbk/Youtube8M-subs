00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.170
 November 2013 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.170
 A fierce typhoon hit the Philippines 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.080
 A tragedy was happening under this huge cloud 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.050
 Maximum instantaneous wind speed 90m 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.050
 A storm blows enough to destroy a house 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.989
 Dead missing persons by the damage, such as storm surges has climbed to about 8,000 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:45.629
 The Philippines representative said at a UN meeting to discuss global warming countermeasures 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.380
 Ace at the expense of the high tide typhoon 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:55.900
 It is a performance for those who can no longer talk 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.559
 And I sue for the children who lost their parents 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.739
 Hmm 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.360
 Is the phenomenon that my conflict has experienced 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.379
 p 6 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.909
 I can only say good luck 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:13.109
 September 2013 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.920
 UN Organization Intergovernmental Panel on ipcc Climate Change Researches Scientists Around the World 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.210
 Summarized 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 Announce the latest report 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:28.470
 Now scientists from all over the world analyze huge observation data obtained from the whole of the earth from the ocean to the universe 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 is 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:38.490
 The report seeks to capture the present and future of the earth based on its results 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:49.369
 The report is a violent typhoon No. 8 that has hit the Philippines if global warming progresses 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.369
 Point out that motion increases 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.240
 The average temperature of the Earth has been expected to rise 4.8 degrees by 2100 in the worst case 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.540
 Ha 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.240
 As a result the Arctic and Antarctic ice one after another collapse 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.240
 Melt out 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 Furthermore, the water of the sea is listened to by the rise of the sea water temperature 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:33.819
 A sea level rise of up to 82 cm is predicted in 2100 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.819
 Low sea level coastal areas increase the risk of flood damage such as floods and storm surges 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:47.700
 On land, depending on the location, there is concern over the worsening of drought 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.700
 Lack of agricultural water, food production is greatly affected 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:03:00.130
 The report gives us the main cause of global warming 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:04.180
 Likely to be a carbon dioxide has in association concluded that extremely high 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:12.170
 Probably because there is no doubt that I'm global warming Carry 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:17.530
 Crude oil is the number of human beings who are deforested by burning fossil fuels . 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.530
 We have fundamentally changed the climate of the human race Earth 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.280
 Does human activity bring video anomalies to the earth ? 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.060
 What can we do now? 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.749
 Think based on ipcc's report
