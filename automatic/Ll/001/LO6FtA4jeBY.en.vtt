00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.260
 the student was nicely thanked by AMEC to the Goldberger Year kills the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.160
 Competitions Children us our exciting jump but you have to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.400
 almost say the two-class society ordered by the two Simon Ammann 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.639
 Gregor Schlierenzauer 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.359
 and then all the rest 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.730
 Well, I would see it a bit different 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.760
 I'd make it high-class wine you've got behind the two backs 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.610
 Schlierenzauer ORENCIA behind Ammann you have a package in front of 6 7 absolutely 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.970
 Class Springer they drop off again 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.380
 he had two-tier society me with you Walter Deininger SAF 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.060
 Of course, three-class society can do that again next week 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.370
 very different looking good that the two necessarily break in is not too 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.230
 expect 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.990
 to Germany tour but 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.530
 from the german point of view one must say I have only reminders again in the Top 15 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 So the Internet German in his view in the second or third grade 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.700
 settled 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.940
 One point had to be answered by the judge 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.089
 I also want to try to answer it honestly 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.389
 they are at the top of the third category so let's see you alright then 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.759
 you can still get enough tents almost three weeks in three weeks today in three 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.470
 Weeks is the decision in Vancouver on the small hill 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.479
 To make up for that, the Germans would also jump the Germany tour 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.180
 and we only have the outer dimensions to say this weekend 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 yes I mean the jacket has some nerves Neal's appetite for 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.899
 Germany tour that is obvious 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.899
 with such jumps yesterday today and these weather conditions 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.370
 that is close up front of the Lord and for Olympia anyway ski jumping is 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.250
 and remains a highlight 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.360
 Century and was only their statement Barnett Shale to say but 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.150
 not to point out to our barley juice that we too the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.030
 junior world championships transfer on Thursday and on 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.640
 Friday in Hinterzarten 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.909
 and then set course in Obersdorf prelude sings clock skiflying 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.730
 until then she heard worth listening 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.940
 Gerd Siegmund 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.850
 SchÃ¼tz Euro with us is in a good mood thank you again to the hand me 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.900
 "That should have been such a steady hand and of course we'll see each other then 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.670
