00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 You 'll see, it's rolling from the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.930
 ram I played this week yesterday 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.040
 but let's go then Brazilian championship 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.020
 What happened now in July, I 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.170
 I really wanted to know a lot about you. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.850
 Who did you think because I 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 I was there I was working as 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 right volunteer and I found 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 sensational 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 the structure was beautiful it was huge 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.969
 year had a big problem with the type 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.399
 heat or gets too tight 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.440
 The staff does not have room to sit. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.809
 Of course missing some more chairs. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.369
 Sitting then I found it sensational clear 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 we had some small ones 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.830
 problems with the stupid and time-consuming queue 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 but it was the first major event of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.500
 health here in Brazil so I guess 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.450
