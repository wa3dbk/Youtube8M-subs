 whole and would have bequeathed what drives 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.920
 the bus an axis trick it's the song at 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.660
 departure we wanted to do a concert for 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.550
 children and then we get each time 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.809
 quickly caught up with the stage game finally 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.010
 staging belly songs 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.440
 why school because because we 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 was looking for a theme 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 accessible to kids who talks to everything 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.149
 the world 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 I like the school yes yes that we 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.869
 it seemed like a good door 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.090
 entrance to say what we have to say 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.479
 then children the lizard has 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.850
 of a small is pointed on which 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.200
 are located the eyes of course 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.450
 but also wii both teachers 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 addressing themes songs such as the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 school bus prehistory 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.250
 mathematics or even recreation and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 it is aimed both at children 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.680
 thanks to the rhythm that leads to their 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.479
 parents with little anecdotes 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.860
 of actuality the idea of ​​this show she 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.119
 is in the company's overall idea 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.520
 it is to address everyone 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.520
 and here we think that a young show 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.090
 public who also talks to parents is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.090
 a good thing 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.000
 who will do the most things in less than 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.430
 ten minutes 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.510
 it's a two artists are inspired 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.660
 by their daily 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.980
 we note things from the anecdotes of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.090
 moments of life times there are things 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.490
 that happen in our life or that we 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.630
 the spectators stuff and we say to ourselves 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 well, it would be nice to put 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.990
 on stage there is a theatricality or 1 1 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.760
 how a more humorous party that 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.510
 was done despite the person despite the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.850
 stuff that have the notes and yeah we put 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.490
 on stage what makes us laugh and then 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.890
 after that we try to give it a 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:29.590
 theatrical and musical color that you do not 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.750
