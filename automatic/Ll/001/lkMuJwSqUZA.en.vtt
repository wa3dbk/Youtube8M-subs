00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.719 
101 now what did I start doing after
around<00:01:56.460> 100<00:01:56.850> well<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:58.170> started<00:01:58.500> using<00:01:59.250> sloka

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
around 100 well we started using sloka

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.450 
around 100 well we started using sloka
fire<00:01:59.969> only<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:00.869> around<00:02:01.020> 101<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.280> how

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
fire only just for around 101 to see how

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
fire only just for around 101 to see how
long<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.729> round<00:02:03.149> would<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.439> be

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
long that round would be if it would be

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.080 
long that round would be if it would be
you<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.240> fast<00:02:06.240> short<00:02:06.840> whatever<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.090> that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
you know fast short whatever and that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
you know fast short whatever and that
round<00:02:09.509> ended<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.110> taking<00:02:10.379> quite<00:02:10.979> some<00:02:11.400> time

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
round ended up taking quite some time

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.820 
round ended up taking quite some time
and<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:13.050> had<00:02:13.260> so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and that's because we had so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.540 
and that's because we had so
horrendous<00:02:14.700> box<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.690> oh<00:02:15.900> man<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.160> was

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
horrendous box like oh man it was it was

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.140 
horrendous box like oh man it was it was
so<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.060> bad<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.990> we<00:02:19.290> ended<00:02:19.440> up<00:02:19.590> using<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.720> slow

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
so so bad so we ended up using the slow

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.940 
so so bad so we ended up using the slow
flinger<00:02:24.150> strategy<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.930> whatever<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.680> hell

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
flinger strategy or whatever the hell

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.610 
flinger strategy or whatever the hell
this<00:02:26.160> trap<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.670> called<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.090> forgot<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.380> yeah

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
this trap is called I forgot so yeah

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.110 
this trap is called I forgot so yeah
we've<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.550> started<00:02:29.910> using<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:32.550> wanted

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
we've we started using that and I wanted

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.600 
we've we started using that and I wanted
to<00:02:33.180> run<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> fast<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.560> fast<00:02:34.800> strategy<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.460> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
to run the fast the fast strategy in the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.150 
to run the fast the fast strategy in the
room<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.210> fix<00:02:37.080> who<00:02:37.230> didn't<00:02:37.500> want<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.770> because

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
room but fix who didn't want to because

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.830 
room but fix who didn't want to because
he<00:02:38.190> already<00:02:38.580> had<00:02:38.790> experience<00:02:38.910> running<00:02:39.480> this

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
he already had experience running this

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240 
he already had experience running this
and<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.140> sort<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.410> had<00:02:40.590> some<00:02:40.770> experience

and I sort of had some experience

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.310 
and I sort of had some experience
running<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.640> too<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.270> mean<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.810> was<00:02:42.960> like<00:02:43.050> and

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
running it too so I mean I was like and

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.220 
running it too so I mean I was like and
whatever<00:02:43.860> might<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.310> well<00:02:44.460> just<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.110> know

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
whatever might as well just do you know

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.230 
whatever might as well just do you know
if<00:02:46.470> we're<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:46.890> all<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.370> same<00:02:47.400> page<00:02:47.820> then

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
if we're not all in the same page then

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.390 
if we're not all in the same page then
you<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.050> might<00:02:49.230> as<00:02:49.380> well<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.770> run<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you know we might as well just run a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.280 
you know we might as well just run a
strat<00:02:50.760> where<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.150> are<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> same<00:02:51.810> page<00:02:52.020> so

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
strat where we are on the same page so

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.930 
strat where we are on the same page so
yeah<00:02:52.740> we<00:02:52.890> went<00:02:52.980> ahead<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.280> did<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.880> think

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
yeah we went ahead and did that I think

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.330 
yeah we went ahead and did that I think
that<00:02:54.300> if<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.690> do<00:02:54.930> run<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.170> other<00:02:55.410> strat<00:02:55.830> you

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that if you do run the other strat you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.070 
that if you do run the other strat you
won't<00:02:56.640> G<00:02:56.880> spawn<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.690> what<00:02:57.870> ended

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
won't G spawn because that's what ended

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.260 
won't G spawn because that's what ended
up<00:02:58.200> causing<00:02:58.410> us<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.890> G<00:02:59.070> spawn<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.550> didn't<00:02:59.940> record

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
up causing us to G spawn I didn't record

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.449 
up causing us to G spawn I didn't record
that<00:03:00.480> unfortunately<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.440> fix<00:03:01.740> who<00:03:01.890> did<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.340> if

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
that unfortunately but fix who did so if

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.100 
that unfortunately but fix who did so if
