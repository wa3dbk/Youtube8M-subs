00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the case i have a strong belief that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.090 
the case i have a strong belief that
this<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.530> Daisy's<00:00:37.530> probably<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> come

out at the end of this year and I'll
list<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> reasons<00:00:40.829> why<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.989> think<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
list the reasons why so if you think of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
list the reasons why so if you think of
it<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.680> minecraft<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.820> pc<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it like this minecraft for the pc and it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
it like this minecraft for the pc and it
got<00:00:46.530> transferred<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> xbox<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.660> didn't

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
got transferred to xbox and it didn't

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.389 
got transferred to xbox and it didn't
take<00:00:49.110> too<00:00:49.170> long<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> actually<00:00:49.829> poured<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
take too long to actually poured all the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.110 
take too long to actually poured all the
objects<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> stuff<00:00:51.840> over<00:00:53.000> obviously<00:00:54.000> when

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
objects and stuff over obviously when

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.459 
objects and stuff over obviously when
that<00:00:54.239> started<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.410> minecraft<00:00:56.399> xbox

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
that started and when a minecraft xbox

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
that started and when a minecraft xbox
minecraft<00:00:58.469> came<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.800> xbox<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.670> didn't<00:01:00.510> have

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
minecraft came to xbox it didn't have

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
minecraft came to xbox it didn't have
too<00:01:00.809> many<00:01:00.930> features<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.590> last<00:01:01.829> couple<00:01:02.219> features

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
too many features a last couple features

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
too many features a last couple features
and<00:01:03.090> i<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.329> that's<00:01:03.449> what's<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.019> be

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and i think that's what's going to be

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.329 
and i think that's what's going to be
doing<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.470> Daisy<00:01:04.830> they're<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> start

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
doing with Daisy they're going to start

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
doing with Daisy they're going to start
it<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:05.700> scratch<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it up from scratch and they're going to

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.539 
it up from scratch and they're going to
what<00:01:07.200> gets<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.960> basically<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.549> when

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
what gets way up so basically I'm when

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
what gets way up so basically I'm when
Daisy<00:01:11.790> gets<00:01:12.119> into<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.780> beta<00:01:12.960> stage<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.710> when

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
Daisy gets into the beta stage and when

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
Daisy gets into the beta stage and when
they<00:01:14.010> fix<00:01:14.220> all<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> bugs<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> stuff<00:01:15.720> like

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
they fix all the bugs and stuff like

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.020 
they fix all the bugs and stuff like
that<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.939> think<00:01:17.939> then<00:01:18.530> they're<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> start

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
that I think then they're going to start

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.580 
that I think then they're going to start
developing<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> playstation<00:01:22.320> 4<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
developing it for the playstation 4 and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.160 
developing it for the playstation 4 and
they<00:01:22.710> already<00:01:22.939> announced<00:01:23.939> um<00:01:24.090> i<00:01:24.570> think<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
they already announced um i think in the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.300 
they already announced um i think in the
second<00:01:25.530> quarter<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> year<00:01:25.979> they're

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
second quarter of the year they're

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
second quarter of the year they're
actually<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> start<00:01:27.090> prototyping<00:01:27.710> for

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
actually going to start prototyping for

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.010 
actually going to start prototyping for
consoles<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.460> how<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.970> work<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.689> how

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
consoles see how it will work to see how

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.230 
consoles see how it will work to see how
good<00:01:31.409> how<00:01:32.009> many<00:01:32.189> bugs<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> stuff

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
good how many bugs there are and stuff

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.010 
good how many bugs there are and stuff
like<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.950> every<00:01:34.950> day<00:01:34.979> every<00:01:35.970> week<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
like that and every day every week the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080 
like that and every day every week the
daisy<00:01:37.740> development<00:01:38.490> team<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.759> actually

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
daisy development team is actually

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539 
daisy development team is actually
growing<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> i<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:40.920> watching<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
growing and i was actually watching a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
growing and i was actually watching a
daisy<00:01:41.759> press<00:01:42.360> conference<00:01:42.899> i<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.799> they

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
daisy press conference i think that they

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.670 
daisy press conference i think that they
did<00:01:44.040> at<00:01:44.159> PAX<00:01:44.430> East<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.299> believe<00:01:45.570> or<00:01:45.810> PAX<00:01:46.020> Prime<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
did at PAX East I believe or PAX Prime I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.590 
did at PAX East I believe or PAX Prime I
might<00:01:46.860> have<00:01:46.979> been<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.430> too<00:01:47.579> sure<00:01:47.759> but

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
might have been I'm not too sure but

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.730 
might have been I'm not too sure but
they<00:01:48.689> actually<00:01:48.780> talked<00:01:49.140> about<00:01:49.320> having<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.710> new

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
they actually talked about having a new

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.999 
they actually talked about having a new
renderer<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:51.229> they<00:01:52.229> wanted<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.619> branch<00:01:52.799> out

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
renderer and they wanted to branch out

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
renderer and they wanted to branch out
to<00:01:53.070> consoles<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> would

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to consoles because I think it would

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.670 
to consoles because I think it would
just<00:01:55.229> grow<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.219> community<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.759> lot<00:01:57.090> more<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
just grow the community a lot more and

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.319 
just grow the community a lot more and
