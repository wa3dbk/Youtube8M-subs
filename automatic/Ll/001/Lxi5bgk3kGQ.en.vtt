whole front bumper lip and all that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.840 
whole front bumper lip and all that
whatnot<00:00:33.680> looks<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> little<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:35.100> too<00:00:35.130> racy<00:00:35.489> for

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
whatnot looks a little bit too racy for

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.080

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
diffuser carbon fiber looking and I

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.260 
diffuser carbon fiber looking and I
don't<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.190> want<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> paint<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.000> we're

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
don't really want to paint it so we're

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
don't really want to paint it so we're
leaving<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.540> off<00:00:43.010> arty<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.219> level<00:00:44.430> 4

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
leaving that off arty have the level 4

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.350 
leaving that off arty have the level 4
engine<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.370> hood<00:00:47.550> already<00:00:47.850> has<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> vent

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
engine and the hood already has a vent

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
engine and the hood already has a vent
in<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:48.960> really<00:00:49.170> need<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> second<00:00:49.860> vent

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
in it I don't really need a second vent

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.670 
in it I don't really need a second vent
so<00:00:50.430> we're<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.730> leave<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.940> alone<00:00:51.620> as<00:00:52.620> far

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so we're gonna leave that alone as far

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.299 
so we're gonna leave that alone as far
as<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.610> exhausts<00:00:54.270> go<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.350> car<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.039> pass

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
as the exhausts go on the car as I pass

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.720 
as the exhausts go on the car as I pass
it<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.640> by<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> mile<00:00:57.360> whoops

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it up by like a mile whoops

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
it up by like a mile whoops
actually<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> stock<00:01:01.289> exhaust<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.920> lot

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
actually I like the stock exhaust a lot

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.350 
actually I like the stock exhaust a lot
on<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.520> car<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.210> fits<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.870> well<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
on this car it just fits so well and the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880 
on this car it just fits so well and the
only<00:01:06.479> other<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.229> fits<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> race

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
only other one that fits is the race

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800 
only other one that fits is the race
exhaust<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.180> want<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> blue

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
exhaust but I don't really want the blue

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.730 
exhaust but I don't really want the blue
tips<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.920> we're<00:01:11.700> gonna<00:01:11.790> leave<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.119> alone

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
tips so we're gonna leave it alone

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.300 
tips so we're gonna leave it alone
as<00:01:13.880> far<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:16.140> roof<00:01:16.320> goes<00:01:16.560> put<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> little

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
as far as the roof goes put a little

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.920 
as far as the roof goes put a little
roof<00:01:17.520> scoop<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> why<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.659> look<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
roof scoop on it why not make it look a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.710 
roof scoop on it why not make it look a
little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> p1<00:01:19.920> McLaren

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
little bit more like the p1 McLaren

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.359 
little bit more like the p1 McLaren
considering<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.130> car

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
considering I think that's what this car

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.219 
considering I think that's what this car
is<00:01:23.490> meant<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.689> an<00:01:24.869> mp4-12c

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is meant to be it's like an mp4-12c

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
is meant to be it's like an mp4-12c
mixed<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> p1<00:01:26.850> mixed<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.299> something

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
mixed with a p1 mixed with something

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.030 
mixed with a p1 mixed with something
else<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.590> though<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> shark

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
else I don't know what though the shark

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.710 
else I don't know what though the shark
fins<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.610> dumb<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.210> car<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.600> we're

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
fins just like dumb on this car so we're

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.170 
fins just like dumb on this car so we're
leaving<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.079> off<00:01:34.909> start<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
leaving those off start to get the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.580 
leaving those off start to get the
racing<00:01:36.479> transmission<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.619> turbo<00:01:37.920> tuning
