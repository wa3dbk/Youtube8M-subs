00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:03.239 
hey it's me again in this video we're

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:04.400 
hey it's me again in this video we're
going<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.389> talk<00:00:03.479> about<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.840> amazing<00:00:04.080> gall

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
going to talk about the amazing gall

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.400 
going to talk about the amazing gall
bladder<00:00:04.620> part<00:00:05.010> 4<00:00:05.880> okay<00:00:06.570> so<00:00:06.630> this<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.110> the<00:00:07.230> last

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
bladder part 4 okay so this is the last

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.739 
bladder part 4 okay so this is the last
video<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:07.860> the<00:00:07.950> series<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.419> there's<00:00:09.419> a<00:00:09.480> couple

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:09.749 
video in the series and there's a couple

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:11.060 
video in the series and there's a couple
more<00:00:09.870> things<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.320> want<00:00:10.499> to<00:00:10.559> share<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:10.950> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
more things I want to share with you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.879 
more things I want to share with you
number<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.419> gall<00:00:12.629> bladder<00:00:12.889> releases

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
number one the gall bladder releases

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.859 
number one the gall bladder releases
bile<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.249> helps<00:00:14.610> break<00:00:14.759> down<00:00:14.820> fat<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.749> it

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
bile that helps break down fat but it

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.540 
bile that helps break down fat but it
doesn't<00:00:16.200> break<00:00:16.410> down<00:00:16.440> fat<00:00:16.949> all<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> way<00:00:17.490> to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
doesn't break down fat all the way to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.050 
doesn't break down fat all the way to
the<00:00:17.820> smallest<00:00:18.359> particle<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.529> meets<00:00:20.039> helped<00:00:20.460> by

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the smallest particle it meets helped by

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.910 
the smallest particle it meets helped by
this<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.779> called<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.170> pancreas<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
this thing called the pancreas the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.769 
this thing called the pancreas the
pancreas<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> gall<00:00:24.269> bladder<00:00:24.300> work

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
pancreas and the gall bladder work

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.040 
pancreas and the gall bladder work
together<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.740> break<00:00:25.980> down<00:00:26.250> these<00:00:26.400> fats<00:00:26.759> so<00:00:27.300> if

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
together to break down these fats so if

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.189 
together to break down these fats so if
you<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:28.980> substituting<00:00:29.609> bile<00:00:30.419> into<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> diet

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you are substituting bile into the diet

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
you are substituting bile into the diet
or<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.499> purify<00:00:31.949> bile<00:00:32.099> salt<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:33.329> doesn't

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
or a purify bile salt and it doesn't

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.170 
or a purify bile salt and it doesn't
fully<00:00:34.410> solve<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> problem<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> could<00:00:36.000> mean

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
fully solve the problem it could mean

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
fully solve the problem it could mean
that<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> pancreas<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.260> releasing

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that the pancreas is not releasing

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.750 
that the pancreas is not releasing
enzymes<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.750> symptoms<00:00:40.289> of

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
enzymes because the symptoms of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
enzymes because the symptoms of
pancreatic<00:00:41.760> enzyme<00:00:42.210> deficiencies<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.140> very

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
pancreatic enzyme deficiencies are very

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.189 
pancreatic enzyme deficiencies are very
similar<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.730> gallbladder<00:00:45.120> deficiency<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
similar to a gallbladder deficiency or a

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.260 
similar to a gallbladder deficiency or a
bile<00:00:46.620> deficiency<00:00:47.160> okay<00:00:47.699> so<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> kind

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
bile deficiency okay so you have to kind

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
bile deficiency okay so you have to kind
of<00:00:48.359> understand<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.050> there<00:00:49.770> could<00:00:49.949> be<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
of understand that there could be that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.680 
of understand that there could be that
too<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.879> both<00:00:51.000> work<00:00:51.210> together<00:00:51.359> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
too because they both work together so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.459 
too because they both work together so
this<00:00:52.199> pancreas<00:00:52.769> makes<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.910> fat<00:00:54.660> enzyme<00:00:55.170> called

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
this pancreas makes a fat enzyme called

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.889 
this pancreas makes a fat enzyme called
lipase<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.120> works<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.719> help

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
lipase and that really works to help

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.799 
lipase and that really works to help
take<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.670> break<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> fat<00:01:00.179> all<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> way

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
take that break down a fat all the way

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
take that break down a fat all the way
down<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> smallest<00:01:01.649> particle<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> can

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
down to the smallest particle so you can

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.299 
down to the smallest particle so you can
start<00:01:02.969> absorbing<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.660> start<00:01:03.840> using<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.309> so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
start absorbing it and start using it so

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.690 
start absorbing it and start using it so
that's<00:01:05.670> very<00:01:05.939> important<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:07.259> also<00:01:07.920> there's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that's very important now also there's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
that's very important now also there's
some<00:01:08.880> studies<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.420> show<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> having

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
some studies that show that having

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
some studies that show that having
enough<00:01:10.920> bio<00:01:11.189> will<00:01:11.549> prevent<00:01:12.200> fibrosis<00:01:13.200> now

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
enough bio will prevent fibrosis now

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.300 
enough bio will prevent fibrosis now
what<00:01:13.500> does<00:01:13.590> fibrosis

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
what does fibrosis

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
what does fibrosis
that's<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> scar<00:01:15.090> tissue<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> builds<00:01:15.810> up<00:01:15.900> on

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's the scar tissue that builds up on

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.740 
that's the scar tissue that builds up on
the<00:01:16.110> liver<00:01:16.380> fibrosis<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> soft<00:01:18.420> tissues

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
the liver fibrosis of the soft tissues

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.289 
the liver fibrosis of the soft tissues
it's<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.619> flex<00:01:19.860> scar<00:01:20.189> tissue<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.150> like

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it's like the flex scar tissue it's like

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140 
it's like the flex scar tissue it's like
a<00:01:22.070> connective<00:01:23.070> tissue<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.119> of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a connective tissue that just kind of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.140 
a connective tissue that just kind of
plugs<00:01:24.450> everything<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.880> want<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
plugs everything up so I just want to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.280 
plugs everything up so I just want to
point<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.600> because<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.140> have

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
point that out because if you have

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.310 
point that out because if you have
fibrosis<00:01:29.240> one<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> things<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.020> found

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
fibrosis one of the things that I found

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.480 
fibrosis one of the things that I found
when<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.530> doing<00:01:31.710> research<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.250> take

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
when I'm doing research if you take

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.370 
when I'm doing research if you take
purify<00:01:32.850> bile<00:01:33.090> salts<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.990> improve<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
purify bile salts that can improve that

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.780 
purify bile salts that can improve that
condition<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> might<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> do

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
condition so you might want to do

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
condition so you might want to do
research<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.390> area

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
research in that area

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.330 
research in that area
next<00:01:37.799> thing<00:01:37.890> we're<00:01:38.009> talking<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
next thing we're talking about is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
next thing we're talking about is
cholesterol<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:39.360> people<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.840> freaked<00:01:40.259> out

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
cholesterol now people are freaked out

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.289 
cholesterol now people are freaked out
because<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.860> cholesterol<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.119> don't

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
because of cholesterol but they don't

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.789 
because of cholesterol but they don't
understand<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.960> cholesterol<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> they

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
understand what cholesterol is they

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
understand what cholesterol is they
think<00:01:44.130> cholesterol<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> fat<00:01:45.180> cholesterol

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
think cholesterol is a fat cholesterol

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.310

actually<00:02:06.329> help<00:02:06.689> heal<00:02:08.000> parts<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.150> the<00:02:09.240> body<00:02:09.480> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
actually help heal parts of the body so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500 
actually help heal parts of the body so
there's<00:02:10.230> some<00:02:10.500> type<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:11.360> inflammation<00:02:12.360> in

there's some type of inflammation in
your<00:02:12.540> arteries

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
your arteries

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.690 
your arteries
it's<00:02:14.019> called<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> lesion<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:15.430> cholesterol

it's called the lesion that cholesterol

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's called the lesion that cholesterol
will<00:02:16.000> come<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.330> there<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.629> start<00:02:16.810> healing<00:02:17.019> up

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
will come in there and start healing up

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.190 
will come in there and start healing up
like<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.500> band-aid<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:19.480> you'd<00:02:19.659> understand

like a band-aid and if you'd understand
that<00:02:20.319> you're<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.769> think<00:02:21.069> that<00:02:21.250> oh<00:02:21.400> my

gosh my cholesterol is too high I'm
going<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.069> get<00:02:24.190> clogged<00:02:24.430> arteries<00:02:24.940> when

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
going to get clogged arteries when

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.630 
going to get clogged arteries when
really<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:25.870> trying<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.290> heal<00:02:26.709> your

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
really it's just trying to heal your

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.399 
really it's just trying to heal your
arteries<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.540> you've<00:02:28.870> eaten<00:02:29.019> too<00:02:29.200> much

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
arteries because you've eaten too much

arteries because you've eaten too much
sugar<00:02:29.769> or<00:02:29.860> junk<00:02:30.220> food<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.110> cholesterol<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.170> not

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
sugar or junk food so cholesterol is not

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.229 
sugar or junk food so cholesterol is not
a<00:02:32.349> bad<00:02:32.620> thing<00:02:32.799> it's<00:02:32.980> likely<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.640> just<00:02:33.970> tells

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
a bad thing it's likely it just tells

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.490 
a bad thing it's likely it just tells
you<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.659> body<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.049> trying<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.409> heal

bile it's needed to make stress hormones
I<00:03:08.200> mean<00:03:08.680> think<00:03:08.859> about<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.040> your<00:03:09.340> liver<00:03:09.609> makes

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I mean think about it your liver makes

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.690 
I mean think about it your liver makes
2,000<00:03:12.329> milligrams<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.780> cholesterol<00:03:14.700> every

2,000 milligrams of cholesterol every

2,000 milligrams of cholesterol every
single<00:03:16.150> day<00:03:16.569> why<00:03:17.379> does<00:03:17.799> your<00:03:17.950> body<00:03:18.069> make<00:03:18.519> that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
single day why does your body make that

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.819 
single day why does your body make that
much<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.419> it's<00:03:20.319> bad<00:03:20.769> it's<00:03:21.669> not<00:03:21.940> bad<00:03:22.380> it's<00:03:23.380> good

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
much if it's bad it's not bad it's good

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.699 
much if it's bad it's not bad it's good
and<00:03:24.099> because<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.090> actually<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:26.440> good<00:03:26.620> in

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
and because it actually is it's good in

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.740 
and because it actually is it's good in
the<00:03:26.739> right<00:03:26.950> ratio<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:27.639> we<00:03:27.669> you<00:03:28.359> shouldn't<00:03:28.690> be

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
the right ratio so we you shouldn't be

cholesterol<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.889> a<00:03:48.099> very<00:03:48.579> important<00:03:48.970> point

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
cholesterol so a very important point

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.140 
cholesterol so a very important point
okay<00:03:50.139> another<00:03:50.410> point<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:51.190> your<00:03:51.609> thyroid

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
okay another point in your thyroid

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.559 
okay another point in your thyroid
thyroid<00:03:53.139> produces<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.859> hormone<00:03:54.250> called<00:03:54.639> t4<00:03:55.299> and

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
thyroid produces a hormone called t4 and

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.080 
thyroid produces a hormone called t4 and
a<00:03:56.169> lot<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.379> times<00:03:56.560> women<00:03:56.739> take<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:57.790> take

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
a lot of times women take and then take

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.530 
a lot of times women take and then take
synthroid<00:03:59.019> that's<00:03:59.379> t4<00:04:00.099> that's<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.940> inactive

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
synthroid that's t4 that's the inactive

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.390 
synthroid that's t4 that's the inactive
form<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:02.019> thyroid<00:04:02.379> hormone<00:04:02.709> well<00:04:03.129> did<00:04:03.280> you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
form of thyroid hormone well did you

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.490 
form of thyroid hormone well did you
know<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:04.060> gets<00:04:04.510> converted<00:04:04.989> through

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
know that that gets converted through

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.330 
know that that gets converted through
the<00:04:06.250> liver<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:07.150> t3<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:08.919> don't<00:04:09.129> have

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the liver to t3 but if you don't have

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.360 
the liver to t3 but if you don't have
enough<00:04:09.669> bile<00:04:10.239> you<00:04:10.780> can't<00:04:11.079> convert<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:11.889> so<00:04:12.340> a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
enough bile you can't convert it so a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.210 
enough bile you can't convert it so a
lot<00:04:12.579> of<00:04:12.730> times<00:04:12.940> your<00:04:13.150> thyroid<00:04:13.599> problem<00:04:13.989> is

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
lot of times your thyroid problem is

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.289 
lot of times your thyroid problem is
really<00:04:15.220> not<00:04:15.489> a<00:04:15.549> thyroid<00:04:15.970> problem

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
really not a thyroid problem

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.390 
really not a thyroid problem
it's<00:04:16.449> a<00:04:16.630> gallbladder<00:04:16.900> liver<00:04:17.380> problem<00:04:18.160> because

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
it's a gallbladder liver problem because

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.060 
it's a gallbladder liver problem because
the<00:04:18.579> conversion<00:04:19.269> isn't<00:04:19.479> there<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.709> here<00:04:20.919> you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
the conversion isn't there so here you

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.690 
the conversion isn't there so here you
are<00:04:21.810> taking<00:04:22.810> all<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.409> synthroid<00:04:24.099> for<00:04:24.490> years

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
are taking all this synthroid for years

and years and not seeing any results

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.950 
and years and not seeing any results
because<00:04:26.320> the

telling you the importance of the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.870 
telling you the importance of the
gallbladder<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.680> it's<00:04:40.370> huge

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
gallbladder is it's huge

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.480 
gallbladder is it's huge
okay<00:04:41.569> there's<00:04:42.560> there's<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:43.009> couple<00:04:43.220> things

okay there's there's a couple things

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.719 
okay there's there's a couple things
that<00:04:43.789> can<00:04:44.000> cause<00:04:44.569> this<00:04:45.250> gallbladder<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.340> the

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
that can cause this gallbladder and the

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.589 
that can cause this gallbladder and the
duck<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.240> be<00:04:47.740> smaller<00:04:48.740> or<00:04:49.130> pinched<00:04:50.090> off<00:04:50.270> and

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
duck to be smaller or pinched off and

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.629 
duck to be smaller or pinched off and
that<00:04:51.289> could<00:04:51.500> be<00:04:51.620> stressed<00:04:52.099> because<00:04:52.310> high

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
that could be stressed because high

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.290 
that could be stressed because high
level<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.060> cortisol<00:04:53.569> going<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.080> system<00:04:54.470> or

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
level of cortisol going in the system or

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.450 
level of cortisol going in the system or
estrogen<00:04:56.300> too<00:04:56.960> much<00:04:57.139> estrogen<00:04:57.410> can<00:04:57.830> also<00:04:57.979> mess

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
estrogen too much estrogen can also mess

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.040 
estrogen too much estrogen can also mess
up<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.819> gallbladder<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.479> that's<00:04:59.840> why

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
up the gallbladder and that's why

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.170 
up the gallbladder and that's why
females<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.800> take<00:05:01.220> hormone<00:05:01.699> replacement

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
females that take hormone replacement

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.870 
females that take hormone replacement
therapy<00:05:02.570> or<00:05:02.810> even<00:05:03.500> birth<00:05:03.770> control<00:05:04.130> pills<00:05:04.400> or

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
therapy or even birth control pills or

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.060 
therapy or even birth control pills or
even<00:05:05.509> go<00:05:06.110> through<00:05:06.289> a<00:05:06.320> pregnancy<00:05:06.560> when<00:05:06.979> they

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
even go through a pregnancy when they

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.640 
even go through a pregnancy when they
have<00:05:07.220> this<00:05:07.370> huge<00:05:07.910> spike<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.570> estrogen<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.199> the

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
have this huge spike of estrogen and the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.990 
have this huge spike of estrogen and the
end<00:05:09.800> up<00:05:09.889> with<00:05:09.919> a<00:05:10.070> gall<00:05:10.250> bladder<00:05:10.280> problem<00:05:10.849> well

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
end up with a gall bladder problem well

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.969 
end up with a gall bladder problem well
guess<00:05:11.150> where<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.449> came<00:05:11.570> from<00:05:11.979> excessive

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
guess where it came from excessive

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.890 
guess where it came from excessive
estrogen<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:16.060> then<00:05:17.060> people<00:05:17.330> have<00:05:17.509> questions

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
estrogen and then people have questions

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.540 
estrogen and then people have questions
about<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.620> gall<00:05:18.770> bladder<00:05:18.800> formula<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.460> have

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
about the gall bladder formula I have

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.249 
about the gall bladder formula I have
I'm<00:05:19.849> just<00:05:19.880> going<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.150> tell<00:05:20.360> you<00:05:20.509> what's<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:21.080> it

this is an extra-strength version I just

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.110 
this is an extra-strength version I just
added<00:05:24.650> a<00:05:24.860> new<00:05:24.979> ingredient<00:05:25.009> because<00:05:25.729> I<00:05:25.819> wanted

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
added a new ingredient because I wanted

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.860 
added a new ingredient because I wanted
to<00:05:26.240> add<00:05:26.389> all<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:27.650> pancreatic<00:05:28.430> enzymes<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.750> it

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
to add all the pancreatic enzymes so it

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.460 
to add all the pancreatic enzymes so it
has<00:05:30.550> pancreas<00:05:31.550> enzymes<00:05:32.180> pancreas<00:05:32.840> enzymes<00:05:33.199> it

has pancreas enzymes pancreas enzymes it

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.270 
has pancreas enzymes pancreas enzymes it
has<00:05:33.650> purify<00:05:34.520> bile<00:05:34.729> salts<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.990> has<00:05:36.320> the<00:05:37.039> Tang

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280
