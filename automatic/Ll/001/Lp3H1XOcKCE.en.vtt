using<00:03:04.880> but<00:03:05.630> honestly<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.410> couldn't<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.980> easier

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
using but honestly it couldn't be easier

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.030 
using but honestly it couldn't be easier
so<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:08.299> we're<00:03:08.420> going<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.570> do<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.049> is<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.440> add
