00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.360
 Hello 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.759
 Today we introduce you to schmidt 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 Play the game shapes and colors learn 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.150
 and fun before 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.060
 This is for children from 3 to 6 years 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.520
 suitable and we'll show you now 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.269
 what is there and that four different 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.800
 tables with basically eight pictures because 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.000
 if you turn it over on the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 back still another picture 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.770
 still has to turn around what else is on it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 let someone fly a kite 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.620
 and we have four different colors 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:51.390
 each with four different form what 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:59.100
 is it 34 exactly and what color 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:01.859
 is the red-blue super and there are 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.040
 two dice and you can now completely 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.680
 just play first for example 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.869
 that I'm the kid just this blackboard 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.549
 take and the suitable 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.490
 no matter which side you have 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.140
 want and the right shapes here 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.740
 Just put it in and then for example 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.240
 He is now so the green circle the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 is the red hexagon or you can too 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.380
 two play each one or takes 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.360
 two tables 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.259
 that's handy for up to four 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.259
 player thought 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.150
 and then you give me two dice once 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.800
 with the shapes and once with the colors 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.620
 then you can then the simpler variant 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.580
 Take for example now only the color 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.490
 to obtain 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.590
 Of course, the joker is valid for that 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.150
 what you want to choose or you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:05.570
 Both use the recent effect 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.560
 dice exactly what is that now can 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.740
 you need that 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.550
 yes , I can be a red square 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.550
 not use 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.050
 It's your turn I keep it you can 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.910
 I need that but I have that 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.680
 diced headlines there are 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.840
 different game variants then you are 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.080
 but now dran to dice 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.080
 joker 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.830
 you can choose the color but 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.489
 you need a square and you 're missing 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.910
 only the blue so I would 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:50.870
 I'm taking a lukewarm square now 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:58.130
 Wore a red hexagon believe it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:01.690
 it's your turn and you know it 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.600
 again a joker as a life saver 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.600
 but you are thankyou but love pressure 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.600

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:22.310

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.930

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.470
 Hurry if you want to win dice

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:27.180
 colors yellow and green 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:32.250
 I do not need what I need it 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:42.419

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:50.720
 okay now for you again a red 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:05:01.650
 triangle or I'm sorry 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:03.360
 you're good then I have that now 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.340
 made for you because you have 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.729
 a yellow circle and can also 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.729
 make progress 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.300
 do you have a clear you can take what you 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:25.639

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:29.599
 homer your turn maybe you should 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:33.139
 we only throw dice with the colors 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:35.089
 hanna okay maybe it will be easier 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.879
 The first green cube is allowed to grow 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:39.259
 to take 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:43.129
 but I also need green 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:49.699
 it's supposed to be green at all yes me 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:51.009
 I'm also still green so quiet the 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:55.749
 warned me 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:06:06.409
 then I would start it was that 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:07.369
 horrible as hannah gmbh does 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:12.949
 won 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:14.509
 great you see you are not on 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.569
 any rules necessarily 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:23.419
 become tied 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:27.139
 but it brings fun or do you say maria 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.120
 in short, the game is not just fun 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.490
 but next to learning the shapes 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.209
 and colors will also be at the same time 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.870
 the fine motor skills a bit until the 

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:37.870
 next time 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:54.340
 the fine motor by the fact that the 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:57.520
 also at the beginning and next to learning 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.060
 it also promotes shapes and colors 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.060
 fine motor skills 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.610
 the game not only brings fun
