00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.850
 in the diesel &amp; turbo has with the lgt 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.170
 series a gas turbine family 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.389
 they created the location 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.620
 Oberhausen developed from scratch 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.289
 has the high-efficiency turbines mgt 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.750
 6100 and mgt 6200 are a milestone 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.750
 in the 6 megawatt performance class 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.320
 Let's first look at the MBT 6200 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.480
 turbines 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.939
 she is a 2 weller of the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 mechanical applications, for example 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.530
 Compressors serve the compact core 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 machine makes a maximum of 6 9 megawatts 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 that equates to 9522 ps as much as 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.230
 95 car engines with 100 ps each 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.230
 work together 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.560
 Essentially, the MBT 6200 is made up 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.290
 two sections with the gas generator 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.150
 high pressure turbine to the left and the nuz 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.060
 power or low-pressure turbine 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.040
 to the right the thanks to a second wave 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.040
 regardless of the gas generator with 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.080
 variable speed runs an external 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.479
 drive starts the gas turbine in this 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.460
 case it is an electric motor of the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.130
 shaft of the high-pressure turbine drives and 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.920
 with her the attached 11 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.060
 stage axial compressor 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.369
 the one of the high pressure turbine 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.320
 driven compressor is used for this 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.790
 air needed for combustion to 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.590
 suck and compact 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 the six combustion chambers mix the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.030
 air with fuel gas and ignite the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.740
 mix the hot exhaust gases expand 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.130
 drive high as well 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.360
 low-pressure turbine on 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.430
 Let's see this process in detail 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.020
 to the blades of the axial compressor 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.030
 hit by the rotary motion on the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.399
 air pass it into the turbine and 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.990
 compress it so builds a 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.759
 flow on through the air 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.819
 entrance housing and then 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.289
 along the axis runs at 15 bar 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.000
 and open with it and 15 times more 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.740
 Oxygen poured air into the six 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 combustion chambers these sophisticated 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.940
 advanced kern komposter mix the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.190
 compressed air already enters before 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.770
 the combustion chamber is homogeneous before then 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.060
 inflamed mixture burned optimally and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.060
 with very low pollutant emissions 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.010
 the firing glass air mixture applies 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.050
 through the heat of combustion on one 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.040
 many times its volume from it 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.170
 it flows at high speed 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.240
 first through the two shovels 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.160
 rows of high pressure and then 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.530
 through which the low pressure or use 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 power turbine and so drives both 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.190
 waves to the exhaust gases flow through one 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.230
 diffuser into the outlet housing their 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.120
 high temperature of around 460 degrees 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.880
 celsius can still be used afterwards 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.470
 For example, to generate steam, the wave 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.230
 the nuz power turbine can 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.290
 regardless of the generator in 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.830
 a speed range of 45 to 105 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.150
 percent of the nominal speed of 12,600 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.310
 revolutions per minute 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.900
 and thus optimally to the 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.830
 requirements to be met 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.930
 adapt machine 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.820
 to generate electricity is such a 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.480
 flexible speed range but not 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.970
 necessary for this is the mdt 6100 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 designed this rhine wave drives with 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.140
 constant speed an electric 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:15.180
 generator on is special for this 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.010
 designed and optimized the mbt 6100 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.160
 shares many modular assemblies 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.160
 the lgt 6200 about the combustion chambers 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.400
 or compacted the axia 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.650
 however, here comes only one 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.200
 continuous balls for use with it 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.770
 black and 27 percent of items 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.610
 It consists of 7846 components 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.750
 while the mdt 6200 out of 10,000 eleven 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.750
 to share 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.980
 since 1988 at m &amp; a in diesel &amp; turbo 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.870
 gas turbines 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.790
 the mdt series is the youngest 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.010
 the result of many years of experience 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.560
 with high mechanical efficiencies of 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.420
 over 30% and extremely low 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.549
 pollutant emissions offers that 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 make future secure and secure 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.549
 clean drives compressors and 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.549
 generators
