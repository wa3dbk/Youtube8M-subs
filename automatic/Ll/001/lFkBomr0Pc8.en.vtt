00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
yeah that's bad but not as bad as

small words on it I don't know about you
but<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.380> think<00:03:41.680> we<00:03:41.740> have<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.890> problem

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
but I think we have a problem

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.910 
but I think we have a problem
as<00:03:42.520> morbid<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.510> horrible<00:03:43.990> as<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.380> sounds

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
as morbid and horrible as the sounds

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.310 
as morbid and horrible as the sounds
morbid<00:03:45.310> bull<00:03:45.640> if<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:45.880> will<00:03:46.240> I<00:03:46.510> hope<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.110> one

day<00:04:17.380> it'll<00:04:17.770> start<00:04:18.070> thinking<00:04:18.459> on<00:04:18.549> its<00:04:18.760> own

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
day it'll start thinking on its own

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.180

it'll<00:04:19.480> start<00:04:19.780> thinking<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.380> realize<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.070> we

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
it'll start thinking and realize that we

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.100 
it'll start thinking and realize that we
only<00:04:21.220> built<00:04:21.669> them<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.090> be<00:04:22.240> our<00:04:22.360> slaves<00:04:22.750> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
only built them to be our slaves and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.920 
only built them to be our slaves and
then<00:04:23.440> they'll<00:04:23.710> be<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:23.860> screw<00:04:24.640> this<00:04:24.669> must

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
then they'll be like screw this must

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.499 
then they'll be like screw this must
