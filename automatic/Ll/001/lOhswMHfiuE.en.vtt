00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
to detect detachable parts which

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
to detect detachable parts which
actually<00:01:23.880> joined<00:01:24.299> together<00:01:24.509> when<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
actually joined together when was the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.280 
actually joined together when was the
joystick<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.979> one<00:01:26.100> must<00:01:26.220> be<00:01:26.400> throttle<00:01:27.290> that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.130 
joystick and one must be throttle that
was<00:01:28.409> pretty<00:01:28.560> cool<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.549> not<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140

the<00:05:05.550> base<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.479> USB<00:05:06.720> cable<00:05:06.979> so<00:05:07.979> it's

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
the base is just the USB cable so it's

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.580 
the base is just the USB cable so it's
pretty<00:05:08.370> awesome<00:05:08.580> this<00:05:08.849> is<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.590> obviously

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
pretty awesome this is the obviously

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.080 
pretty awesome this is the obviously
where<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.830> attach<00:05:10.949> it<00:05:11.310> you've<00:05:11.789> got<00:05:11.880> some

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
where you attach it you've got some

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.870 
where you attach it you've got some
buttons<00:05:12.570> over<00:05:12.750> here<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.199> bottom<00:05:13.880> small

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
buttons over here the bottom small

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.330 
buttons over here the bottom small
buttons<00:05:15.180> they're<00:05:15.360> all<00:05:15.449> programmable<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:17.280> of

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
buttons they're all programmable and of

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.820 
buttons they're all programmable and of
course<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:17.880> have<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.300> actual<00:05:18.830> joystick

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
course you have the actual joystick

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.529 
course you have the actual joystick
itself<00:05:20.220> so<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:20.880> obviously<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.300> trigger

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
itself so you obviously have a trigger

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.850 
itself so you obviously have a trigger
button<00:05:21.840> or<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:21.990> brake<00:05:22.260> button<00:05:22.530> over<00:05:22.830> here

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
button or the brake button over here

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.879 
button or the brake button over here
then<00:05:23.820> you<00:05:23.970> have<00:05:24.139> some<00:05:25.139> buttons<00:05:25.440> over<00:05:25.560> here<00:05:25.680> you

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
then you have some buttons over here you

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.240 
then you have some buttons over here you
have<00:05:25.949> one<00:05:26.639> two<00:05:27.120> three<00:05:27.780> four<00:05:28.199> buttons<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:29.190> know

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
have one two three four buttons you know

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
this part which connects on to the base

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:52.550 
this part which connects on to the base
which<00:05:49.080> I'll<00:05:49.229> show<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.500> now<00:05:50.599> so<00:05:51.599> right<00:05:52.020> here

which I'll show you now so right here
you<00:05:52.590> can<00:05:52.830> see<00:05:53.090> you<00:05:54.090> pretty<00:05:54.360> much<00:05:54.419> from<00:05:55.020> what

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
you can see you pretty much from what

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.980 
you can see you pretty much from what
I've<00:05:55.260> seen<00:05:55.289> in<00:05:55.590> other<00:05:55.860> videos<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.750> believe<00:05:57.750> this

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
I've seen in other videos I believe this

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.980 
I've seen in other videos I believe this
is<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.199> front<00:05:58.560> yeah<00:05:59.430> this<00:05:59.580> is<00:05:59.729> the<00:05:59.820> front<00:06:00.060> so

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
is the front yeah this is the front so

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.490 
is the front yeah this is the front so
what<00:06:01.110> you<00:06:01.229> pretty<00:06:01.470> much<00:06:01.530> do<00:06:01.800> is<00:06:02.070> you<00:06:02.820> just

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
what you pretty much do is you just

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.520 
what you pretty much do is you just
connect<00:06:04.500> it<00:06:04.620> here<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:05.240> then<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:07.050> just<00:06:07.199> turn

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
connect it here and then you just turn

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.890 
connect it here and then you just turn
it<00:06:07.710> at<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:07.949> bottom<00:06:08.539> alright<00:06:09.539> so<00:06:09.779> that's

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
it at the bottom alright so that's

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.440 
it at the bottom alright so that's
assembled<00:06:10.529> now<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:11.070> but<00:06:11.969> most<00:06:12.150> of<00:06:12.300> you<00:06:12.389> are

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
assembled now and but most of you are

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:13.790 
assembled now and but most of you are
probably<00:06:12.510> thinking

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
probably thinking

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.830 
probably thinking
why<00:06:14.009> is<00:06:14.069> the<00:06:14.370> throttle<00:06:14.819> you<00:06:15.090> know<00:06:15.539> on<00:06:15.810> a

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
why is the throttle you know on a

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.010 
why is the throttle you know on a
horizontal<00:06:17.030> axis<00:06:18.030> well<00:06:18.300> this<00:06:18.690> is<00:06:18.870> on<00:06:18.990> a

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
horizontal axis well this is on a

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.050 
horizontal axis well this is on a
vertical<00:06:19.259> axis<00:06:19.860> I've<00:06:20.370> never<00:06:20.490> seen<00:06:20.610> too<00:06:20.940> many

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
vertical axis I've never seen too many

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.670 
vertical axis I've never seen too many
joysticks<00:06:21.599> with<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.900> throttle<00:06:22.560> and

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
joysticks with the throttle and

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.920 
joysticks with the throttle and
horizontal<00:06:23.340> axis<00:06:23.639> will<00:06:24.270> actually<00:06:24.810> look<00:06:26.930> it

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
horizontal axis will actually look it

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.839 
horizontal axis will actually look it
kind<00:06:28.259> of<00:06:28.379> transformed<00:06:29.370> I<00:06:29.490> mean<00:06:29.610> it<00:06:29.729> is<00:06:29.759> a

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
kind of transformed I mean it is a

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.589 
kind of transformed I mean it is a
cyborg<00:06:30.419> sort<00:06:31.289> of<00:06:31.349> joystick<00:06:31.830> so<00:06:32.009> it<00:06:32.599> transforms

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
cyborg sort of joystick so it transforms

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.920 
cyborg sort of joystick so it transforms
into<00:06:33.780> this<00:06:33.930> awesome<00:06:34.940> t-shape<00:06:35.940> over<00:06:36.750> base

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
into this awesome t-shape over base

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.379 
into this awesome t-shape over base
which<00:06:37.680> is<00:06:37.889> pretty<00:06:38.069> sturdy<00:06:38.430> you<00:06:39.090> don't<00:06:39.240> need

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
which is pretty sturdy you don't need

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.850 
which is pretty sturdy you don't need
any<00:06:39.629> suction<00:06:39.960> cups<00:06:40.319> at<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.500> bottom<00:06:40.740> or

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
any suction cups at the bottom or

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.430 
any suction cups at the bottom or
anything<00:06:41.159> so<00:06:41.789> that's<00:06:41.970> really<00:06:42.120> nice<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:42.720> i
