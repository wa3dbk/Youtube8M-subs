00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.480
 with a little unboxing very short me 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.890
 mister of the rings buys easily 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:34.829
 can recognize in this version 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:40.079
 The whole has cost 39 eur 95 with 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.899
 board is the meadow box here with all 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.239
 film in the exhibition so 726 running time 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:51.840
 the same duration as the dvd 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.680
 Excellent versions the big external 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.609
 box this golden too often 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.050
 blood gives two pads 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.629
 yes the real clou at the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.890
 History of 39 euros are a few 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 things there is no bonus material here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 So all the bonus dvds are missing nine 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.380
 Part of the total number are here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 only the movie is so six blu rays and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 the only bonus material is a few 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.680
 audio commentary is not that bad 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.420
 because as I said already the dvds have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.650
 and the bonus material on it is me 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 I'm not even sure if I am 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.460
 want to keep 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.680
 and secondly, here is a cinema voucher 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.290
 with it someone looks for the hobbit 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.210
 yes with all the extras you would be there 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.810
 So 3d extra length and so on that is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.520
 So a warner brothers good seems so 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.750
 rather just reserve a place or 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.990
 or go to the cinema 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 and then the good woman says 30 euros 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.150
 please a lot today and about that costs 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.520
 you just leave that coupon there 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.960
 and be peaceful the hobbit the whole 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.750
 was worth it for me without this 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.430
 I would not have bought a coupon either 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.330
 For the reason memory hobbit I am 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.539
 I'm relatively sure I'm in 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.459
 at least once will see 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 and therefore worth the story about 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.970
 the prices this in the cinema today so 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.140
 it does not happen that way 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.550
 so luxurious the previous boxes 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.290
 it's a bit shiny here 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.930
 you see here 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.430
 Saxony is firmly on print and in the 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.069
 in the end it is a slipcase 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.310
 few maries were so wants schubert 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:42.180
 reasonably well 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 yes, here is this coupon cool 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.090
 history the hard reality that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.290
 apply in all cinemas throughout 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.769
 Germany so no one can 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.030
 Talk about it except the imagination is 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.400
 sold out and you can not 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.190
 cheat or so you know 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.970
 Reserve normally but that must be every 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.609
 cinema should accept the movie in whole 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.910
 simple maries the companions the children 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:09.120
 just a quick look in just the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.570
 both parts of the discs of the design 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:20.100
 I think the same as at 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:21.630
 the luxury version if I have it so 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.109
 nothing spectacular and yes 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.109
 bonus material four audio comments 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.780
 That's it, then I usually think so because 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:37.770
 the next pictures that is natural 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.750
 nice here but nothing happens yes me 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.450
 wanted to have the movies on blu-ray the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.160
 DVD's are very good but I wanted 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.080
 the maximum possible home cinema experience 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.300
 in the film around me again on the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.580
 to tune hobbit and the movie ticket 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.480
 was also interesting there I have 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.590
 accessed for narrow money yes so 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.420
 it probably is not narrow 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.560
 but as I said with the movie ticket 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.000
 any case worthwhile if you do not 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.130
 chic box needs if you no 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.230
 bonus material needs only the 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.420
 high fields an extended version i 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.959
 do not even recommend this version 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.610
 So the cinematic version is the expedition 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.390
 This is not really worth it only 23 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.880
 minutes more 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.000
 That's half an hour in the morning 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.560
 more or less worth the average 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.280
 In any case, I am very good 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.280
 out again
