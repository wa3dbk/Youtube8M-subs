00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.510
 the fugue is a construction technical 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.310
 cultural heritage and has a long history 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.779
 which goes back to ancient times 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.910
 at times the Romans as well as today 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.840
 the fugue takes on both design 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.220
 as well as functional tasks of 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 hygienic closure of the tile 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.790
 covering the removal of tension 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.980
 compensation for material and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.110
 handicraft tolerances all the way to 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.720
 safety aspects and design 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.790
 Features modern jointing materials 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.710
 Today, they are no longer just sand 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.470
 and cement but from a variety 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.710
 different raw materials 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.450
 These are absolute high tech products in the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.100
 Contrary to earlier are the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.079
 challenges to the meadow market 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.430
 increased significantly and therefore, of course 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:11.110
 Also the requirements for the train mortar 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.329
 large formats new shades with strong 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.220
 pigmentation different coverings 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.020
 types and surfaces require the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.909
 Careful selection of the right joint 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.280
 and good knowledge of the 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.469
 Processing and after-treatment if you 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.479
 For example, in the bathroom make with 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.210
 a big one flows where she has a small one 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.009
 spark if the daily will be then only 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.389
 for the whole bathroom broken there you have to 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.999
 Of course, it depends on the joints 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.619
 themselves have become very small for 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.119
 the joints mistake itself difficult 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.240
 in danger we were in the practical 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.130
 Error of many small on 2 mm 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.109
 must then be process with 25 kilometer 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.459
 on another plate that's the fugue 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.900
 reasonable power and have to from 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.970
 has twice 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.770
 sex makes it easy for you with the help of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.960
 join navigators come with three 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.150
 clicks to the goal simply the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 application area the material type and 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.030
 the width of the desired fugue 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.619
 choose and they already have the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.930
 Product recommendations for the right one 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.940
 Application case a child before you with 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.910
 the order starts a pattern area 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.679
 create and the color test so you can 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.390
 the customer in advance the effect of the fugue in 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.130
 show connection with the tile on the spot 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.959
 and ensure that the final result 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.010
 indeed the customer's request 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:23.540
 corresponds to most construction sites 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.640
 you can still find the dirt his 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.290
 facilities granted a careful 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.360
 Cleaning the area but creates 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.630
 optimal conditions for a good one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.630
 end result 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.560
 all cement joint mortar from adex 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.950
 You can easily do it by hand 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.950
 mission 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.970
 the excellent 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.920
 Processing properties make that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.920
 a joint especially comfortable 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.250
 depending on the mortar used are the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.909
 products of different lengths too 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.909
 to process 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.340
 just lighter when using 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.890
 you should pay attention to clean 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.930
 blacken now they have one before 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.000
 heavily pigmented mortar used 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.989
 can cause residue on tools too 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.989
 cause discoloration 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.159
 for optimal results is the right one 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.010
 time of washing crucial 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.319
 make the finger drug test nortel 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.909
 flooring type and construction site condition 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.189
 can influence this 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.530
 Beck's grout are designed that way 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.450
 that leaves fresh pigment residues 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.859
 fast and easy even with little 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.759
 Water from the floor surface 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.709
 have it removed 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:20.900
 here, the stronger the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.479
 pigmentation of the joint material 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.500
 consuming the wash up 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.660
 decisive here is the exposure time 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.150
 but not the amount of water on the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.070
 covering surface sponges resp 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.639
 Therefore, swimming boards should be moist 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.370
 his 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.960
 but not dripping wet an alternative order 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.910
 the covering with little water but 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.520
 to moisten evenly is the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.470
 Use of a pressure spray bottle whole 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.860
 incidentally, this also relieves her 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.659
 move 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.430
 with the help of these devices will be one 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.680
 even water film on amount 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.090
 Surplus water is also in the pipeline 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.960
 avoided and the danger of 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.430
 discoloration additionally reduced 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.199
 she with a microfiber cloth that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.199
 optimize the joint image even further 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.230
 addex joints are special 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.880
 resistant 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.560
 but also the most resistant 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.400
 Centrifuge can be acidic 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.320
 be attacked cleaner 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.390
 We recommend to care who 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.960
 neutral cleanse for a beautiful and 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.220
 long-lasting joint image becks easy 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.220
 perfect joints
