Florida<00:04:52.630> some<00:04:53.630> guy<00:04:53.810> some<00:04:54.260> guy<00:04:54.380> they<00:04:54.830> do<00:04:54.889> get<00:04:55.159> a

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
Florida some guy some guy they do get a

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.899 
Florida some guy some guy they do get a
hold<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.780> get<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.900> old<00:04:57.020> finger<00:04:57.349> ready<00:04:57.909> I

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
think it'd be harder to find out an

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.589 
think it'd be harder to find out an
alligator<00:05:01.099> though<00:05:01.580> that's<00:05:02.090> all<00:05:02.300> the<00:05:02.449> same

alligator though that's all the same

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.360 
alligator though that's all the same
percentage<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.169> it<00:05:03.349> really<00:05:03.650> yeah<00:05:03.860> okay

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
percentage is it really yeah okay

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.510
