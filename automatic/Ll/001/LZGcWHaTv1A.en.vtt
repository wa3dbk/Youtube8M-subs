00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.130
 project with try skoda rapid 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.130
 changing my pros 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.430
 seemingly tpr we will about 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.340
 Astana our section you are trying 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.130
 shine and maneuverability car 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.320
 a miracle of hearing a skater rapid 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.180
 otzhe wagon of thirst shock was 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.850
 characteristic view of the sign and the car 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.250
 skoda rush to the scenes at the base of the prophet 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.500
 on kinematics ne-2 ski bus elani 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.320
 stabilizer oven stack stack fang 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.790
 they are effectively 1 to 9 navantazhennya even 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.760
 less in this body roll 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.790
 I cpu what are you, matty new rapid on 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:09.280
 far from ideal Ukrainian roads for 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:13.270
 since we do not know and handling let's say 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:19.270
 so at a high level very clearly 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.979
 listening to the steering wheel well enough so 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.280
 responsively any reactions whatever 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.750
 lungs 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.539
 there are hand movements and and cars in 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.300
 principle can calm 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.590
 change the trajectory is the golden mean 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.920
 car that allows one 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 parties 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.930
 keep it manageable ie 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.680
 we passed this ladder very lightly 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.290
 since it is small but at the same time 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.500
 it's big enough to 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.140
 track does not jump on each bump 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.900
 do not be such an ironing spend too 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.020
 goes well good visibility in front and 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.000
 back if you do not take into account the rear moment 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.829
 rear window mirror it is pretty 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.360
 small but it's for an amateur let's say so 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.670
 here are the mirrors everything is visible all is well 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.590
 feel a lot of space when 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.370
 this car itself is pretty 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.390
 compact and for urban format it 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.340
 let's go well let's say so visibility with 1 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.620
 times you do not get used to the second time already 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.940
 more familiar to the car so something 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.050
 we are normally good you will be justified 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.100
 tune 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.660
 forward mirrors everything is fine 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.500
 maneuverability wonderful amplifier 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.560
 the steering wheel works perfectly for on the dynamics 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.270
 Now we check the main thing is not 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.070
 exaggerates speed otherwise 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.370
 come visit and so wonderful 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.300
 well turns the mirror everything is visible 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 rebuilt cabin year suspension 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.960
 of course if it were softer wrong 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.670
 well would go into a turn and a little bit 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.990
 harsh though for our seafood all 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.920
 still go if it is burned and 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.830
 steering basically enough 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.380
 informative and but it seemed 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.900
 the amount from lock to lock still like 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.510
 would have been no less it showed 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.150
 taxiing on a snake well, this is also in principle 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.010
 you can get used to it 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.110
 get used to it 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.230
 already complete the advantages of this machine 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.230
 already 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.030
 create this so let think let 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.069
 think I don't even know 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.240
 thanks to the mirrors can, in principle, 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.160
 do what you need but don't care 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.300
 of course on the rear window absolutely 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.040
 there is no need to navigate the mirror 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:53.260
 enough mirror not located 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.260
 near and mirrors enough visibility 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.380
 pretty good for the city of mirror 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.870
 small but they can see everything now 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.870
 I'll try to call the garages 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.319
 chic to 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:36.010
 You can see everything perfectly on the mirrors 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.370
 The ruddy booster works 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:43.840
 ok, now I understand why 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.490
 rear-view mirrors are like 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.640
 feel the dimensions of the machine in principle 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:55.360
 although they are not familiar, but I feel that I 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.070
 I understand where the bottom where the edge where the periods I'm in 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:06.630
 Shocked, I would not have penetrated so alone 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:09.130
 Excellent myagenko clearly very comfortable 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.720
 arranges the position all beautiful in 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.320
 car google first impression is very 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.320
 like
