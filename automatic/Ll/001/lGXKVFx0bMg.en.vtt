00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
my shapes and so those get cut out and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.979 
my shapes and so those get cut out and
then<00:03:35.470> what<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.739> did<00:03:36.100> is<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.760> just<00:03:37.209> stood<00:03:37.570> I

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
then what I did is I just stood I

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.500 
then what I did is I just stood I
actually<00:03:38.500> applied<00:03:39.070> feasible<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.880> my<00:03:40.030> fabrics

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
actually applied feasible to my fabrics

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.020 
actually applied feasible to my fabrics
before<00:03:40.930> I<00:03:40.959> applied<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:42.010> um<00:03:42.310> this

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
before I applied it to this um this

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.020 
before I applied it to this um this
fabric<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.860> so<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.160> would<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.400> cut<00:03:45.790> those

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
fabric and so you would just cut those

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.150 
fabric and so you would just cut those
out<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.510> place<00:03:47.050> them<00:03:47.350> anywhere<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:48.040> you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
out and place them anywhere that you

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.330 
out and place them anywhere that you
want<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.730> then<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.600> get<00:03:49.810> these<00:03:50.080> outlines<00:03:50.800> what

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
want and then to get these outlines what

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.620 
want and then to get these outlines what
I<00:03:51.370> did<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:52.800> with<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.980> leftover<00:03:54.489> fabric<00:03:54.790> as<00:03:55.300> it

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
I did is with the leftover fabric as it

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.229 
I did is with the leftover fabric as it
comes<00:03:55.900> out<00:03:56.170> of<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.440> dies<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:57.400> can<00:03:57.580> see<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
comes out of the dies you can see the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.009 
comes out of the dies you can see the
the<00:03:58.780> shapes<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.470> are<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.040> center<00:04:01.019> and/or

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
the shapes that are in the center and/or

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.350 
the shapes that are in the center and/or
the<00:04:02.200> outlines<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.100> shapes<00:04:03.400> so<00:04:03.580> all<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:03.910> did

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
the outlines of the shapes so all I did

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.740 
the outlines of the shapes so all I did
really<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:05.050> just<00:04:05.890> go<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:06.400> cut<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.970> narrow<00:04:07.360> line

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
really is just go and cut a narrow line

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.430 
really is just go and cut a narrow line
by<00:04:08.590> hand<00:04:08.700> around<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.880> outside<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:11.380> then

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
by hand around the outside and then

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.759 
by hand around the outside and then
applicate<00:04:12.160> those<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.610> as<00:04:12.820> well<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.620> did<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
applicate those on as well I did the

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.090 
applicate those on as well I did the
same<00:04:15.040> thing<00:04:15.120> with<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.450> squiggly<00:04:16.959> shapes<00:04:17.470> in<00:04:17.890> a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
same thing with the squiggly shapes in a

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.750 
same thing with the squiggly shapes in a
different<00:04:18.519> color<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:19.060> then<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.250> fuse<00:04:21.250> those<00:04:21.460> to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
different color and then I fuse those to

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.190 
different color and then I fuse those to
the<00:04:21.910> fabric<00:04:22.390> created

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the fabric created

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.160 
the fabric created
quilt<00:04:23.380> sandwich<00:04:24.150> did<00:04:25.150> some<00:04:25.390> loose<00:04:25.600> stippling

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
quilt sandwich did some loose stippling

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.060 
quilt sandwich did some loose stippling
and<00:04:26.790> then<00:04:27.790> for<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.180> flange<00:04:28.510> all<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.680> a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
and then for the flange all this is is a

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.660 
and then for the flange all this is is a
piece<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.850> two<00:04:31.120> inch<00:04:31.950> it's<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:33.100> two<00:04:33.310> inch<00:04:33.490> strip

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
piece of two inch it's a two inch strip

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.300 
piece of two inch it's a two inch strip
that<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.540> folded<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.200> half<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.710> then<00:04:36.280> just

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
that I folded in half and then just

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.670 
that I folded in half and then just
sandwiched<00:04:36.970> in<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.420> seam<00:04:37.720> as<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.170> was<00:04:38.320> putting

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
sandwiched in the seam as I was putting

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.130 
sandwiched in the seam as I was putting
