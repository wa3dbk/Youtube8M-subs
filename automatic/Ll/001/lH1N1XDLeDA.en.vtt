00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
where we are now we're based on the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.410 
where we are now we're based on the
middle<00:00:49.740> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> lake<00:00:50.100> you're<00:00:51.000> looking<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.330> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
middle of the lake you're looking at the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.480

goes back into the lake basically
there's<00:04:41.300> our<00:04:41.570> new<00:04:41.810> rules<00:04:42.080> coming<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.560> very

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
there's our new rules coming in very

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.470 
there's our new rules coming in very
very<00:04:43.550> soon<00:04:43.760> where<00:04:44.000> you're<00:04:44.120> going<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.300> have<00:04:44.390> to

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
very soon where you're going to have to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.860 
very soon where you're going to have to
contain<00:04:45.290> that<00:04:45.530> water<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.690> process<00:04:47.690> that

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
contain that water and process that

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.300 
contain that water and process that
water<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.440> extra<00:04:48.620> water<00:04:48.800> that<00:04:48.980> goes<00:04:49.070> back

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
water so the extra water that goes back

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.950 
water so the extra water that goes back
into<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> lake<00:04:49.820> will<00:04:50.060> be<00:04:50.180> cleaner<00:04:50.690> than<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
into the lake will be cleaner than the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.750 
into the lake will be cleaner than the
water<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.260> comes<00:04:51.380> out<00:04:51.590> of<00:04:51.680> the<00:04:51.800> lake<00:04:51.980> jeez

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
water that comes out of the lake jeez

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.430 
water that comes out of the lake jeez
