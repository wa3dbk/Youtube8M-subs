 games games 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:16.510
 gold and credits a gaming specialist 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.000
 with fighting prizes yes hello dear 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.849
 community get a very small 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.789
 tutorial here on saturday with your thc 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.250
 and no one around today like that 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.779
 you can get your honor faster or 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.340
 or one of the ways around 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.290
 to get a quicker honor 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.660
 I take that on the island of the thunder here 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.670
 after we is four solo made 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.989
 you can decide between 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.760
 Of course pb and pvp quests have the 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.570
 pvp quests accepted 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 and each of these quests is there in total 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.010
 75 honor 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.950
 altogether it is around the 750 remember 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.570
 are all together 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.980
 of course a good deal and that 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.780
 The very first thing I do is the first 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.879
 Course I always do son 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.289
 I gather as the very first one is here in 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.789
 ball 1 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.910
 because the problem on the whole 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.240
 history you are marked for the pvp 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.030
 that is mark west which goes against npcs 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.310
 and not against players because of the cvp 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.819
 marked and other players can you 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.350
 at any time, so attack and even 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.270
 turn it off and if he has this ball 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.690
 take along since the first time very much 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.670
 conspicuously second, once you 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.560
 the bullet has just gone away i died 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.390
 just do not know if they are still on 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.869
 his places lies or whether the ares 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.819
 Bonn 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.259
 because you can be on the top right 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.640
 she then did not show up and then could 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.459
 also right-click and then it goes up 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.690
 also away so depending on whether you always 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.819
 do not take care again no risk 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.500
 on my server where i go 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.060
 Games are always certain people 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.099
 not only two online so far 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.989
 rarely attacked but it can always 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.599
 happen again that one times 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.000
 is attacked by opposing 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.700
 then play the mood and mood 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.289
 have you during the west yet 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.580
 yes to make the garaus I say so 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.200
 and what is that you know about her 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.989
 can the qs either do that to you ? 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.450
 But you can also complete basket with 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.940
 make yours there is nothing 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 both give a gift that gives as well 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.510
 no points river else but it 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.660
 just gets faster you can 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 you the quests are most of the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.710
 and you too are sharing this 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.270
 means no one has to be here now like fear 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.210
 have that one or the other you 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.610
 something in the way is bleeding or something 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.230
 that's all well shared is all about 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.720
 wonderful is also very fast 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.970
 So all in all needed for the quest 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.680
 maybe eight to twelve minutes each 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.930
 on the way bmw on the way 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.590
 Of course I have no pvg 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.060
 more big on me I'm completely just pvp 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.490
 group that means in the clear text one years 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.440
 is has just a few others worth it 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.330
 of course the same with 1 endcontent 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.010
 you walk the course even faster 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.620
 always about 30 degrees, of course 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.390
 damage and a high lay the tvm with 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.700
 a content and so he makes already 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.930
 just a lot more than he still can 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
 achieve faster talk 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.100
 when I have with our pvp we have 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.210
 of course the time taxed here 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.370
 not that he wonders why 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.260
 she's going to be as fast 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.290
 Of course not every single thing 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.450
 show of course anyway in flower 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.710
 while having little or a 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.150
 yes make a run and know the yes 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.670
 I do not have to kill music 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.920
 kill and then be tight 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.930
 can do so and wanted the circle 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.890
 I do not have any problems yet 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.500
 to forget something 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.410
 and here is something else but should 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.540
 so go out that you directly with a 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.980
 step directly has everything and 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.800
 of course, once against one another 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.630
 npcs do not have to kill you anymore 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.640
 goes away and on the other hand too 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.170
 go against the biggest 1000 players 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.880
 can if you think now okay me 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.650
 there must be the luton or 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.350
 which liberate the people 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.660
 then, of course, so that may be one 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.550
 Being a player can be forgotten 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.050
 also figurine figurines themselves 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.270
 can make magician about 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.130
 It is also invisible to you recently 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.930
 invisible and you have too 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.280
 invisible is always possible 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.739
 that any of the back of the 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.720
 The opponents are not themselves 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.970
 especially strong the standard troops 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.670
 can you push them around a bit 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 can be quite annoying 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.270
 especially on earth if you do not like that 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.739
 should cause a lot of damage and 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.359
 so that I have tried this problem 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.490
 to get one out 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.810
 also great and very good is just the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.470
 quest if you have to wait so long 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.539
 I'm not scared, either 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.070
 here is sometimes invisible how briefly 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.180
 since I admit also sometimes nice to 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.919
 must also fit very well 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.169
 a big light pole because the big one 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.340
 German not to the quest and there is 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.220
 of course , the pad again great 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.500
 The company also likes to blame 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.270
 that either another succeeded 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.430
 possibly before that is also right 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.190
 relatively very good damage with the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.780
 talk denic is so here is on 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.150
 each case area damage do so 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.009
 really fleet is still running 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.430
 important just at the boss there is here 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:00.400
 so to speak 1 bosses around this great 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.810
 elementary because you have to take care thinks 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.180
 I have to peter too 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.030
 kill and take care of it as usual 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.740
 that drives the drive really well 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.270
 be careful there is always very close 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.009
 so if you do not have a good one 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.940
 Equipment would have to be very good 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.430
 watch out 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.650
 that is also so they are not too 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.690
 Walk far into the middle is likely in 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.509
 this area is and left there 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.250
 and then you have to take care so much 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.800
 in the middle goes further from her 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.960
 moving away the higher the chance 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.849
 So to reset the reset very 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.570
 like to go back there you have to be very strong 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.449
 watch out 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.979
 unfortunately it is such a problem there but 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.199
 Here I could porten a nice rom 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.229
 already spread and take all 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.909
 things stop him and take her 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.949
 Killing a monster is very important 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.419
 So if this person you post this person 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.250
 It was always the same to kill there 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.050
 a lot of damage is all it takes 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.479
 important to explain everything really beforehand 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.310
 even if you are not there with these npcs 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.320
 because you all have to kill it will have to 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.060
 Nevertheless, because the chance the desk 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.530
 relationship to see that he alcohol from 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.210
 get that and then you just 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.000
 put house because these foot soldiers do 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.940
 is you etc in the scale of the big boss 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.590
 Also, as I said, not without james 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.320
 Brown's book was right there too 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.599
 this tent is very important 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.400
 should not be in the fight if him 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.139
 fighting time comes the following message 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.759
 There is nothing wrong with the hat 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.220
 that should be prevented that you 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:24.720
 Everything will then join you together 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.919
 bz puts and then just 80 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.570
 but first of course, as I said 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.870
 here the market damage we this figure 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.750
 Immediately see that said my best 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.210
 then 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.950
 give hierum cold and also best 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.380
 I can do that as well 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.000
 clones of more represent the room battery 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.030
 as a sorcerer you should necessarily 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.460
 the teachers or the parking in the you 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.200
 then the agro takes indeed the enormous good 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.030
 because there are these circles below 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.280
 you see the naro ideas he sees there 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.870
 and that can also be correct 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.000
 Damage causes the man of the past 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.370
 already starting from a house ran for over 100 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.050
 get years then you have to be very good 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.120
 be careful your equipment is that very 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.800
 dangerous and if i use this etc 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.350
 would not have turned off around 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.450
 then maybe I would have gone for it 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.770
 After all quester done wonderful 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.380
 Of course, that was history 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.790
 know how about eight minutes just about 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.290
 as I said so now not from the video 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.470
 but from the gameplay we can do that 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.800
 All give well and carefully 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.940
 do not forget to hand over the quads 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.460
 because their content we at the end too 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.370
 one more time west and so on 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.490
 a donation made a danish one 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.290
 you still get a box from the hello 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.150
 Of course there is something that can be done
