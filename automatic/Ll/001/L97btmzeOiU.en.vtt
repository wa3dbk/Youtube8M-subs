cool stuff so what about your regular

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.569 
cool stuff so what about your regular
apps<00:01:48.630> that's<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.409> big<00:01:49.590> question<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.310> hit<00:01:50.430> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
apps that's a big question you hit this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.050 
apps that's a big question you hit this
tablet<00:01:51.090> mode<00:01:51.270> extension<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.140> extend<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
tablet mode extension it will extend the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.429 
tablet mode extension it will extend the
standard<00:01:54.060> Android<00:01:54.479> apps<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.990> doesn't

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
standard Android apps it doesn't

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.990 
standard Android apps it doesn't
necessarily<00:01:55.500> mean<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.759> work

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
necessarily mean all of them will work

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
necessarily mean all of them will work
because<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.200> not<00:01:58.350> optimized<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
because it's not optimized for it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
because it's not optimized for it
hopefully<00:02:00.299> developers<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.320> pick<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
hopefully developers can pick up on the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.959 
hopefully developers can pick up on the
kyocera<00:02:02.700> echo<00:02:03.530> SDK<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.560> create<00:02:05.159> stuff<00:02:05.430> so

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
kyocera echo SDK and create stuff so

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.229 
kyocera echo SDK and create stuff so
