00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.460
 go hi everyone his offers to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.990
 pledge I hope you are well 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.369
 people for me it's going great I 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.449
 am really very great shape what 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.010
 you have a background gameplay it's a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.210
 little part of stopping these three 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.710
 sleeves because after I did the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 shit I just wanted to show a little 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.590
 gameplay it's nice three small 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.490
 nice enough sleeves to talk to you 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.289
 of a new series that I will put 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 in place and that's exactly why I 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.080
 put it up is because you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.489
 are at the heart of this series you are 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.260
 the first to actually participate without 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.610
 you this series can not exist and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110
 imagine would not exist without you too 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.030
 we agree 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.010
 so in fact it's going the title it's the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.910
 rules have changed on call of duty 7 the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.170
 rules have changed on call of duty 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
 episode in episode 2 true people 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.260
 many there will be about maybe on 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.969
 mw3 but I do not think so because there is no 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 bad of cheat right now at the end of two 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.199
 hackers etc but I think about black 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.449
 ops 2 on ghost it can be super nice 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.039
 to do so I'm explaining we're all going 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.629
 go to r &amp; d 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.120
 so here is a little bit always in r &amp; d 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.770
 the basic game mode we will leave I 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.539
 go for example pull everyone 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.280
 take the sniper we will create a class 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.720
 nay fear that will have been imposed by you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.070
 in the comments ie that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.540
 done there you're going to put us in the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.280
 comments you go because it takes 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.570
 that this series works it is necessary that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.360

 handle we take all is a tone created the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.439
 same class the one that makes the best 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.299
 score he has the right to give their cage 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.009
 a pledge to the one who did the least good 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.020
 score is actually every round 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.399
 we will change there will be different pledges 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.579
 according to whoever will do the most 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.200
 kid who will always give away 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.250
 a pledge to the one who has made the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.530
 less so all the sleeves will have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.000
 release clears of course it's you 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.740
 who should give them to me is so give 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.920
 of this video please tell me 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.240
 all the pledges that make pleasure kind 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610
 stuff that we would make in 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 live on skype and was created months of 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.420
 crap classes that host of stuff 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.320
 from pgm classes to the worst finally a 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.569
 little of everything we try to 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.280
 diversify and then we will leave and each 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140
 handle in fact we will change weapons on 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.460
 will change this type 2 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.230
 so had missed monster there will be sleeves 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.280
 pgm will have sleeves tied fear of the coup 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.270
 there will be for everyone the whole 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.560
 world will be happy everyone do 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.100
 a little bit and we're going to do that all 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.290
 together 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.670
 the one who will really make a sea score 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.610
 whoever will get to do 0 kills in 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.200
 the part he will have a something in 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.400
 more so here I was actually it's 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.810
 just an idea for now that I 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.700
 gives you but I think it can 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.890
 to be super nice ie in fact 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.480
 it's a class game in fact where we 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 change classes we change the style of 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.660
 game the one who does the most of that he can 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.940
 give wages to the one who does the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.739
 unless they release them it's you who 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.150
 gave them the classes it's you who 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.380
 create them in them finally we put the creations 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.790
 intends to rise by saying them in the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.080
 comments finally accessing that it was 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.430
 so I think it can be pretty 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.110
 nice tell me what you think 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.610
 if you have a fucking idea because 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.690
 I know subscribers are behind 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.980
 you have in your head time in 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.640
 time we buy channel years that I am 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.470
 there I know you surely have 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.600
 ideas a little smarter 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.610
 to try to develop a little the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.290
 concept of finding things more fun 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.239
 realized for example if you find that 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.650
 the idea of ​​classes is not bad but that 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.660
 you have to put something else instead 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.400
 pledges or then find rules 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.630
 try to develop this concept role of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.130
 duty like this at first we wanted too much 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.510
 light try to remix it a little bit 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.980
 here we are tell me if you have any 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.329
 ideas do not hesitate to put a gem for 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.010
 tell me if this series makes you happy 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.120

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.620
 comments I would be if I'm going 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.940
 start throwing it but if that you 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.079
