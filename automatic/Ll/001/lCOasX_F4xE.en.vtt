00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
to have any other these selected so

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.480 
to have any other these selected so
cables<00:02:25.390> only<00:02:25.630> have<00:02:25.959> one<00:02:26.410> cable<00:02:26.680> selected<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
cables only have one cable selected and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.640 
cables only have one cable selected and
you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.330> go<00:02:28.420> on<00:02:28.510> ahead<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.720> hit<00:02:29.140> close<00:02:29.410> on

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
you can go on ahead and hit close on

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.010 
you can go on ahead and hit close on
that<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.490> go<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.940> all<00:02:31.090> programs<00:02:31.270> again<00:02:31.750> under

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
virtual audio cable its audio repeater

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.860 
virtual audio cable its audio repeater
or<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:35.200> mic<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:36.430> believe<00:02:36.640> since<00:02:36.940> I'm<00:02:37.090> 64-bit

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
or and mic is I believe since I'm 64-bit

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.220 
or and mic is I believe since I'm 64-bit
its<00:02:38.560> audio<00:02:38.950> repeater<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
its audio repeater and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.130 
its audio repeater and
so<00:02:41.220> go<00:02:41.580> ahead<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.819> open<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.420> then

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
so go ahead and open that and then

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
so go ahead and open that and then
before<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:44.340> anything<00:02:44.610> go<00:02:45.090> ahead<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.390> go

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
before you do anything go ahead and go

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
before you do anything go ahead and go
back<00:02:45.480> into<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.410> open<00:02:46.830> another<00:02:47.190> one

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
back into there and open another one

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.520 
back into there and open another one
okay<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.599> now<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.900> two<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> them<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
okay so now you have two of them on the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.949 
okay so now you have two of them on the
screen<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.610> first<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:51.209> will<00:02:51.690> be<00:02:51.810> your

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
screen the first one will be your

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.170 
screen the first one will be your
microphone<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.580> case<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> blue

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
microphone so in a case the blue

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.830 
microphone so in a case the blue
snowball

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
snowball

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.839 
snowball
so<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.440> waving<00:02:55.650> I'm<00:02:55.920> going<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.129> hit<00:02:56.519> blue

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
so in waving I'm going to hit blue

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.790 
so in waving I'm going to hit blue
snowball<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.510> wave<00:02:57.930> out<00:02:58.110> I'm<00:02:58.349> going<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.590> hit

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
snowball and wave out I'm going to hit

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.140 
snowball and wave out I'm going to hit
line<00:02:59.400> one<00:03:00.530> okay<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> wave<00:03:02.489> out<00:03:02.670> basically

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
line one okay so the wave out basically

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.790 
line one okay so the wave out basically
means<00:03:03.390> what<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.050> show<00:03:04.170> up<00:03:04.319> as<00:03:04.500> when

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
means what it's going to show up as when

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.009 
means what it's going to show up as when
it<00:03:04.890> asks<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.430> default<00:03:05.880> audio<00:03:06.030> device<00:03:06.239> when

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
it asks for a default audio device when

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.270 
it asks for a default audio device when
you're<00:03:07.110> live<00:03:07.290> streaming<00:03:07.319> or<00:03:07.860> going<00:03:08.130> through

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
you're live streaming or going through

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.270 
you're live streaming or going through
our<00:03:08.370> density<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.319> second<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:10.980> you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
our density so on the second one you

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.949 
our density so on the second one you
want<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.580> hit<00:03:11.700> your<00:03:11.940> speakers<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.690> my<00:03:12.900> case
