two Italian helmets here the arrow is on

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.400 
two Italian helmets here the arrow is on
the<00:00:15.129> left<00:00:15.369> and<00:00:15.699> the<00:00:16.059> Swami<00:00:16.539> is<00:00:16.810> on<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.230> right

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
the left and the Swami is on the right

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.859 
the left and the Swami is on the right
pad<00:00:18.250> the<00:00:18.369> arrow<00:00:18.520> for<00:00:18.820> quite<00:00:18.970> a<00:00:19.000> long<00:00:19.210> time<00:00:19.270> and

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
pad the arrow for quite a long time and

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.980 
pad the arrow for quite a long time and
the<00:00:20.230> Swami<00:00:20.650> I<00:00:20.680> just<00:00:21.010> pulled<00:00:21.190> out<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.490> box

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the Swami I just pulled out of the box

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.390 
the Swami I just pulled out of the box
the<00:00:22.990> first<00:00:23.140> thing<00:00:23.290> that<00:00:23.530> struck<00:00:23.800> me<00:00:23.860> about<00:00:24.130> the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
the first thing that struck me about the

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.730 
the first thing that struck me about the
Swami<00:00:24.730> is<00:00:25.030> it<00:00:25.450> looks<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.930> lot<00:00:26.140> like<00:00:26.350> the<00:00:26.590> arrow

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
Swami is it looks a lot like the arrow

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.650 
Swami is it looks a lot like the arrow
in<00:00:27.460> some<00:00:27.640> ways<00:00:27.790> it<00:00:28.090> seems<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.390> be<00:00:28.510> quite

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
in some ways it seems to be quite

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.190 
in some ways it seems to be quite
similar<00:00:29.400> some<00:00:30.400> of<00:00:30.490> the<00:00:30.550> trim<00:00:30.789> features<00:00:31.270> appear

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
similar some of the trim features appear

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.950 
similar some of the trim features appear
to<00:00:32.320> be<00:00:32.910> possibly<00:00:33.910> from<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.120> same<00:00:34.239> factory

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
to be possibly from the same factory

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.250 
to be possibly from the same factory
this<00:00:36.149> helmet<00:00:37.149> strap<00:00:37.390> for<00:00:37.600> example<00:00:38.020> on<00:00:38.140> the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
this helmet strap for example on the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.010 
this helmet strap for example on the
arrow<00:00:38.500> is<00:00:39.040> exactly<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.150> same<00:00:40.329> one<00:00:40.600> that<00:00:40.810> comes

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
arrow is exactly the same one that comes

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.720 
arrow is exactly the same one that comes
on<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.230> Swami<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:44.140> shape<00:00:44.860> of<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.160> shell<00:00:45.430> and

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
on the Swami the shape of the shell and

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.300 
on the Swami the shape of the shell and
the<00:00:46.480> padding<00:00:46.899> seems<00:00:47.560> to<00:00:47.649> be<00:00:47.739> quite<00:00:47.980> similar

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
the padding seems to be quite similar

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.420 
the padding seems to be quite similar
they<00:00:49.180> both<00:00:49.630> fit<00:00:49.899> my<00:00:50.079> head<00:00:50.350> almost<00:00:50.860> identically

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
they both fit my head almost identically

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.200 
they both fit my head almost identically
I<00:00:51.670> have<00:00:52.570> kind<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.989> medium<00:00:53.440> oval<00:00:54.190> head<00:00:54.399> so<00:00:55.180> I

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
I have kind of a medium oval head so I

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.709 
I have kind of a medium oval head so I
show<00:00:55.809> he<00:00:55.960> fits<00:00:56.200> me<00:00:56.350> well<00:00:56.380> but<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.719> better

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
show he fits me well but a better

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.549 
show he fits me well but a better
riordan<00:00:59.649> doesn't<00:01:00.070> fit<00:01:00.190> me<00:01:00.309> so<00:01:00.340> well<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.989> if

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
riordan doesn't fit me so well so if

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.439 
riordan doesn't fit me so well so if
you're<00:01:02.800> like<00:01:02.980> me<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.520> have<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.790> longer<00:01:04.239> head

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
you're like me and have the longer head

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.789 
you're like me and have the longer head
then<00:01:04.659> these<00:01:04.839> are<00:01:05.019> both<00:01:05.199> good<00:01:05.469> options

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.709 

the<00:01:08.799> other<00:01:09.219> notable<00:01:09.820> part<00:01:10.329> about<00:01:10.509> these

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
the other notable part about these

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:22.450 
the other notable part about these
helmets<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:12.090> weight<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.350> let's<00:01:14.590> check

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:36.280 

okay<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.360> arrow<00:01:23.540> comes<00:01:23.870> in<00:01:24.080> at<00:01:25.180> 1123<00:01:26.180> grams

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.660 

and<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.010> salami<00:01:37.520> is<00:01:38.260> 1034<00:01:39.260> crannis<00:01:42.400> my<00:01:43.400> arrow

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and the salami is 1034 crannis my arrow

to<00:01:52.430> those<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.790> only<00:01:53.030> 24<00:01:53.450> graders<00:01:53.870> so<00:01:54.670> swimming

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
to those is only 24 graders so swimming

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.910 
to those is only 24 graders so swimming

I bought for 380 on eBay the build
quality<00:02:11.690> these<00:02:12.080> two<00:02:12.350> helmets<00:02:12.530> appears<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.070> be

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
quality these two helmets appears to be

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.190 
quality these two helmets appears to be
quite<00:02:13.370> similar<00:02:13.760> I'd<00:02:14.150> say<00:02:14.360> they're<00:02:14.540> both<00:02:14.870> sort

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
quite similar I'd say they're both sort

for high-end helmets the arrow has

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.880 
for high-end helmets the arrow has
lasted<00:02:21.980> long<00:02:22.580> enough<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.090> would<00:02:23.150> say<00:02:23.480> for<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:24.860> a
