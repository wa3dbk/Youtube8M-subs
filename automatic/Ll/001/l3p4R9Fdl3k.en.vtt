guys<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.220> have<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.610> speed<00:00:02.879> comparison<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.659> it's

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.499 
guys I have a speed comparison and it's
between<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.740> iphone<00:00:05.160> 4s<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.970> iphone<00:00:06.299> 4

iphone 4 features an apple a4 chip and
they<00:00:15.960> both<00:00:16.109> feature<00:00:16.379> 512<00:00:17.279> megabytes<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> ram

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
they both feature 512 megabytes of ram

so let's go ahead and jump into the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
so let's go ahead and jump into the
speed<00:00:19.410> comparison

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:47.969

speed comparison let me know what you
guys<00:01:51.680> thought<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.369> speeds<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.820> think

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.460 
guys thought of the speeds you think
it's<00:01:53.090> gonna<00:01:53.210> be<00:01:53.390> worth<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:53.869> pick<00:01:54.200> up<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
it's gonna be worth it to pick up the

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.710 
it's gonna be worth it to pick up the
iphone<00:01:54.590> 4s<00:01:55.369> over<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.000> four<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:56.630> do<00:01:56.690> you

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
iphone 4s over the four what do you

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.030 
iphone 4s over the four what do you
think<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.960> speed<00:01:57.200> difference<00:01:57.560> doesn't

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
think the speed difference doesn't

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.920 
think the speed difference doesn't
really<00:01:58.310> matter<00:01:58.520> anyways<00:01:59.240> guys<00:01:59.390> thanks<00:01:59.810> all
