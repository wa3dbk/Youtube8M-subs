00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.289 
right here they felt a little stiff when
first<00:01:54.060> putting<00:01:54.240> them<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.110> also<00:01:55.259> felt<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
first putting them on and I also felt a

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
first putting them on and I also felt a
little<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.659> stud<00:01:57.840> pressure<00:01:58.140> from<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
little bit of stud pressure from this

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
little bit of stud pressure from this
guy<00:01:59.159> out<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.360> bit<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.719> here

again that might just be my foot my do a
wider<00:02:03.119> foot<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:04.049> didn't<00:02:04.290> fit<00:02:04.649> quite

you're paying a little bit more but you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.710 
you're paying a little bit more but you

get a little bit better control on the
ball<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.190> didn't<00:02:41.430> feel<00:02:41.520> like<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.760> great<00:02:42.090> control

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
on the ball with these it wasn't

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.710 
on the ball with these it wasn't
terrible<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.820> wasn't<00:02:45.120> definitely<00:02:45.540> wasn't

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
terrible but it wasn't definitely wasn't

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.020 
terrible but it wasn't definitely wasn't
what<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.959> expected<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:47.400> from<00:02:47.520> pests<00:02:47.880> from

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
what I expected just from pests from

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.360 
what I expected just from pests from
past<00:02:48.780> models<00:02:49.170> I've<00:02:49.290> tried<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.160> shoe

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
past models I've tried out of the shoe

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.180 
past models I've tried out of the shoe
so<00:02:51.209> completely<00:02:51.750> sleek<00:02:52.140> design<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.010> very

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so completely sleek design so it's very

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.490 
so completely sleek design so it's very
very<00:02:53.340> slick<00:02:53.880> I'm<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:54.630> which<00:02:55.140> isn't<00:02:55.410> a

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
very slick I'm up here which isn't a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.720 
very slick I'm up here which isn't a
terrible<00:02:55.950> thing<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.310> when<00:02:56.430> you're<00:02:56.520> on<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
terrible thing but when you're on the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.600 
terrible thing but when you're on the
ball<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.270> kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> hindered<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:59.250> control

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
ball it kind of hindered your control

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.920 
ball it kind of hindered your control
the<00:02:59.760> ball<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> little<00:03:00.120> bit<00:03:00.360> because<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.690> wasn't

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the ball a little bit because it wasn't

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.150 
the ball a little bit because it wasn't
as<00:03:00.989> tacky<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.470> front<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.860> that's<00:03:01.980> another

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
as tacky up front so that's another

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.150 
as tacky up front so that's another
thing<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.489> kind<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.700> look<00:03:02.820> for<00:03:03.620> as<00:03:04.620> far<00:03:04.800> as<00:03:04.950> fit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
thing to kind of look for as far as fit

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.820 
thing to kind of look for as far as fit
true<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> size<00:03:05.720> size<00:03:06.720> 9<00:03:06.959> they<00:03:07.290> fit<00:03:07.500> very<00:03:07.560> well

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
true to size size 9 they fit very well

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.560 
true to size size 9 they fit very well
as<00:03:08.100> far<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.370> length<00:03:08.580> there<00:03:08.910> they're<00:03:09.180> perfect

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
as far as length there they're perfect

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.479 
as far as length there they're perfect
so<00:03:09.750> whatever<00:03:10.320> size<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.530> normally<00:03:10.770> go<00:03:11.130> with<00:03:11.160> I

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
so whatever size you normally go with I

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.910 
so whatever size you normally go with I
would<00:03:11.640> say<00:03:11.760> go<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.180> size<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.770> again<00:03:13.770> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
would say go with that size on again the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.130 
would say go with that size on again the
width<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.250> these<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.820> aren't<00:03:15.239> terribly

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
width on these there aren't terribly

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.140 
width on these there aren't terribly
terribly<00:03:16.500> narrow<00:03:16.950> but<00:03:17.220> they<00:03:17.700> were<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.910> little

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
terribly narrow but they were a little

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.600 
terribly narrow but they were a little
bit<00:03:18.330> snug<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.750> me<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.620> do<00:03:20.190> believe<00:03:20.340> that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
bit snug for me and I do believe that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.800 
bit snug for me and I do believe that
they<00:03:20.700> will<00:03:20.850> stretch<00:03:21.090> out<00:03:21.299> with<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> synthetic

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
they will stretch out with the synthetic

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
they will stretch out with the synthetic
leather<00:03:22.170> it's<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.950> little<00:03:23.489> stiffer<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:24.000> it's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
leather it's a little stiffer but it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.580 
leather it's a little stiffer but it's
it's<00:03:24.360> not<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.810> stiff<00:03:25.049> that<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.350> won't<00:03:25.470> really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it's not so stiff that it won't really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.280 
it's not so stiff that it won't really
break<00:03:25.890> for<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.459> eventually<00:03:27.330> these<00:03:28.110> will

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290

stretch<00:03:28.530> out<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> little<00:03:28.799> bit<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.100> think<00:03:29.160> if<00:03:29.459> you

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
stretch out a little bit I think if you

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.800

were<00:03:29.700> them<00:03:29.820> enough<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.120> only<00:03:30.269> got<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.480> damn<00:03:30.690> of
