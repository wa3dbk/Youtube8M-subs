00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
dollars and then if you look at the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
dollars and then if you look at the
bottom<00:01:37.079> line<00:01:37.290> ipad<00:01:37.890> which<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.590 
bottom line ipad which is actually the
ipad<00:01:38.970> 2<00:01:39.299> it's<00:01:40.020> 399<00:01:40.650> dollars<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.700> presumably

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
ipad 2 it's 399 dollars so presumably

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
ipad 2 it's 399 dollars so presumably
would<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.200> somewhere<00:01:43.500> between<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
would be somewhere between then but you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.920 
would be somewhere between then but you
know<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.060> whole<00:01:45.270> idea<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.630> having<00:01:45.780> these

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
know the whole idea of having these

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.120 
know the whole idea of having these
smaller<00:01:46.200> tablets<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.040> would

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
smaller tablets is that they would

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
smaller tablets is that they would
actually<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.579> cheaper<00:01:47.780> than<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> big<00:01:49.020> tablets

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
actually be cheaper than the big tablets

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.859 
actually be cheaper than the big tablets
and<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.369> $300<00:01:50.939> device<00:01:51.240> competing

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and if that's a $300 device competing

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
and if that's a $300 device competing
against<00:01:52.229> something<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.369> hundred

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
against something that's one hundred

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.639 
against something that's one hundred
fifty<00:01:53.670> dollars<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.360> mean<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.960> gonna<00:01:55.200> have

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
fifty dollars i mean they're gonna have

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.840

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to put it somewhere in the two hundred
