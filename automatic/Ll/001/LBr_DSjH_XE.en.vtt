00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.460
 ideal and welcome you would have he myself i am the tester 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.000
 and we test today managers trust Tigers on the stages 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:15.779
 yes, but what is now seventh and their on the stages that is me here act 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.000
 Be this little huts I would be the manager and climb up a tree 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.319
 and measures jump all the time from states to origin 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:29.509
 Do not let yourself be caught by Leder Morrison or LZ Hanrahan der 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.399
 the opponent 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.310
 "I'll do the option first 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.010
 Apple 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.650
 not worth it to me now 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.900
 there you can first find yourself in Facebook a bear in Lank Andersen migratory birds 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.590
 look at 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.080
 or it was and Bonn on Fener like everyone else then there is still morning 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 that in Malsch more games from the developers 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.470
 that's why here 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.620
 which animal shows your percent west 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.290
 Percent that followed as follows I've already played twice we can see 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.770
 125 and 200 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.890
 89 points I have done and then all of her from the whole week and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.480
 then all of them 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.900
 all the time 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 but it is also Beck 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660
 and show you the whole thing 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.600
 Gonzo 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.790
 by elders on the tree stump 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.050
 climbs again and when you jump over titles on the other tree stump he jumps 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.410
 on the other and thus through the whole time she comments her here 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.730
 Fed her diaper 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.400
 Now if I have slippery slippery again and again, that's why I have to go now 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.380
 jump over and skip over 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.530
 the mushrooms are so trampolines 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.120
 that here it is a bit like a slingshot trick 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.540
 a bit up here then the Big Daddy are talking about that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.070
 Bats that charge you then 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.030
 There is also the Geest in the Harz that destroys you 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.970
 and if he does 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.300
 once that of so if you are hit by something in 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.690
 Immediately dead and around you from poisonous tree house or from the bats side 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.960
 and then summed up here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.610
 does not use then is always below 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.050
 Up here is also about her livestock Boel already clarified since I am 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.719
 a hundred sixth times 8 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.439
 and climbed 8 meters high 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.919
 we can do it all too 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.059
 there is no time to pause, he climbs faster than usual 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:19.389
 Nothing 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.959
 So if you have these now, there are some gadgets to collect 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.409
 can and must 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.149
 yes that was just so 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:31.789
 but you can see that is a pretty fun game has so 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.079
 in the small recognition value what you want yes one does not start so 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.450
 then all the time and here 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.480
 until you do it differently you have to do it differently and really do it 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.310
 Doodle Jump competition for me as possible so I am addicted I am 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.169
 pretty chaste after the match report 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.219
 Players and coaches made and ears again and and 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.489
 over and over and ball down and the sound and and again and we 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.979
 yes, I jumped 52 meters upwards 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.580
 This little organ was already on the iPhone 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.249
 that is not due to the app 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:09.359
 I'll tell you personally I think the game Kaida and I hope that more 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.529
 any 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.359
 Erding 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.140
 what's called 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.290
 Anyone who brings new stuff with him as of Rome is now 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.730
 so again and Getchell 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.700
 since I wars now a shield now I can be hit twice and 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.509
 talk 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.969
 more so now I've used the sign shit that I wanted 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.599
 Of course not now but it already percent 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.959
 made 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.169
 Damian Schwartz so it's fun for me they should not 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.579
 and now comes my 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.849
 Points start time so a grape he is what I jumped so far 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.390
 are 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.589
 Vienna is 780 meters and barely 400 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.979
 17 meters there is also such a funny Chino Bartz 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.569
 or wrong if they just go that way I'll make them weird 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.709
 from but Dr the German course as well as with the parents for example 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.459
 the rocket backpack clicks a little higher higher than you could 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.009
 have a little bit 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:11.259
 Percent delay a helmet then of course it's all tweeting 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.369
 or Facebook 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:16.739
 then there is here then won again play without any in the menu 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.519
 but bring nothing over 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.900
 I want to lighten up that ounce again 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 show to see how Hochtief come 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.139
 Dr um 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.879
 Yes 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.110
 So I think the players had incredible recognition and 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.130
 addictive 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.759
 what is singing in a duet 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.120
 that definitely makes the competition and 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.120
 Picture the price is also right nervous I am dead 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:46.900
 in the air 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.259
 Subscribe to come yes 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.120
