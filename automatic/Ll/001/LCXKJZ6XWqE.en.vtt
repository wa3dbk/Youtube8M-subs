00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
going to show you in the Bible where it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.130 
going to show you in the Bible where it
teaches<00:02:21.980> what<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.580> believe<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.570> believe<00:02:23.690> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
teaches what I believe what I believe is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
teaches what I believe what I believe is
what<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.380> Bible<00:02:24.650> teaches<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:26.240> don't

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
what the Bible teaches and so I don't

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.120 
what the Bible teaches and so I don't
have<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.930> worry<00:02:27.170> about<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.710> know<00:02:27.800> finding

myself<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.730> contradiction<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> Bible

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
myself in contradiction to the Bible

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.650 
myself in contradiction to the Bible
because<00:02:30.800> I'm<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.370> basing<00:02:31.850> my<00:02:31.970> doctrines<00:02:32.480> on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
because I'm not basing my doctrines on

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.540 
because I'm not basing my doctrines on
any<00:02:32.870> man-made<00:02:33.140> teaching<00:02:33.860> or<00:02:34.010> anything<00:02:34.400> else

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
any man-made teaching or anything else

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.390 
any man-made teaching or anything else

and bewilderment how people can can

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.210 
and bewilderment how people can can
argue<00:02:44.150> simply<00:02:44.810> against<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.620> quoting<00:02:46.100> of

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
argue simply against the quoting of

argue simply against the quoting of
verses<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.090> mean<00:02:47.750> how<00:02:48.350> can<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:49.250> accusation<00:02:49.880> be

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
verses I mean how can the accusation be

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.910 
verses I mean how can the accusation be
made<00:02:50.210> that<00:02:50.450> you've<00:02:50.840> twisted<00:02:51.140> versus<00:02:51.770> you

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
made that you've twisted versus you

verses and those verses very clearly

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.170 
verses and those verses very clearly
show<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.810> can<00:03:00.170> fall<00:03:00.770> from<00:03:01.580> grace<00:03:01.670> that
