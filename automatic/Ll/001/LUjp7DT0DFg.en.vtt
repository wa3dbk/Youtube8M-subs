00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.319 

my<00:00:37.469> work<00:00:37.710> integrates<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> physical<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
my work integrates the physical and the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
my work integrates the physical and the
digital<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:40.050> children<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
digital with children so this would be a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
digital with children so this would be a
representation<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> sticker<00:00:43.170> could

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
representation of what a sticker could

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
representation of what a sticker could
look<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> children's<00:00:44.760> bedroom<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
look like in a children's bedroom the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
look like in a children's bedroom the
app<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.200> brings<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.309> life<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
app kind of brings it all to life it's a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.450 
app kind of brings it all to life it's a
virtual<00:00:48.300> reality<00:00:48.960> actually<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
virtual reality actually you can see the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.389 
virtual reality actually you can see the
animals<00:00:50.789> moving<00:00:51.180> through<00:00:51.629> yet<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> reason

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
animals moving through yet the reason

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.580

inspired by my year abroad in Hong Kong

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.890 
inspired by my year abroad in Hong Kong
and<00:02:41.650> where<00:02:42.459> people<00:02:42.880> spoke<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.360> lot<00:02:43.630> more<00:02:43.780> than

and where people spoke a lot more than

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.790 
and where people spoke a lot more than
one<00:02:43.989> language<00:02:44.170> or<00:02:44.470> they'll<00:02:44.590> both<00:02:44.769> have

one language or they'll both have

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.370 
one language or they'll both have
speaking<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.640> three<00:02:45.970> languages<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.959> it's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
speaking to three languages and it's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.479 
speaking to three languages and it's
something<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.739> want<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.980> bring<00:02:48.099> over<00:02:48.190> here

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
something I want to bring over here

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.030 
something I want to bring over here
because<00:02:48.880> languages<00:02:49.690> are<00:02:49.989> a<00:02:50.019> detour<00:02:50.620> for
