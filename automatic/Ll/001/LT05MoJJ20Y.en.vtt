00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
480 high of 490 point 3 which i think is

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.480 
480 high of 490 point 3 which i think is
the<00:05:39.250> problem<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:40.120> pellet<00:05:40.479> not<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.840> gun

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
the problem the pellet not the gun

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.719 
the problem the pellet not the gun
average<00:05:42.490> for<00:05:42.970> eighty<00:05:43.270> two<00:05:43.569> point<00:05:43.840> seven<00:05:45.389> and

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
we don't need that the spread is really

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.640 
we don't need that the spread is really
small<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.520> two<00:05:51.759> FPS<00:05:52.210> kind<00:05:53.020> of<00:05:53.080> thing<00:05:53.259> okay<00:05:53.620> so

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
small like two FPS kind of thing okay so
