00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.020
 hi to all the boys and we update to 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.040
 see a beautiful tutorial 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.060
 false cut that called fall stable 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.390
 cat 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.930
 in fact it is made precisely on the table and serves 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.150
 to deceive the viewer we have 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.849
 cut our deck several times 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.960
 cards instead we leave it completely 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.560
 equal 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.560
 Meanwhile let's see 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 here we are guys and this is the fake 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 table cat 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.340
 I put all the red cards and suits 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.309
 black with spades flower paintings to make you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.379
 see that the deck remains completely 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.720
 unchanged the fake table cup would be 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.850
 this is several cuts on the deck there 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.210
 I'll show ok again and then we'll go to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.640
 see that the deck remains completely 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 equal here the flowers and spades 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.899
 how do we do this cut 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.899
 immediately to see 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.869
 this is the explanation 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.179
 of the cut you just saw 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.189
 we have our deck of cards and the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:33.770
 first part starts raising with the index 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.499
 about half of the deck the other hand by hand 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.219
 left with the base of the thumb goes to 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:42.560
 take this part of the bunch so then 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.209
 the turns and immediately takes a break with 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.780
 pinkie 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:50.509
 at the same time the right hand raises 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.899
 about half a pile rests on and the 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.450
 break holds all the cards above 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.060
 the other hand on the right hand rests on the 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.879
 table of the remaining bundle of cards 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.729
 fair might already completed the first 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:07.250
 cut this is the fake and bolted more 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.599
 Short she marked the record for a moment 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.170
 longer 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.180
 we have that we get up around mid- March with 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.310
 the base index of the thumb that goes to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.959
 take the break cards with the little finger 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.950
 let's get up again break 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.299
 we support the same brazen 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.750
 identical thing 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.829
 we raise with the index of the right hand 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.970
 let's take the thumb wide 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:35.060
 let's get up again we rest 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.209
 we support leaning in this way the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.239
 deck remains completely the same ok 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.970
 I revise about half the deck 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.459
 base of the thumb that we take up 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.370
 still break 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.650
 ok let's support all the cards 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.720
 over the break 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.730
 let's get up let's get up again break 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.900
 support a beck card 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.450
 and supported last time we have ours 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.000
 deck of cards 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.380
 we get up around mid March we take with 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.040
 the base of the thumb 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.720
 we raise a little more paper and an eye 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 let's take a break with the best 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.549
 we put the cards in the right hand 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.829
 supported all the houses on three breaks 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's move to the deck in the right hand 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.079
 we raise a bit of break cards 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.879
 we still sing some cards 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:33.310
 we support all the cards under the brand 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.310
 we support it done at speed 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.490
 here it is this was the fake table cat 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.490
 thank you so much
