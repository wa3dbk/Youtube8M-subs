00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
easy to install the first thing you see

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.820 
easy to install the first thing you see
is<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.240> thermal<00:01:18.540> paste<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.049> pre<00:01:19.320> applied<00:01:19.590> down

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
is the thermal paste is pre applied down

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
is the thermal paste is pre applied down
here<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.210> step<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
here one little step out of the way and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
here one little step out of the way and
then<00:01:22.979> we've<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.909> cool<00:01:24.119> retention

then we've got a really cool retention

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
then we've got a really cool retention
system<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.770> Intel<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.310> universal

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
system so for Intel it's universal

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.789 
system so for Intel it's universal
design<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> I'll<00:01:27.840> bring<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> up<00:01:28.170> close<00:01:28.439> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
design and I'll bring it up close you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
design and I'll bring it up close you
can<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.390> three<00:01:30.600> sockets<00:01:30.840> are

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
can see that it's all three sockets are

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.569 
can see that it's all three sockets are
labeled<00:01:31.500> down<00:01:31.680> there<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
labeled down there so if you want to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520 
labeled down there so if you want to
move<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.360> other<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
move from one to the other but then you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.230 
move from one to the other but then you
just<00:01:34.710> grab<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.920> hold<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> thing<00:01:35.490> slide<00:01:36.000> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
just grab a hold of this thing slide it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
just grab a hold of this thing slide it
down<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.630> let<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.409> you've<00:01:37.560> changed

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
down and let go and now you've changed

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.780 
down and let go and now you've changed
position<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.390> back<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.540> 1366<00:01:40.790> back

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
position going to go back to 1366 back

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.490 
position going to go back to 1366 back
up<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.299> done

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
up and that's done

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.160 
up and that's done
so<00:01:45.040> once<00:01:45.310> you've<00:01:45.460> chosen<00:01:45.790> your<00:01:45.970> socket<00:01:46.450> this

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
so once you've chosen your socket this

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.570 
so once you've chosen your socket this
is<00:01:47.320> going<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.530> thread<00:01:47.680> into<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> back<00:01:48.100> place<00:01:48.370> you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
is going to thread into a back place you

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.530 
is going to thread into a back place you
put<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.790> back<00:01:48.940> plate<00:01:49.150> behind<00:01:49.270> your

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
put the back plate behind your

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.630 
put the back plate behind your
motherboard<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.230> then<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.310> list<00:01:51.550> so

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
motherboard and then this is to list so

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.010 
motherboard and then this is to list so
you<00:01:51.730> just<00:01:51.880> take<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.270> in<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.570> your<00:01:52.690> fingers

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
you just take that in with your fingers

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.320 
you just take that in with your fingers
or<00:01:53.200> there's<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.220> slot<00:01:54.820> for<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.090> Phillips

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
or there's a slot for a Phillips

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.580 
or there's a slot for a Phillips
screwdriver<00:01:55.540> if<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:55.990> want<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.260> tighten<00:01:56.410> it

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
screwdriver if you want to tighten it

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.130 
screwdriver if you want to tighten it
with<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.830> screwdriver<00:01:57.070> instead<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:58.810> that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
with the screwdriver instead that's that

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.440 
with the screwdriver instead that's that
of<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.410> way<00:01:59.560> next<00:02:00.550> would<00:02:00.850> be<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.030> mount<00:02:01.330> your

to power the components that's really
easy<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:44.110> there's<00:02:44.290> one<00:02:44.440> connection<00:02:44.800> here

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
easy to so there's one connection here

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.320 
easy to so there's one connection here
that<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.340> need<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.640> put<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.910> your<00:02:45.940> motherboard

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
that you need to put on your motherboard

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.360 
that you need to put on your motherboard
that<00:02:46.810> goes<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.230> four<00:02:47.470> pin<00:02:47.650> header<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.220> your

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
now we're going to show you what it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.020 
now we're going to show you what it
looks<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.080> chassis<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:03.489> here<00:03:03.940> is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
looks like in the chassis so here is

as<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.750> looks<00:03:07.870> different<00:03:08.320> than

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
as you can see it looks different than

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.740 
as you can see it looks different than
any<00:03:08.590> other<00:03:08.680> CPU<00:03:09.160> cooler<00:03:09.400> that's<00:03:10.180> because<00:03:10.600> it

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
any other CPU cooler that's because it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.410 
any other CPU cooler that's because it
is<00:03:10.870> managed<00:03:11.440> actually<00:03:11.920> has<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.130> brain<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:13.239> it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
is managed actually has a brain so it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.120 
is managed actually has a brain so it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
knows what it's doing it can tell you

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.220 
knows what it's doing it can tell you
what<00:03:15.280> it's<00:03:15.459> doing<00:03:15.790> on<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.209> LCD<00:03:16.540> screen<00:03:16.690> here

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and as we'll see you can actually make

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.560 
and as we'll see you can actually make
it<00:03:20.110> work<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.530> way<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.650> want<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.160> work<00:03:21.570> what

it work the way you want it to work what
it's<00:03:22.720> telling<00:03:22.870> me<00:03:23.080> on<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> info<00:03:23.590> display<00:03:23.950> is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
it's telling me on the info display is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.080 
it's telling me on the info display is

on my pumps at 2100 rpm at the bottom it

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.160 
on my pumps at 2100 rpm at the bottom it
tells<00:03:33.580> me<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.760> I'm<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.060> a<00:03:34.239> performance<00:03:34.690> mode

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
tells me that I'm in a performance mode

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.009 
tells me that I'm in a performance mode
if<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.950> go<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.580> my<00:03:36.790> buttons<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.269> my<00:03:37.300> LCD<00:03:37.720> screen

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
if I go to my buttons on my LCD screen

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.259 
if I go to my buttons on my LCD screen
here<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.440> can<00:03:39.100> just<00:03:39.130> go<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.459> my<00:03:39.610> settings<00:03:39.820> screen

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
here I can just go to my settings screen

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.110 
here I can just go to my settings screen
I<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.320> down<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.560> mode<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.220> choose<00:03:42.790> an

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
I can go down to mode and choose an

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.320 
I can go down to mode and choose an
extreme<00:03:43.510> mode<00:03:43.750> or<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.709> quiet<00:03:44.980> mode<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:46.180> that's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
extreme mode or a quiet mode so that's

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.509 
extreme mode or a quiet mode so that's
great<00:03:46.630> because<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.080> allows<00:03:47.260> one<00:03:47.769> cooler<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.430> be

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
great because it allows one cooler to be

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.160 
great because it allows one cooler to be
interesting<00:03:49.030> for<00:03:49.209> lots<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.510> different<00:03:49.810> users

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
interesting for lots of different users

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.110 
interesting for lots of different users
if<00:03:50.470> you're<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.459> looking<00:03:51.730> for<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> quiet

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
if you're just looking for a quiet

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.270 
if you're just looking for a quiet
computer<00:03:52.660> put<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.319> on<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.530> quiet<00:03:53.800> mode<00:03:54.069> and

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
computer put it on the quiet mode and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.809 
computer put it on the quiet mode and
that<00:03:54.370> fan

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
that fan

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.259 
that fan
we'll<00:03:54.909> never<00:03:55.060> ramp<00:03:55.450> up<00:03:55.689> and<00:03:56.879> then<00:03:57.879> if<00:03:57.999> you<00:03:58.090> want

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
we'll never ramp up and then if you want

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.089 
we'll never ramp up and then if you want
big<00:03:58.480> overclocks<00:03:58.959> go<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.290> extreme<00:03:59.709> mode<00:03:59.889> and

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
big overclocks go to extreme mode and

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.800 
big overclocks go to extreme mode and
that<00:04:00.219> fan<00:04:00.459> will<00:04:00.670> respond<00:04:01.060> more<00:04:01.269> aggressively

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
that fan will respond more aggressively

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.729 
that fan will respond more aggressively
to<00:04:02.049> changes<00:04:02.499> in<00:04:02.530> temperature<00:04:02.829> of<00:04:03.249> the<00:04:03.760> liquid

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
to changes in temperature of the liquid

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.899 
to changes in temperature of the liquid
since<00:04:05.739> it<00:04:05.889> is<00:04:06.010> smart<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.459> can<00:04:06.579> tell<00:04:06.790> you

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
since it is smart it can tell you

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.209 
since it is smart it can tell you
whether<00:04:07.150> it's<00:04:07.389> happy<00:04:07.719> or<00:04:07.810> not<00:04:07.900> so<00:04:08.859> if<00:04:09.099> you

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:09.219 
whether it's happy or not so if you

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.860 
whether it's happy or not so if you
block<00:04:09.430> your<00:04:09.579> fan<00:04:09.849> or<00:04:10.120> your<00:04:10.239> fan<00:04:10.450> gets<00:04:10.629> blocked

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
block your fan or your fan gets blocked

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.390 
block your fan or your fan gets blocked
somehow<00:04:11.349> and<00:04:11.560> your<00:04:11.680> cooler<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.040> not<00:04:12.189> going<00:04:12.340> to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
somehow and your cooler is not going to

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.039 
somehow and your cooler is not going to
be<00:04:12.489> happy<00:04:12.879> so<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.239> going<00:04:13.389> to<00:04:13.480> beep<00:04:13.689> at<00:04:13.870> you

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
be happy so it's going to beep at you

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.349 
be happy so it's going to beep at you
like<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.439> it<00:04:15.099> flashes<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.909> then<00:04:16.060> when<00:04:16.239> the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
like that it flashes and then when the

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.819 
like that it flashes and then when the
obstruction<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:16.810> removed<00:04:17.109> then<00:04:17.410> it's<00:04:17.650> going

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
obstruction is removed then it's going

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.400 
obstruction is removed then it's going
to<00:04:17.889> start<00:04:18.099> itself<00:04:18.489> back<00:04:18.789> up<00:04:19.019> same<00:04:20.019> thing<00:04:20.229> goes

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
to start itself back up same thing goes

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.520 
to start itself back up same thing goes

light pulse you can make it flash on and

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.700 
light pulse you can make it flash on and
off<00:04:45.970> like<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:47.050> can<00:04:47.199> also<00:04:47.320> change<00:04:47.590> the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
off like that you can also change the

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.469 
off like that you can also change the
orientation<00:04:47.949> of<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.669> screen<00:04:48.970> so<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:49.270> you

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
orientation of the screen so if you

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.999 
orientation of the screen so if you
mounted<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.930> head<00:04:50.110> instead<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.500> sideways<00:04:50.770> you

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
mounted the head instead of sideways you

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.279 
mounted the head instead of sideways you
mounted<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.460> up<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.729> down<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.690> screen<00:04:53.080> will

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
mounted it up and down that screen will

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.909 
mounted it up and down that screen will
flip<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:54.099> can<00:04:54.310> read<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.550> more<00:04:55.060> easily<00:04:55.919> this

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
flip so you can read it more easily this

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.560 
flip so you can read it more easily this
is<00:04:56.979> all<00:04:57.190> stuff<00:04:57.639> that's<00:04:57.669> that's<00:04:58.300> useful
