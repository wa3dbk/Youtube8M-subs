 he asks so you were already been 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.789
 silver medalist in the past 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.439
 now hold on to know how that 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.439
 it's like being a manon gold medal 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.970
 from japan to english or years so 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.940
 I had heart won because 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.670
 I missed a final and in 2009 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.379
 so here I was passed by 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.180
 today I bet on 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.500
 go down in the category because 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.059
 after the Olympics I went 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:52.059
 and it pays so we try time a 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.059
 itunes petit claude feutheu not enough 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 catherine the wonder exactly what is 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.430
 what made you go back 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.850
 of a goal category had gone up to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.800
 the heckmann era intervened let's say 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.340
 I have been a gta 96 points 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.799
 you changed it iron third 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.659
 we 'll be watching from europe but I'm 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.759
 realized that I was too light for 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.679
 the catÃ© is actually I make myself a 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.079
 first second third match after 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.490
 I have the level that because it's 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.659
 much more difficult with the most 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.859
 heavy on all categories have 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.439
 changed it is much higher 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.630
 now move forward 96 06 98 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.740
 and so that's it to win a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.000
 competition to go all the way 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.219
 in the background that I made the bet of 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.539
 jealousy more physics in this 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:58.560
 category there who are active in match 3 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.869
 who says denis all Western energy 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.750
 antoine pons who says it is just to go 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.750
 back to he is well and no quinoa keith
