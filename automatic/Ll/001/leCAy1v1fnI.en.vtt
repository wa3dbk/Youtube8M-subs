shoes and your chalk bag and the power

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.420 
shoes and your chalk bag and the power
of<00:01:09.640> mind<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:11.290> also<00:01:11.470> very<00:01:11.770> profound

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 

reason<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.299> probably<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> ultimate<00:01:15.899> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
reason it's probably the ultimate is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.980 
reason it's probably the ultimate is
this<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.979> wrong<00:01:17.340> move<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:18.840> fall<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.740> die

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
this one wrong move you fall you die

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
this one wrong move you fall you die

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
yeah let me try that again and the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.350 
yeah let me try that again and the
person<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.020> top<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.009> game<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.700> it's
