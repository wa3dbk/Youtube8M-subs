 In this video here I'll show you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.920
 how to disable the tips and aids item 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.649
 here from windows 8.1 rock 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.530
 many people are bothered by this 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.010
 application let's say so from windows 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 8.1 then we have an alternative 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 disable it here okay then remembering that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.649
 I'm using the professional version here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.449
 of windows 8.1 let's aquino run eu 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 I'm using the shortcut key here 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 windows but the letter r 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.840
 Okay, I use this shortcut to open it. 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.989
 here to run it 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.280
 here we will enter here the gp edith point 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.549
 msc 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.700
 remembering that in the single language version 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.460
 we do not have the gp dite point msc 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.610
 But in the video description I'm 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.220
 placing two records files one 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.020
 this alternative here in gp diponto msc 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.060
 does not apply to the singular version in the game 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.549

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:11.030
