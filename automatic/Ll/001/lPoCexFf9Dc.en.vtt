00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.710 
Sonic lost world was announced I was
really<00:00:59.640> pumped<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.089> what<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.540> be

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.630 
really pumped to see what it would be
like<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.229> then<00:01:01.379> gameplay<00:01:01.979> video<00:01:02.220> has<00:01:02.370> started

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

exciting gameplay style of running and
platforming<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:38.459> this<00:01:38.940> gameplay<00:01:39.209> style<00:01:39.780> which

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
platforming to this gameplay style which

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.870 
platforming to this gameplay style which
is<00:01:40.050> primarily<00:01:40.560> walking<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.399> then<00:01:41.489> you<00:01:41.580> begin

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
is primarily walking and then you begin

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.609 
is primarily walking and then you begin
to<00:01:41.940> run<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.509> stop<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.959> kill<00:01:43.110> enemies<00:01:43.440> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
to run then you stop to kill enemies and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.650 
to run then you stop to kill enemies and
then<00:01:43.709> continue<00:01:44.130> on<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.520> very<00:01:45.119> tedious

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
then continue on it's very tedious

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.630 
then continue on it's very tedious
there<00:01:46.080> are<00:01:46.170> tons<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.679> tons<00:01:46.709> of<00:01:47.039> tons<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.610> tons

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
there are tons and tons of tons and tons

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
there are tons and tons of tons and tons
of<00:01:48.239> unfair<00:01:48.660> deaths<00:01:48.959> in<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.229> game<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.739> thought

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of unfair deaths in this game I thought

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.559 
of unfair deaths in this game I thought
myself<00:01:50.280> putting<00:01:50.700> down<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> controller<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
myself putting down the controller and

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.850 
myself putting down the controller and
not<00:01:51.750> point<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.229> days<00:01:52.380> because<00:01:52.679> of<00:01:52.770> how

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
not point for days because of how

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
not point for days because of how
frustrating<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.300> new<00:01:54.450> gimmick<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
frustrating it was the new gimmick in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.690 
frustrating it was the new gimmick in
this<00:01:55.619> game<00:01:55.830> is<00:01:56.039> that<00:01:56.130> each<00:01:56.310> level<00:01:56.520> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this game is that each level is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.339 
this game is that each level is
basically<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.149> cylinder<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> Sonic<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.200> go

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
basically a cylinder and Sonic can go

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:59.719 
basically a cylinder and Sonic can go
around<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.709> full<00:01:58.920> thing<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.340> take<00:01:59.520> different

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
around the full thing to take different

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.699 
around the full thing to take different
paths<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.690> like<00:02:00.989> this<00:02:01.110> concept<00:02:01.619> but

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
paths I actually like this concept but
