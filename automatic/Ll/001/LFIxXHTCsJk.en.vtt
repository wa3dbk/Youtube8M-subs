 Hello everyone everyone in this video tutorial I 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.519
 I will show you and tell you about two programs. 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 test programs c paunchy gps and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.240
 different program although they are called by 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.240
 one but they are from different 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
 developers 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 paused serve to learn 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.220
 model processor and its other functions 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 and its fee is video memory so 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.570
 further here is the very first model here 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.600
 athlon processor i have athlon 2 i have 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.559
 This is the Russified version if you 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.430
 will download 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.430
 then you will most likely find English 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:57.289
 version if you do not enter into the search engine rus 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:01:00.629
 let's see how it is about what 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.870
 The first course model said 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.270
 the code name of the processor that's all 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.939
 the processor is an internal version 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.549
 processor all backup hydra 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.030
 the processor 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:18.049
 cleanliness and room 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:23.130
 clock frequency is how much do you have 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.780
 acceleration at the core of one I overclocked core 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.780
 by 3-4 megahertz 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.000
 standard my fight standard my 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.450
 clock frequency 2 ideas 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.060
 i overclocked using these programs 3 and 4 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 I overclocked of course with the help of these slave 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.790
 and dispersed about the program via bios 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
 we 'll talk a little later 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.670
 using this program i just 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.670
 tested I watched studied 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:05.670
 processor cache information level 2 1 2 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.399
 here multiplied by 464 and here by 1024 well, I 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.619
 I don't use it and by the way here 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.280
 selected processor i have a processor 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.530
 worth one but if you 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.020
 there are several processes connected wider 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.390
 so you can choose 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.590
 I have only two active cores 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 and processes i'm a dry processor not 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.510
 the same seems to me well, here's porridge 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.790
 so let's see the fee 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.600
 I am a producer of matter and revision 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.709
 ssr 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:49.900
 rock model there chipset and so 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:55.000
 then I have all the nb memory in general r3 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:12.900
 triples gigabyte me of course old 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:17.230
 com spd don't even understand the lot number 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:22.620
 produce in the memory module ddr3 triples 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.620
 video system here minimalism 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.620
 selection of devices display me advice 1 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.760
 Vityuha so much and maybe like stage 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.860
 the pains on there how to look I'm not in this 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.860
 understand somehow maybe you just do not have 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.299
 here he is your name and manufacturer 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.769
 frequency i'm here minimalism 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:04:00.609
 let's go to the second program 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:05.380
 gpu-z here started 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:08.470
 here we have everything about the video system 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.150
 saw a picture of it here, too, something more 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.400
 tells in detail 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:20.789
 from her radeon hd 5450 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:25.760
 even a teapot will pick it up 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:33.160
 bios version you can leave it 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.160
 the release date of the 2010 plot in 1904 he 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.670
 was going in one year all type 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.480
 gddr3 video memory 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.730
 samsung size video memory size 1024 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:01.910
 megabyte although there we have written 2 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:05.680
 gigov stata processor 650 800 here 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:11.600
 sensors is the biggest thing that is better 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:16.550
 here you are, after all, in passing, if you 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.290
 very with very old comp then you 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.070
 may not be such sensors inside 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.400
 computer 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.710
 the buttons are small-small these statues and 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.540
 pull everything like say what does it mean 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.340
 to earn 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:35.470
 CPU max load 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.470
 value 94 current core temperature 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.330
 a maximum of 49 is not easy this is all 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.100
 decreases arrows overclocked standard 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.720
 cooler 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:53.350
 or buyer stakes I'll figure it out myself 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:59.950
 check this one is sent to had 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:02.300
 check all everyone thanks for watching 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.190
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.190
 like comments to everyone for now
