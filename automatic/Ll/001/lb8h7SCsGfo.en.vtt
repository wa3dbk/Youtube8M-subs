00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.480
 hi youtube today a little 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.280
 video actually to show you how 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.840
 put your sleeping bag in its 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 cover without taking the head 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.639
 I think everyone has already had this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.340
 problem it is very easy to unpack 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.920
 and when comes the moment of their packed 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 and well it's great galÃ¨re what we try 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 of the roll to bend in four 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.189
 eight and it never comes back and suddenly 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.019
 I will show you a little video 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.750
 all stupid 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.850
 a technique for storing your bag of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.130
 sleeping so good south without really getting 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.290
 take the lead and that's the way the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 simpler that is actually we will come 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.270
 catch the sleeping bag by 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.230
 feet and their entry makes it strong 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.989
 in the method cover a way a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.149
 a little bit rough you'll see I 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.149
 will show you in a minute chrono 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:04.129
 so I take the cover I grab the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.129
 foot of the sleeping bag 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.829
 and I will come back so in his 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.090
 cover and I go stuffing m the cover 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.090
 like that little by little 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:54.090
 and that's actually it's a way 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.090
 super simple 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.350
 that's more headache so in fact 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.380
 do not try to roll it or 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.060
 folding 4 where there is no technique in 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.730
 does the only technique is the ranger 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.880
 in fact I'm going to say in shit pile 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 in its cover and it's the most 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.260
 simple to put it away and after we had 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.330
 drawstrings that will allow 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.850
 so to pack it up to remove the air that 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.670
 is in to still have a volume 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.820
 even smaller and that's it's a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.920
 technical stupid but that allows to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.580
 so put away his sleeping bag without getting 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.070
 take the lead 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.959
 here I hope that this technique you 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.959
 will have pleased and then that youtube
