00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
to give me the temperature reading in

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.260 
to give me the temperature reading in
the<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.549> pit<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> chimney<00:01:29.270> so

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the in the pit and then the chimney so

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
the in the pit and then the chimney so
I've<00:01:30.420> got<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> temperature<00:01:31.079> set<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.500> right

now<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.900> 205<00:01:33.900> degrees<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.570> think<00:01:36.570> with

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
now at 205 degrees and I think with

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.710 
now at 205 degrees and I think with
charcoal<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.640> controller<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.450> work

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
charcoal the controller would work

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.850 
charcoal the controller would work
absolutely<00:01:39.960> perfect

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
absolutely perfect

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.149 
absolutely perfect

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
burning wood it keeps it in very close

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.149 
burning wood it keeps it in very close
proximity<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:46.020> occasionally<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.890> keep<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
proximity and occasionally will keep it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.090 
proximity and occasionally will keep it
right<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.210> temperature<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.409> compared<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
right on the temperature but compared to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.060 
right on the temperature but compared to
prior<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> having<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.420> unit<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.680> difference

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
prior to having this unit the difference

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.240 
prior to having this unit the difference
is<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.780> night<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> day<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:56.100> certainly

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
is is night and day you can certainly

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 
is is night and day you can certainly
tell<00:01:56.579> when<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> fans<00:01:57.180> come<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.600> I'll<00:01:58.229> take<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
tell when the fans come on I'll take you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.550 
tell when the fans come on I'll take you
around<00:01:58.829> back<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.560> see

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
around back here so you can actually see

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.670 
around back here so you can actually see
the<00:02:01.770> fans<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.829> those<00:02:05.009> are<00:02:05.540> 225<00:02:06.540> cubic<00:02:07.140> foot<00:02:07.439> per
