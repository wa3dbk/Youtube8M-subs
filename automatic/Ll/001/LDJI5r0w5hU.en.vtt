00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.030
 Hi, I'm Carlos MartÃ­n. This deception 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.510
 Spanish we have here the new sony nex 6 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.860
 you already know the new model of the brand 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.590
 says that halfway between the new 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.660
 sony 5r and the next 7 what not for it 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.210
 offers few features you already know 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.390
 has a psc sensor of 16 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.390
 megapixels 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.780
 includes also 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.170
 viewer or led included the annex 7 the same 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.539
 screen with the same resolution 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.949
 we also have this folding screen 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.949
 with the same mechanism of the next 7 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 the integrated 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.109
 I have seen a new control a new dial 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.970
 same as we have this thread 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:58.260
 they suffered around here 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.910
 the lower one that also rotates from this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.140
 form disappears the trine and here 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.140
 we have your plans 7 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.740
 these two are real 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.590
 the two worlds here 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.179
 lower 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.859
 the shoe of the 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.859
 flash on this occasion 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.820
 has changed the proprietary format of 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.650
 sound to one more universal being able to place 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 flashes from other manufacturers 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.260
 leaving the anec 7 well then it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.830
 you need installer here to 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.830
 transform 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.770
 and it would stay the same 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 forward we could say for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.829
 provide greater compatibility with 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.920
 other manufacturers good going back to the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.259
 next 6 we have already seen the similarities and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.210
 differences 17 should comment on new 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.970
 features that has been included as 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:06.329
 the wi-fi connection to offer those 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.220
 applications we could already see with the hello 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.440
 5r for example we have the menu 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.180
 application 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.970
 we would have all those functions of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.620
 order the cloud remote control to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.220
 through an android device guayos 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.400
 etc 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.920
 and also the gps connectivity for 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.580
 geolocate but label the photos 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.630
 that we do so including in hard wedge 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.410
 the function button 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.360
 the change detached off 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
 we have the same as the next 7 as already 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.790
 we say is the day where the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.790
 differences 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.540
 so good these are 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.700
 the first impressions of the next 6 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.920
 As you can see it is very similar to 7 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.630
 just good because that we lose in 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.330
 7 megapixels stays with 24 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.130
 megapixel is with 16 but not for that 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.510
 still interesting even 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.440
 we could say that it is more 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.440
 interesting that the action 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.390
 and those are the first impressions of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 the anec 6 in the photo that 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 all right
