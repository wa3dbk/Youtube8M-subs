hey<00:00:07.170> YouTube<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.890> am<00:00:08.250> sort<00:00:08.969> of<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.090> theory<00:00:09.480> that

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
hey YouTube I am sort of a theory that

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
hey YouTube I am sort of a theory that
that<00:00:11.400> maybe<00:00:11.610> my<00:00:11.850> spark<00:00:12.270> plug<00:00:12.299> was<00:00:12.750> getting

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
that maybe my spark plug was getting

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.930 
that maybe my spark plug was getting
fouled

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
fouled

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.740 
fouled
I<00:00:14.969> showed<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.510> video<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.150> in<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.300> previous

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I showed a video in the in a previous

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.240 
I showed a video in the in a previous
the<00:00:19.140> previous<00:00:19.530> video<00:00:20.269> the<00:00:21.269> spark<00:00:21.570> plug<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
the previous video the spark plug so I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
the previous video the spark plug so I
got<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.429> and<00:00:23.580> sanded<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.689> bit<00:00:25.730> see

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
got it and sanded it up a little bit see

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.329 
got it and sanded it up a little bit see
if<00:00:26.759> maybe<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.720> maybe<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.050> helps<00:00:28.410> cuz<00:00:28.619> very

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:29.339 
if maybe so maybe this helps cuz very

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.690 
if maybe so maybe this helps cuz very
first<00:00:29.640> day<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> run<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.749> scooter<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.700> hydroxy

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
first day I run the scooter on hydroxy

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510 
first day I run the scooter on hydroxy
gas<00:00:33.020> it<00:00:34.020> seemed<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.440> run<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> lot<00:00:34.920> better<00:00:35.160> than

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
gas it seemed to run a lot better than

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.140 
gas it seemed to run a lot better than
it<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.730> now

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
it is now

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.890 
it is now
so<00:00:36.540> I'm<00:00:37.380> gonna<00:00:37.560> try<00:00:38.180> seeing<00:00:39.180> if<00:00:39.390> cleaning<00:00:39.810> up

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
so I'm gonna try seeing if cleaning up

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.980 
so I'm gonna try seeing if cleaning up
the<00:00:40.050> spark<00:00:40.290> plug<00:00:40.640> makes<00:00:41.640> any<00:00:41.820> difference<00:00:42.060> so

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.020 

yeah<00:00:45.990> so<00:00:46.380> that's<00:00:46.560> what<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.160> okay

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
yeah so that's what I'm gonna do okay

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
yeah so that's what I'm gonna do okay
like<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.540> said<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> last<00:00:48.990> video<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.890> believe

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
like I said in the last video I believe

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.710 
like I said in the last video I believe
that<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.330> spark<00:00:52.260> plug<00:00:52.530> may<00:00:52.740> have<00:00:52.890> become<00:00:53.370> be

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
that the spark plug may have become be

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.330 
that the spark plug may have become be
have<00:00:54.720> been<00:00:54.750> becoming<00:00:55.410> fouled<00:00:56.330> from<00:00:57.330> running

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
have been becoming fouled from running

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.970 
have been becoming fouled from running
from<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.520> running<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> hydroxy<00:01:00.630> gas

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
from what running the hydroxy gas

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
from what running the hydroxy gas
through<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> through<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.090> through<00:01:03.630> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
through the through the through the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
through the through the through the
engine<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.729> believe<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> main<00:01:06.420> reason<00:01:06.780> for

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
engine and I believe the main reason for

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.070 
engine and I believe the main reason for
that<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.490> water<00:01:08.490> coming<00:01:09.270> through<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:09.900> getting

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that is water coming through and getting

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.650 
that is water coming through and getting
in<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.940> because<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.120> seems<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
in there and because it seems like the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.170 
in there and because it seems like the
first<00:01:12.870> time<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.080> did<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.560> setup<00:01:13.910> it<00:01:14.910> ran

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
first time I did this setup it ran

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
first time I did this setup it ran
really<00:01:15.420> well<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.740> ever<00:01:17.070> since<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
really well and then ever since it's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240 
really well and then ever since it's
been<00:01:17.790> progressively<00:01:18.330> getting<00:01:18.570> worse<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
been progressively getting worse so I I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.399 
been progressively getting worse so I I
took<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> spark<00:01:21.390> plug<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.870> and<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
took out the spark plug in it and it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.649 
took out the spark plug in it and it
looked<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> may<00:01:23.190> have<00:01:23.670> been<00:01:23.850> becoming

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
looked like it may have been becoming

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.460 
looked like it may have been becoming
fouled<00:01:25.050> so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.440> took<00:01:25.560> piece<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.460> sandpaper<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
fouled so I took piece of sandpaper and

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.120 
fouled so I took piece of sandpaper and
rubbed<00:01:28.470> off<00:01:30.020> rubbed<00:01:31.020> off<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> electrodes<00:01:31.800> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
rubbed off rubbed off the electrodes so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.360 
rubbed off rubbed off the electrodes so
I<00:01:32.840> here<00:01:33.840> I'll<00:01:33.990> show<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> got<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.159> I

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
I here I'll show you what I got here I

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.920 
I here I'll show you what I got here I
have<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:38.000> piece<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> tubing<00:01:39.330> here<00:01:39.659> filled

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
have a a piece of tubing here filled

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.899 
have a a piece of tubing here filled
with<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.170> desiccant<00:01:40.650> material<00:01:41.220> called<00:01:41.580> dry

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
with a desiccant material called dry

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.469 
with a desiccant material called dry
right<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.590> should<00:01:43.850> get<00:01:44.850> rid<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.150> take

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
right and that should get rid of take

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.810 
right and that should get rid of take
care<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.780> water<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.320> me<00:01:46.470> here's<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.580> flow

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
care of the water for me here's the flow

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.580 
care of the water for me here's the flow
meter<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:50.180> show<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.960> another<00:01:52.229> video

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
meter and I show to have another video

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.360 
meter and I show to have another video
showing<00:01:53.060> how<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> convert<00:01:54.600> from<00:01:55.190> cubic<00:01:56.190> feet

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
showing how to convert from cubic feet

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.539 
showing how to convert from cubic feet
per<00:01:56.640> hour<00:01:56.720> for<00:01:57.720> air<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.370> milliliters<00:01:59.370> per

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
per hour for air to milliliters per

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.910 
per hour for air to milliliters per
minute<00:01:59.729> for<00:02:00.120> hydroxy<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.670> at<00:02:02.670> running<00:02:03.210> full

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
minute for hydroxy and at running full

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.969 
minute for hydroxy and at running full
this<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.700> cell<00:02:07.099> is<00:02:08.099> putting<00:02:08.549> out<00:02:08.729> about<00:02:09.979> 6

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
this this cell is putting out about 6

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.199 
this this cell is putting out about 6
between<00:02:11.819> 6<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.450> 7<00:02:13.219> cubic<00:02:14.219> feet<00:02:14.430> per<00:02:14.670> hour<00:02:14.819> for

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.550 
between 6 and 7 cubic feet per hour for
air

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560 

so<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.400> can<00:02:19.580> look<00:02:19.730> back<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:19.970> my<00:02:20.360> previous

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
so you can look back to my previous

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.900 
so you can look back to my previous
video<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.320> do<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.400> calculation<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:25.760> new

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
video and do that calculation so the new

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.980 
video and do that calculation so the new
set<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.330> tests<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:28.430> I'm<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.030> repeat

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
set of tests here I'm going to repeat

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.300 
set of tests here I'm going to repeat
some<00:02:30.290> stuff<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.890> see<00:02:31.480> see<00:02:32.480> if<00:02:32.690> if<00:02:33.410> there<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.280> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
some stuff and see see if if there is a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.900 
some stuff and see see if if there is a
prevent<00:02:34.910> from<00:02:35.240> cleaning<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.110> spark<00:02:36.410> plug

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.020 
prevent from cleaning up the spark plug
so<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:37.940> enjoy<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> video<00:02:39.820> okay

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
so I enjoy the video okay

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.630 
so I enjoy the video okay
the<00:02:41.720> first<00:02:41.990> test<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:42.740> I<00:02:42.770> will<00:02:43.660> get<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:45.640> gas

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the first test here I will get the gas

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
the first test here I will get the gas
in<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:48.020> from<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.740> carburetor<00:02:50.170> repeating

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
in and from the carburetor repeating

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.940 
in and from the carburetor repeating
kind<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.590> how<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:52.180> originally<00:02:53.440> my<00:02:54.440> original

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
kind of how I originally my original

00:02:54.950 --> 00:04:03.080 
kind of how I originally my original
tests<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:58.300> let's<00:02:59.300> try<00:02:59.660> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.760 

okay<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:04.890> have<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.160> running<00:04:05.370> now<00:04:06.140> I'm<00:04:07.140> going<00:04:07.500> to

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
okay we have it running now I'm going to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:29.000 
okay we have it running now I'm going to
put<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.130> cork<00:04:10.430> in

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:43.390 

okay<00:04:30.010> let's<00:04:30.400> try<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.730> again

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.500 

okay

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
okay

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.600 
okay
that<00:04:46.110> seems<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.560> be<00:04:46.590> running<00:04:46.980> quite<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.430> bit

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
that seems to be running quite a bit

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.180 
that seems to be running quite a bit
better<00:04:47.820> I<00:04:48.260> think<00:04:49.260> I<00:04:49.470> am

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
better I think I am

00:04:51.190 --> 00:05:09.379 
better I think I am
some<00:04:51.370> gas

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:31.610 

I'll<00:05:09.990> restrict<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.740> air<00:05:10.919> a<00:05:10.949> little<00:05:11.219> bit

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.460 

okay<00:05:32.310> this<00:05:32.520> time<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.970> seems<00:05:33.210> like<00:05:33.450> that<00:05:34.320> it's

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
okay this time it seems like that it's

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.410 
okay this time it seems like that it's
probably<00:05:34.680> has<00:05:35.220> pretty<00:05:35.580> close<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.240> right

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
probably has pretty close to the right

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:44.080 
probably has pretty close to the right
air<00:05:37.140> fuel<00:05:37.470> ratio<00:05:40.730> I'm<00:05:41.730> interested<00:05:42.480> to<00:05:42.990> see

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
air fuel ratio I'm interested to see

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.320 
air fuel ratio I'm interested to see
this

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
this

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:57.950 
this
to<00:05:53.810> guess<00:05:54.810> that<00:05:55.020> killed<00:05:55.380> it<00:05:55.560> let<00:05:55.800> me<00:05:56.840> start<00:05:57.840> it

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
to guess that killed it let me start it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:23.330 
to guess that killed it let me start it
up<00:05:58.080> again

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:36.370 

okay<00:06:23.910> let's<00:06:24.750> see<00:06:24.930> if<00:06:25.020> we<00:06:25.110> can<00:06:25.320> trial<00:06:25.680> it

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:52.390 

seems<00:06:36.740> like<00:06:36.920> we<00:06:37.100> got<00:06:37.220> the<00:06:37.460> request

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.990 

that<00:06:53.400> was<00:06:53.520> pretty<00:06:53.700> good

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
that was pretty good

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.640 
that was pretty good
okay<00:06:58.130> so<00:06:59.130> it<00:06:59.430> it<00:07:00.270> seems<00:07:00.660> like<00:07:00.990> that<00:07:01.320> a<00:07:01.380> lot<00:07:01.620> of

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
okay so it it seems like that a lot of

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.879 
okay so it it seems like that a lot of
the<00:07:02.600> difference<00:07:03.600> there<00:07:03.900> what<00:07:04.169> had<00:07:04.380> to<00:07:04.500> do<00:07:04.680> with

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
the difference there what had to do with

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:13.879 
the difference there what had to do with
the<00:07:07.790> with<00:07:08.790> the<00:07:10.460> air<00:07:11.460> fuel<00:07:11.720> I'm<00:07:12.720> sorry<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.620> size

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 
the with the air fuel I'm sorry the size

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.510 
the with the air fuel I'm sorry the size
of<00:07:14.100> the<00:07:14.310> the<00:07:14.730> size<00:07:14.760> of<00:07:15.150> the<00:07:15.300> tubing<00:07:15.720> here<00:07:16.520> I'm

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
of the the size of the tubing here I'm

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.260 
of the the size of the tubing here I'm
going<00:07:17.700> to<00:07:17.820> do<00:07:18.000> make<00:07:18.630> a<00:07:18.660> little<00:07:18.840> adjustment<00:07:19.470> and

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
going to do make a little adjustment and

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.650 
going to do make a little adjustment and
I'll<00:07:21.270> show<00:07:21.510> you<00:07:21.540> what<00:07:21.750> I<00:07:21.780> did<00:07:21.930> when<00:07:22.290> I'm<00:07:22.440> done
