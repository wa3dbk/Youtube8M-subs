00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.319
 hello how are we we are full of 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.720
 mix lópez and mauricio trejo vázquez 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.850
 what we are going to explain in this tutorial 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.170
 is how to add multiply divide and 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:19.400
 subtract 2 complex numbers we have 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.970
 5 + 4 and for example 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.970
 plus 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.550
 4 more 8 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.559
 when we put the values ​​between 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:36.250
 parentheses at the moment of giving enter 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.110
 will give the result of happiness of said 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.899
 sum and it will be already going to be 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.320
 separated what are the two in the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.899
 real numbers and complex numbers 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 this applies to what the sum is 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.680
 multiplication and division 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.610
 let's use the same term 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.130
 but changing the cycle 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.040
 in a subtraction the result will be 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.330
 different the same as if we do with 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.330
 a division 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.090
 and a multiplication 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.410
 now my partner I will teach 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.410
 another method a little easier 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.920
 good for this method let's assign 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.670
 values ​​to a variable for example to va 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.409
 to be equal 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:36.340
 as in this case 54 de iu 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.460
 semicolon 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.600
 v 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.600
 It will be the same 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.070
 48 de iu 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.070
 semicolon 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.650
 and ready we have the assigned values 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.650
 here 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:04.070
 now we just do the sum of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.080
 a plus b we press enter 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.080
 and this would be the result 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.110
 d 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.590
 this would be your results 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.720
 d 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.720
 this would be the result 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.220
 between 20 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.220
 that would be the result
