00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.659 
damn it and a chamois leather is really
chewy<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.889> imagine<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:56.549> the

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
chewy so you can imagine that's like the

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.309 
chewy so you can imagine that's like the
skin<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.449> these<00:03:57.599> discrete<00:03:57.989> like

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
skin so you like these discrete like

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.140 
skin so you like these discrete like
it's<00:03:58.530> descriptive<00:03:58.980> writing<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.790> crunchy

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
it's descriptive writing the crunchy

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.640 
it's descriptive writing the crunchy
bits<00:04:00.299> like<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.599> bones<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.319> yeah

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
bits like the bones and that yeah

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.009 
bits like the bones and that yeah
perfect<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.180> know<00:04:03.329> Carl<00:04:03.750> it's

there<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.209> way<00:04:06.359> that<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> first

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
there and in a way that is the first

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.500 
there and in a way that is the first
step<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.680> maybe<00:04:08.040> doing<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.430> new<00:04:08.579> english<00:04:08.940> GCSE

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
step on maybe doing a new english GCSE
