goods that said to me ok no problem with
my<00:01:25.770> battery<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:27.030> next<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.930> wanted

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
my battery the next thing was I wanted

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
my battery the next thing was I wanted
to<00:01:28.409> find<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> problem<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.640> my

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to find out there was a problem with my

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
to find out there was a problem with my
starter<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> took<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.259> look<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.860> here's<00:01:32.369> all

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
starter so I took a look here here's all

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.770 
starter so I took a look here here's all
the<00:01:32.670> fuses<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.210> everything<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> everything

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the fuses and everything and everything

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
the fuses and everything and everything
looked<00:01:34.200> good<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.530> fuses<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
looked good for fuses and all that and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999 
looked good for fuses and all that and
so<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> thought<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> next<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.890> do

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so I thought the next thing I have to do

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.469 
so I thought the next thing I have to do
is<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.790> hopefully<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.299> see

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
is go down in here hopefully you can see

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
is go down in here hopefully you can see
this<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.409> see<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> yellow<00:01:40.710> wire<00:01:41.130> I've

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this and you see the yellow wire I've

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
this and you see the yellow wire I've
got<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> black<00:01:41.869> covering<00:01:42.869> off<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
got the black covering off of it so you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139 
got the black covering off of it so you
can<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.430> yellow<00:01:44.610> wire<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.090> goes

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
can see it the yellow wire that goes

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.530 
can see it the yellow wire that goes
down<00:01:45.479> into<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> starter<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.950> measured<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.299> 12

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
down into the starter I measured with 12

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
down into the starter I measured with 12
voltages<00:01:49.020> put<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:50.130> meter<00:01:50.340> lead<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
voltages put my my meter lead on the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
voltages put my my meter lead on the
negative<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.380> positive<00:01:52.979> down

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
negative here and I put my positive down

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.670 
negative here and I put my positive down
inside<00:01:54.060> where<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> clip<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.530> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
inside where you see the clip is and I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
inside where you see the clip is and I
got<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:55.950> wife<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.430> turn<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> key<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:58.020> she

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
got my wife to turn the key when she

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.450 
got my wife to turn the key when she
turned<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> key<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.770> no<00:01:58.860> power<00:01:59.100> there

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
turned the key there was no power there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.170 
turned the key there was no power there
so<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.850> meant

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
so that meant

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.410 
so that meant
oh<00:02:00.240> no<00:02:00.990> power<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> starter<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> tells

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
oh no power to the starter so that tells

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
oh no power to the starter so that tells
me<00:02:03.570> gosh<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.380> not<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.530> starter<00:02:04.890> issue<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.340> I'm

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
me gosh it's not a starter issue so I'm

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.830 
me gosh it's not a starter issue so I'm
not<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> waste<00:02:05.939> money<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.390> starter

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
not going to waste money on a starter

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.050 
not going to waste money on a starter
either<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.560> then<00:02:07.979> started<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.849> try<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
either and then started to try and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.540 
either and then started to try and
figure<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.229> fortunately<00:02:10.860> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
figure out what it was I fortunately it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.900 
figure out what it was I fortunately it
was<00:02:11.640> a

by the way not in sectional and idea

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
by the way not in sectional and idea
what<00:02:17.220> was<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.420> knew<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:18.870> was<00:02:18.990> power

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
what was that I knew there was power

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.990 
what was that I knew there was power
coming<00:02:19.680> from<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.100> ignition<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.640> he<00:02:20.760> said

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
coming from the ignition and he said

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.430 
coming from the ignition and he said
there's<00:02:21.240> an<00:02:21.330> issue<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.630> these<00:02:21.870> where<00:02:22.230> the

ignition in order to feed the starter
relay<00:02:34.290> or<00:02:34.620> anything<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.150> did<00:02:36.360> first

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
relay or anything so what I did first

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.390 
relay or anything so what I did first
was<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.990> pushed<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.440> put<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.740> push<00:02:37.950> button<00:02:37.980> in

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
was I pushed I put this push button in

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.630 
was I pushed I put this push button in
and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.390> tried<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.630> jump<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and I just tried to jump it right to the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.520 
and I just tried to jump it right to the
starter<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.240> actually<00:02:42.480> had<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.870> long<00:02:43.140> wire

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
starter so I actually had this long wire

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.080 
starter so I actually had this long wire
which<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.220> piece<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.400> wire<00:02:44.610> off<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
which is just a piece of wire off of a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.200 
which is just a piece of wire off of a
trailer<00:02:45.450> hitch<00:02:45.630> assembly<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.700> wired<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
trailer hitch assembly and I wired it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.830 
trailer hitch assembly and I wired it
directly<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.960> 12-volt<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.430> ran<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
directly to 12-volt and I ran the the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.220 
directly to 12-volt and I ran the the
other<00:02:51.990> wire<00:02:53.030> right<00:02:54.030> down<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.720> starter<00:02:55.080> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
other wire right down to the starter and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.740 
other wire right down to the starter and
I<00:02:55.560> plugged<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.240> actually<00:02:57.240> what<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> did<00:02:57.570> was

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
I plugged it in actually what I did was

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.950 
I plugged it in actually what I did was
I<00:02:57.840> pulled<00:02:58.020> out<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.320> worn<00:02:58.560> relay<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.490> I<00:03:00.450> put

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
I pulled out this worn relay and I put

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.350 
I pulled out this worn relay and I put
12<00:03:01.170> volts<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.980> put<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:02.640> side<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
12 volts on I put the one side on the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.290 
12 volts on I put the one side on the
12-volt<00:03:04.110> power<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.890> horn<00:03:05.100> relay<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
12-volt power on the horn relay and I

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.150 
12-volt power on the horn relay and I
ran<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.630> other<00:03:06.750> side<00:03:07.050> right<00:03:07.440> down<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:08.070> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
ran the other side right down to the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.830 
ran the other side right down to the
yellow<00:03:08.310> wire<00:03:08.640> down<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.390> said<00:03:09.570> look

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
yellow wire down there and I said look

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.390 
yellow wire down there and I said look
I'm<00:03:10.020> going<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.320> able<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.590> get<00:03:10.800> power<00:03:11.040> right

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
I'm going to be able to get power right

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.420 
I'm going to be able to get power right
to<00:03:11.580> my<00:03:11.790> starter<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.720> way<00:03:12.930> well<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.040> got<00:03:14.190> power

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
to my starter that way well it got power

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070 
to my starter that way well it got power
to<00:03:14.580> my<00:03:14.610> starter<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.570> thing<00:03:15.750> would<00:03:15.900> roll

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
to my starter and the thing would roll

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.310 
to my starter and the thing would roll
over<00:03:16.110> forever<00:03:16.740> but<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.670> never<00:03:17.880> would<00:03:18.120> start<00:03:18.420> so

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
over forever but it never would start so

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.960 
over forever but it never would start so
that<00:03:19.470> told<00:03:19.680> me<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.520> little<00:03:20.790> wire

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that told me that that little wire

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.330 
that told me that that little wire
coming<00:03:21.270> off<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.660> ignition<00:03:21.840> power<00:03:22.770> something

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
coming off the ignition power something

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340 
coming off the ignition power something
else<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.820> still<00:03:24.330> don't<00:03:24.510> know<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.230> got

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
else I still don't know what it is I got

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.890 
else I still don't know what it is I got
to<00:03:25.470> find<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.740> schematic<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.190> tell<00:03:26.430> me<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.810> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
to find a schematic to tell me but it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.190 
to find a schematic to tell me but it
powers<00:03:28.200> something<00:03:28.590> else<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:29.780> doesn't<00:03:30.780> allow

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
powers something else that doesn't allow

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.990 
powers something else that doesn't allow
the<00:03:31.260> vehicle<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.830> start<00:03:32.160> unless<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.580> power<00:03:32.730> is

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
the vehicle to start unless the power is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.550 
the vehicle to start unless the power is
coming<00:03:33.209> from<00:03:33.450> here<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.020> goes<00:03:34.200> into<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
coming from here and goes into the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.300 
coming from here and goes into the
relays<00:03:34.980> first<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.800> start<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.160> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
relays first so this is the start of a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.920 
relays first so this is the start of a
have<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.790> take<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.060> little<00:03:39.300> clip<00:03:39.480> off<00:03:39.660> what

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
have to take this little clip off what

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.590 
have to take this little clip off what
we<00:03:40.050> did<00:03:40.230> was<00:03:40.470> found<00:03:41.160> out<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.400> because<00:03:42.330> what

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
we did was found out that because what

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.720 
we did was found out that because what
my<00:03:42.750> biggest<00:03:43.080> issue<00:03:43.230> was<00:03:43.590> is<00:03:44.100> figuring<00:03:44.610> out

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
my biggest issue was is figuring out

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.400 
my biggest issue was is figuring out
which<00:03:44.940> wire<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> one<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:45.900> needed

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
which wire is the one that I needed

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.560 
which wire is the one that I needed
I<00:03:46.440> bought<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> Haynes<00:03:47.550> manual<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.270> didn't

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
I bought a Haynes manual that didn't

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.090 
I bought a Haynes manual that didn't
help<00:03:48.660> me<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.989> wire<00:03:49.140> colors<00:03:49.560> are<00:03:49.770> too<00:03:49.890> generic

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
help me the wire colors are too generic

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.810 
help me the wire colors are too generic
from<00:03:50.700> 19<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.570> think<00:03:52.320> 97<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.010> current<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.670> I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
from 19 I think 97 the current and I

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.280 
from 19 I think 97 the current and I
think<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.150> told<00:03:54.360> me<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.630> had<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.870> be<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.020> yellow

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
think it told me it had to be a yellow

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.590 
think it told me it had to be a yellow
wire<00:03:55.560> or<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:55.890> brown<00:03:56.640> wire<00:03:56.880> can't<00:03:57.180> remember<00:03:57.390> now

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
wire or a brown wire can't remember now

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.210 
wire or a brown wire can't remember now
but<00:03:57.630> there<00:03:58.290> weren't<00:03:58.530> any<00:03:58.709> here<00:03:59.040> they're

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
but there weren't any here they're

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.920 
but there weren't any here they're
mostly<00:03:59.430> pancan<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.090> hots<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:02.250> then<00:04:02.810> got<00:04:03.810> my

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
mostly pancan and hots so then got my

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.540 
mostly pancan and hots so then got my
brother<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.380> see<00:04:04.560> if<00:04:04.680> he<00:04:04.800> knew<00:04:05.100> anything<00:04:05.310> about

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
brother to see if he knew anything about

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.850 
brother to see if he knew anything about
the<00:04:06.209> wiring<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.959> seeing<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.770> the

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
the wiring and seeing if I was on the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.170 
the wiring and seeing if I was on the
right<00:04:07.980> track<00:04:08.040> couldn't<00:04:08.520> understand<00:04:08.910> why<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
right track couldn't understand why the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.970 
right track couldn't understand why the
vehicle<00:04:09.690> would<00:04:09.780> bumper<00:04:10.140> start<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:10.770> you<00:04:10.860> could

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
vehicle would bumper start so you could

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.140 
vehicle would bumper start so you could
roll<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.190> day<00:04:11.280> on<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.459> driveway<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.030> would

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
roll the day on the driveway and I would

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.860 
roll the day on the driveway and I would
start<00:04:12.770> but<00:04:13.770> yet<00:04:13.980> what<00:04:14.160> am<00:04:14.220> i<00:04:14.310> hot-wired<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.910> it

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
start but yet what am i hot-wired it it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.270 
start but yet what am i hot-wired it it
wouldn't<00:04:16.140> start<00:04:16.320> didn't<00:04:16.709> make<00:04:16.830> sense<00:04:16.980> to<00:04:17.190> us

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
wouldn't start didn't make sense to us

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.580 
wouldn't start didn't make sense to us
because<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.450> said<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.080> it<00:04:19.169> had<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
because it said that it had all the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.610 
because it said that it had all the
power<00:04:19.739> but<00:04:20.340> obviously<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.239> didn't<00:04:21.479> so<00:04:22.109> my

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
power but obviously it didn't so my

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.830 
power but obviously it didn't so my
little<00:04:22.770> nephew<00:04:23.160> hauled<00:04:23.880> up<00:04:24.060> Google

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
little nephew hauled up Google

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.939 
little nephew hauled up Google
not<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.590> good<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:26.150> internet<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.650> he<00:04:28.770> brought

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
not that good on internet so he brought

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.240 
not that good on internet so he brought
it<00:04:29.070> up<00:04:29.190> for<00:04:29.400> me<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.720> he<00:04:30.720> said<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:32.070> know<00:04:32.160> we

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
it up for me and he said you know we

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.439 
it up for me and he said you know we
took<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.430> look<00:04:32.610> at<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.760> drawing<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.300> was

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
took a look at the drawing and it was

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.370 
took a look at the drawing and it was
this<00:04:33.600> pink<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.250> orange<00:04:35.250> cable<00:04:36.210> our<00:04:36.780> wire<00:04:37.139> in

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
this pink and orange cable our wire in

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.460 
this pink and orange cable our wire in
there<00:04:37.590> that's<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.340> one<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.699> actually<00:04:39.470> fires

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
there that's the one that actually fires

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.800 
there that's the one that actually fires
up<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.860> starter<00:04:41.400> coil<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:41.940> started<00:04:42.540> relay

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
up the starter coil and started relay

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.990 
up the starter coil and started relay
and<00:04:43.020> everything<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:43.590> we<00:04:43.710> needed<00:04:43.889> to<00:04:44.160> find<00:04:44.760> out

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
and everything so we needed to find out

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.350 
and everything so we needed to find out
and<00:04:45.210> you'll<00:04:45.750> see<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.050> subsequent<00:04:46.320> videos<00:04:47.360> what

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
and you'll see in subsequent videos what

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.190 
and you'll see in subsequent videos what
we've<00:04:48.510> done<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.199> try<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.380> wire<00:04:49.710> into<00:04:50.010> that
