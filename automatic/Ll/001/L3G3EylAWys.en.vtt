00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hey, guys, what am I on this video? 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.460
 From here I'll teach you how 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.230
 got the last one makes tef that's like 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 was the pickup version before the closing 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 of this improved version of it wins turkey 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 with this you will need to have to do 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.550
 this is obviously the channel of fire to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.020
 those who can not make it back in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.580
 link from the subscription returned here one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.449
 video teaching how to build your 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.920
 staff 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.420
 When you build it you have 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.580
 which I imported crisis play quoted the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 red portal entered with this place ' 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.510
 and you lose in that area where you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 main river red portal or those 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.989
 four boxes there as a symbol 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 strange and what you have to do 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.399
 sacrifice will sum up and petkovic kill 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 I do not know how many names is around 30 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.520
 for each of these boxes there may be 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.590
 pass on that kitty 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 when the truth and she then she will 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.030
 Light the fire and go to another little box. 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 when already completed three four 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.690
 the fire will erase and you will 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 see this goal is something if you 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 playing alone is not cheap comes out 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.780
 out there but you play but not 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.559
 much more than two other people 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.059
 people 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.129
 I recommend everyone stays in the skirt. 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.719
 hence it is introduced which will come to 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.240
 Go and you will not have to wait so long 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.650
 wheels as they drink their share of the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.180
 means for you if you have a friend 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.799
 your team somewhere else to balance 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.049
 a bit late for each person 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.210
 so I like how you do this whole step 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.189
 world still the example in itself well 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.350
 next step is the part of the codes that 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.729
 remain in the church and at least one 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 complicated week will only come back to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.299
 You play really easy and simple for you. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 has no difficulty at all 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.530
 well, it's very easy said to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.270
 true after you know it is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.799
 leaving a code and with a certainty that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.310
 all you have to do is give a gift in the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.500
 screen 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 Just before I get there because I say 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 for you when you stick it and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.799
 you have the second click option 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.630
 hold the button you will take 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.100
 carrying a more powerful shot I do not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 I recorded it doing it because at the time I 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.189
 Had I taped this I did not know 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.380
 I was not going to do that, I'm going to say to 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.149
 you here this tip as well as you can 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.680
 see the wall has two codes in that 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.540
 only one of them is lit 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.610
 on the wall next to them will have three 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.899
 codes action of the half is on and not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.140
 right yesterday that the two tables 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.189
 two players will give certainties well 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.229
 In this photo I'm going to show you 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.060
 now they are all going to make a toast that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.459
 I'm showing which number of each 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.020
 of each of these codes of education 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.940
 dick was on the computer and even 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.920
 courage for entrepreneurs whenever 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.840
 You want to make the team does the IMF. 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.420
 about this video here again to see the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.700
 code and when 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.280
 as long as you have deciphered what each 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.349
 of these numbers on the wall board and the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.790
 What do you have to do with this church there? 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.020
 They will have their torches. 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 You have to light each one of these. 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.670
 shops giving shot as it was up to queues and 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.950
 still when he will follow the four 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.239
 you four numbers always you go 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.739
 to see that she said something and 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.910
 all stories will defend 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.209
 there you are ready for the next 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.130
 step the next step is very similar to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.930
 which is practically identical 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.090
 virtually identical to all other 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.620
 to all married course have to do 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.060
 now is to go out here and punch triggered the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 lever the buttons stay with color 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.340
 that with this idea of fire the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 red color and yellow etf today touch the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.600
 face and blue ice 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.910
 It just starts there talking about fire. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.790
 now it's going to be red and I wanted to talk 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.290
 for you to do from there I have 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.000
 I tell you what you can 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.950
 when they already have the last 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.090
 was boss can click and security on 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.260
 world will not be consumed by loading a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.060
 more powerful shot 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.739
 I did not record it, I did not record it. 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.489
 not powerful shot because I did not know 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.440
 do 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.420
 I did not know how to do this at the time. 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.120
 now I know and also for those who do not have 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.560
 so much did the one punch 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.720
 if you when you are with the team do 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.310
 Test you're stabbed with envy 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.470
 Are you going to use the same staff? 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.090
 blade for stabbing and one 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.920
 power that I do not think is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.870
 more powerful than the difficult test 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.709
 since you do not stay 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.850
 continuing to benefit and does not use the staff 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.200
 and when it will end the levers 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.090
 red oil you have to do 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.130
 will be on the red ball that will be 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.840
 below and they will generate a little 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.980
 you the next step 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.049
 You have to do now is the last. 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.290
 sacrifice of an animal without putting the 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.450
 there in this place where you 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.370
 picked pebbles and made the 25 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.859
 clubs too, but less so close to 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.420
 you get the fastest the default is on 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.160
 Last video was the wind channel I said 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.230
 to explain to you how you can achieve 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.459
 use the fire channel to get the job 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.260
 should I punch you? 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.180
 When you are already with the last etf 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.380
 you have the option to put it in place 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.720
 Where did you leave to make the sacrifice? 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.820
 one more time only you do not need 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.440
 make no sacrifice you do not have 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.030
 obligation to put it back 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.470
 whenever you change your staff 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.050
 worry about something else 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.000
 the staff is going back there for you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.750
 like it catches the foot champions but you 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.080
 has the option of color 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.060
 to him and there in the coldplay if 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.620
 when you are doing the staff version 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.970
 for it when you arrive in the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.350
 sacrifice of the married 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.570
 there you can pick up the other one loaded by you 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.710
 already has the ultimate version of it and you 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.290
 sacrifice for more 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.610
 easily cane is needed here only 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.200
 I hope it's not decided here if 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.580
 you liked do not forget to leave me 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.500
 here a comment saying that we are 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.700
 Seeing here that helps me a lot and I stay 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.310
 very happy to know what you found 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.700
 Iraq including here I just went to the 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.700
 next
