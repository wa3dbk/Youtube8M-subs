00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:31.470
 os good luck good guys business over there 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.060
 performed from the inside 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.060
 from inside to outside 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.230
 The main mistakes of many in this and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.550
 not well mask a blow 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.390
 perform it immediately in front of the opponent but 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.629
 you do not enter boku ss to get hit 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 visible and easily blocked in order 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:08.700
 to get fired replacements needed 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.700
 may try to display more on the side 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.229
 wrong do you can see that blow 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:33.420
 noticeably a man will immediately raise his hands and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:36.420
 block one more strike 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.420
 perform 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.080
 we also need to pay attention 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.240
 here is mandatory during 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:03.400
 pivot foot turns 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:09.310
 how do you perform longitudinal splits 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.310
 stop moment of impact hook turn 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.020
 in order to learn how to beat dramatically there 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.400
 another moment 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:44.100
 sock when you let go of the leg you need 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.570
 slightly fall down due to this 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:53.190
 movement kick will be even more 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:59.280
 in fact the shock surface is 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:03.870
 card again if you are earning 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.080
 First you can get to the farther 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.940
 distances and accordingly increase 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.940
 the speed he runs 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.430
 yes equal through thing too through 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.270
 overcharge 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:12.320
 if the option you put is acceptable 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:16.880
 barrel or troechku and you get it once 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:31.600
 two and on the last beat leg rests 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:31.600
 back maybe here early 2 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.830
 movement looks something like seen on 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.520
 done with beating leg put back 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:22.000
 back here I will immediately do another 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:22.000
 can prepare there through science 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:34.659
 the person attaches and already you jump 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:40.370
 legs are about 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:44.979
 a few beats sounds and then apply 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.979
 you have a window there teaches
