some some thoughts certainly that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
some some thoughts certainly that
they're<00:00:48.600> getting<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:49.050> close<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> ultimately

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
they're getting very close to ultimately

a rescue plan for Greece certainly

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430

austerity<00:00:54.420> measures<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.170> having

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
austerity measures that will be having

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
austerity measures that will be having
to<00:00:55.500> take<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.920> by<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> Greek<00:00:56.460> government<00:00:56.670> do

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to take it on by the Greek government do

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.689 
to take it on by the Greek government do
you<00:00:57.420> believe<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.930> will<00:00:58.079> ultimately<00:00:58.199> work<00:01:01.699> well

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you believe it will ultimately work well

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.080 
you believe it will ultimately work well
I<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.570> bailed<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.170> by

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
I think that will be with bailed out by

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
I think that will be with bailed out by
indirectly<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:07.260> ECB<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.670> guarantee

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
indirectly the ECB that will guarantee

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.840 
indirectly the ECB that will guarantee
some<00:01:09.689> bonds<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:10.890> issuing<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
some bonds that they are issuing and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.700 
some bonds that they are issuing and
these<00:01:12.060> bombs<00:01:12.420> will<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:13.049> bought<00:01:13.290> by<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
these bombs will then be bought by the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.640 
these bombs will then be bought by the
public<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.460> by<00:01:14.640> financial<00:01:15.210> institutions<00:01:15.650> but

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
public or by financial institutions but

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
public or by financial institutions but
I<00:01:16.710> don't<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.640> work<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.630> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
I don't think it will work out and I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.100 
I don't think it will work out and I
think<00:01:19.080> other<00:01:19.320> countries<00:01:19.920> like<00:01:20.130> Spain<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
think other countries like Spain and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.370 
think other countries like Spain and
probably<00:01:23.150> Portugal<00:01:24.150> will<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.600> also<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
probably Portugal will then also have to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
probably Portugal will then also have to
be<00:01:25.530> bailed<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:26.009> eventually<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.720> will

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
be bailed out eventually and it will

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.590 
be bailed out eventually and it will
lead<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.680> monetization<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.939> Europe<00:01:30.270> one

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
lead to more monetization in Europe one

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.130 
lead to more monetization in Europe one
of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> reasons<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.680> euro<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.070> beens<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.729> week

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
of the reasons the euro has beens a week

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
of the reasons the euro has beens a week
why<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.439> believe<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.100> won't<00:01:35.310> work<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
why do you believe that it won't work in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
why do you believe that it won't work in
Greece<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> ultimately<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> Spain<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
Greece and ultimately that Spain and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
Greece and ultimately that Spain and
Portugal<00:01:37.470> will<00:01:37.920> suffer<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> similar<00:01:38.549> fate<00:01:40.310> well

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
Portugal will suffer a similar fate well

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.050 
Portugal will suffer a similar fate well
I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.880> pain<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.439> austerity<00:01:44.220> will

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
I think the pain of the austerity will

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.780 
I think the pain of the austerity will
be<00:01:45.299> very<00:01:46.079> very<00:01:46.200> burdensome<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.549> Greece<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
be very very burdensome on Greece and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.859 
be very very burdensome on Greece and
eventually<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> economy<00:01:53.189> cannot<00:01:53.640> grow<00:01:54.090> with

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
eventually the economy cannot grow with

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.219 
eventually the economy cannot grow with
the<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.250> budget<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the kind of budget they will have to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.459 
the kind of budget they will have to
enact<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.890> under<00:01:59.880> these<00:02:00.090> conditions<00:02:00.469> their

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
enact and under these conditions their

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.010 
enact and under these conditions their
currency<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.640> overvalued<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.689> me<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
currency is way overvalued they me the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.359 
currency is way overvalued they me the
euro<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.899> without<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.500> ability<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.129> grow

euro and so without the ability to grow

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
euro and so without the ability to grow
their<00:02:08.759> ability<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.509> actually<00:02:09.629> pay<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
their ability to actually pay the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050 
their ability to actually pay the
interest<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.709> repay<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.099> debts

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
interest and repay the debts

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.750 
interest and repay the debts
we'll<00:02:12.300> actually<00:02:12.510> diminish<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.730> a

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
we'll actually diminish this is a

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610 
we'll actually diminish this is a
long-term<00:02:15.450> issue<00:02:15.750> though<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.440> not

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
long-term issue though is it not

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.199 
long-term issue though is it not
something<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.220> will<00:02:17.340> play<00:02:17.550> out<00:02:17.580> over<00:02:17.760> years

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
something that will play out over years

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.449 
something that will play out over years
yes<00:02:21.209> over<00:02:21.660> years<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.160> what<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
yes over years and you know what it

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.449 
yes over years and you know what it
basically<00:02:23.670> means<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.280> governments<00:02:26.280> like

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
basically means is that governments like

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.670 
basically means is that governments like
the<00:02:26.640> federal<00:02:27.060> government<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.080> US<00:02:28.410> will

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the federal government in the US will

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.559 
the federal government in the US will
have<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.040> bail<00:02:29.310> out<00:02:29.519> some<00:02:29.940> states<00:02:30.330> like

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
have to bail out some states like

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.170 
have to bail out some states like
Illinois<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.709> California<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.849> Europe

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
Illinois and California and in Europe

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.470 
Illinois and California and in Europe
they<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.750> bail<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.230> weaker<00:02:35.040> countries

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
they have to bail out weaker countries

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.430 
they have to bail out weaker countries
like<00:02:36.480> Greece<00:02:37.519> Portugal<00:02:38.519> Spain<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.750> probably

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
like Greece Portugal Spain and probably

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.840 
like Greece Portugal Spain and probably
eventually<00:02:40.650> also<00:02:41.130> Italy<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.530> means

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
eventually also Italy and so it means

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.670 
eventually also Italy and so it means
monetization<00:02:44.850> which<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.450> not<00:02:45.660> all<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.959> bad

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
monetization which is not all that bad

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.130 
monetization which is not all that bad
for<00:02:47.130> equities<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.540> course<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:49.049> not

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
for equities but of course it's not

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.039 
for equities but of course it's not
favorable<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.130> bonds<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.120> government<00:02:51.630> bonds

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
favorable for bonds for government bonds

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.740

the monetization snc of the date and
that<00:07:15.920> will<00:07:16.190> lead<00:07:16.400> to<00:07:16.430> a<00:07:16.580> weak<00:07:16.880> dollar<00:07:17.210> and
