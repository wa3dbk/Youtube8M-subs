 to install a printer and there you 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.640
 enter the installation wizard 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.710

 choose your type of support then for 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.350
 the photo often you will take

 photo paper here glossy photo paper 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.009
 for example 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.539
 in fact it's your resolution rather 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.429
 hot for portrait photo printing 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:59.950
 landscape the size what wanted to do 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:02.200
 of the format see photo format 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.780
 classics the hall and all 9 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.590
 he knows all this and then of course the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.860
 a4 the bessin nail to five all these 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.500
 formats there usually we do a lot of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.480
 to 4 and then if you have it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 possibility it's important for a 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.910
 photo print without borders 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.930
 so be careful they often they they 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.900
 you specify that it is only 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.989
 valid for some papers so the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.560
 pressure on board so the whole picture 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.739
 it's very important for photos 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.299
 this is another quality for you after 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.849
 had everywhere but you are not 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:48.819
 obliged to enter all the menus 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:51.100
 hockey done next there you go 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.970
 define what you want to print 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.370
 then sent oneself is to copy them 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.090
 in quotation marks it's photo mode 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.880
 see there there are the rest of the edges 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.810
 while the up 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.299
 do not put the edge so it's rather 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.709
 full page photo 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.329
 or you can have lots of pictures 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.849
 if this is the case you have selected 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.700
 many more Tetouan images there is 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.239
 with edges two or three in 2 or 3 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.930
 per child 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.730
 9 May 13 to have everything you 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.590
 want 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.620
 so earlier we defined the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.010
 paper size is here now we 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 sets the size of the print on a 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.970
 sheet of paper 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.769
 so me as I took several of 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.360
 like excuse me I took only one 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.690
 picture but I took a sheet of 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.549
 A4 paper on a sheet of A4 paper 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.819
 I can implement thirteen sailboats 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.909
 the equivalent of four photos agree 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.640
 and then of course you can say 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:59.019
 how many times is it used here 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:01.090
 every image here and there it's gone 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.590
 and you throw it you see it's not 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.310
 very complicated by cons what is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.170
 Very important 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.760
 oh yes so here I must I 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.250
 give my bac that's the thing 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.840
 classic the but what is important 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.700
 it is to effectively follow the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.120
 procedure as usual to read well 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:21.340
 what is marked and take a 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:26.110
 correct printer with paper 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.030
 Photo quality and with inks often 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.740
 it works better for people 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.110
 inkjet printers do not forget 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.550
 than a photo printer if you want 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.770
 have no problem with you 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.930
 do not want them to clog it 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.870
 must use it 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.460
 would not it be a small photo 1 a 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.740
 once every 15 days minimum 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.010
 Here thank you soon at 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.010
