00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 good afternoon dear friends and with you 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.910
 perpetuum mobile 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.770
 or Alexander today I want you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.469
 demonstrate a mod that will allow 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.440
 you will be in the shoes of this Kratos 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.799
 god of war from the game god of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 war 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.000
 why I gave this game as an example 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.039
 yes because she is as bloody as 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.109
 and will be a marker minecraft, when you 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.000
 put this mod maybe you 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.160
 faced such a problem that fights with 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 monsters and zombie skeletons are not 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.349
 quite epic bloody spectacular 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.290
 this mod will literally change everything now 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.350
 the battles will be interesting bright and bloody 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.899
 it allows you to dismember monsters that is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.399
 when you hit a cute zombie on the head with a sword 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.590
 will fly let me demonstrate 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.660
 it is me who blows a blow . 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.850
 so she flew off now I can even her 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 kick just like in some kind of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.860
 on steel from it will flow blood at 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.020
 blow and the game becomes more beautiful well 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.579
 of course blood doesn't always make games 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.010
 beautiful but nonetheless 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.930
 blood of course a little bit weak pixel 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 but this is minecraft everything should be 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.390
 pixel and square can also 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.850
 solve zombie hands when struck you see 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.680
 hand flew off then heads to the zombies all 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.250
 still alive like a real zombie as befits 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 zombie 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 because when a zombie dies from him 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.729
 the whole body remains this even somehow not 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 looks ethical because zombies need 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.310
 extend let's take an example now 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.009
 with wheel skeletons i mean i can too 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.170
 to hit the hidden head he will fly off in 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.030
 In this case, two hands flew off at one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.100
 and the second one now has a skeleton 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.110
 shoot at you servant and he becomes 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 harmless, you can safely carry him 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.869
 head off something like this again, 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.149
 head you can kick the author claims 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.310
 that it is possible to expand not only skeletons and 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.290
 zombies but also a pig but a step to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.399
 Sorry I checked and the pigs didn't 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.770
 dismembered 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.110
 maybe it's because of the curvature of my arms, but 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.659
 I do not dismember them zombies 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 perfectly dissected that is guys 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.340
 Now you can make the game more 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.579
 beautiful for someone beautiful bright and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.530
 spectacular thanks for watching
