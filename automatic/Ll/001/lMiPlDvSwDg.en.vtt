00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.510
 load you back load yourself 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.670
 let's hope it loads to start but 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.570
 with the beginning says 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.250
 Hello, if you have not formalized yet 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.210
 the basics of the game you can start 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.210
 a game 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.540
 in the field of people performing the 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.820
 brief tour no threats to see 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.320
 different 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.210
 very pretty just young 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.140
 up to the pasture 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.140
 the land but it 's a I have I have 10 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.460
 but my question about being able to upload that chip 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.460
 diverse 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.960
 nothing 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.600
 of voest 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.600
 no no, none of that a delight 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.130
 they are only deluxe in fart 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.130
 so 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.500
 then show my lamp 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.500
 so 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.870
 this is the lamp 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.379
 the terrain of the tractors 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.250
 will be on the other side I think 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.390
 even the steps listen well to the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.390
 falls off 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.549
 listen to different friends because I have 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.549
 a flu 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.020
 a struggle but open to today 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.530
 And I like 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.530
 in sight but 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.470
 how many workers have 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.430
 do not 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.430
 where they click 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.209
 can be 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.840
 also worker 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.840
 to all the arts 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.850
 question to the one who was performing 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.850
 garage 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.500
 good that kid 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.390
 I do not work the world that paisa 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.830
 accelerates the driver 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.830
 knowing the ranch you know 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.280
 grabbing shortcuts too 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.000
 now this flight is going to serve me yet 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.410
 the year cause 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.340
 those with this 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:10.709
 but I'll tell you 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.709
 we have to give reason to this 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.270
 it's playing 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.350
 reverse 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.250
 Of course 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.819
 work the cutter 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.389
 as it is 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.549
 it is not cut 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:52.180
 we'll see 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.180
 more functions or turn on the counter 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.950
 I know everything 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.840
 as the change of state 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.840
 what is is more than more than 5 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.889
 xbox is weird 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.439
 but we can is so fast 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:23.119
