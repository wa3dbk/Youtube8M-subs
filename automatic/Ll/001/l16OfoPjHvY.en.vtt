plants<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.609> really<00:00:05.819> taken<00:00:05.940> off<00:00:06.180> here<00:00:06.299> in<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
plants have really taken off here in the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.290 
plants have really taken off here in the
last<00:00:06.600> few<00:00:06.810> weeks<00:00:07.250> we<00:00:08.250> planted<00:00:08.639> them<00:00:08.760> by<00:00:08.940> seed

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
last few weeks we planted them by seed

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.249 
last few weeks we planted them by seed
about<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.290> month<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.679> half<00:00:10.710> ago<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.719> we<00:00:12.719> do

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
about a month and a half ago and we do

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.690 
about a month and a half ago and we do
them<00:00:13.440> direct<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.340> ground<00:00:14.490> no

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
them direct so right in the ground no

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.000 
them direct so right in the ground no
transplanting<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.619> they've<00:00:16.619> done<00:00:16.830> really

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
transplanting and they've done really

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.150 
transplanting and they've done really
well<00:00:17.190> for<00:00:17.250> us<00:00:17.460> we've<00:00:17.880> already<00:00:18.060> picked<00:00:18.359> about

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
well for us we've already picked about

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.980 
well for us we've already picked about
30<00:00:20.160> zucchini<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.390> we're<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> show

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
30 zucchini and so we're going to show

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.710 
30 zucchini and so we're going to show
you<00:00:22.050> how<00:00:22.519> how<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> harvest<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> Keaney<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.480> so

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you how how to harvest is Keaney here so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.470 
you how how to harvest is Keaney here so
this<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.920> an<00:00:26.099> ideal<00:00:26.250> size<00:00:26.789> where<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
this is really an ideal size where you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
this is really an ideal size where you
want<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> pick<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.019> much<00:00:28.920> larger<00:00:29.429> than<00:00:29.640> this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
want to pick them much larger than this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.460 
want to pick them much larger than this
and<00:00:30.150> they'll<00:00:30.269> start<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.570> develop<00:00:30.720> seeds<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and they'll start to develop seeds and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.530 
and they'll start to develop seeds and
it<00:00:31.800> becomes<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:32.940> tricky<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> cook

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
it becomes a little more tricky to cook

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
it becomes a little more tricky to cook
them<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> harvest<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.130> around<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
them we like to harvest them around this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
them we like to harvest them around this
size<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.300> grow<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.500> stir-fry

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
size that we can grow them or stir-fry

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.639 
size that we can grow them or stir-fry
them<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:40.020> harvest<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
them so don't harvest them you want to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.049 
them so don't harvest them you want to
grab<00:00:40.800> near<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> top<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> zucchini<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
grab near the top of the zucchini and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
grab near the top of the zucchini and
just<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> twist<00:00:43.460> typically<00:00:44.460> they'll

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
just kind of twist typically they'll

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.920 
just kind of twist typically they'll
break<00:00:44.850> off<00:00:45.500> without<00:00:46.500> too<00:00:46.860> much<00:00:46.980> trouble

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
break off without too much trouble

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.160 
break off without too much trouble
got<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> few<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> want<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.800> pick<00:00:51.170> see

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
we have a bunch of flowers that will

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.900 
we have a bunch of flowers that will
eventually<00:00:53.879> become<00:00:54.829> more<00:00:55.829> zucchini<00:00:56.190> here's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
eventually become more zucchini here's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.380 
eventually become more zucchini here's
another<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.680> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.390> grabbing

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
another one and just kind of grabbing

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.490 
another one and just kind of grabbing
twist<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.190> they<00:01:02.190> tend<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> always<00:01:02.760> break<00:01:02.969> off

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
twist and they tend to always break off

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.310 
twist and they tend to always break off
just<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.510> just<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.750> wanted<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> show

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
this one back here you see it's kind of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.850 
this one back here you see it's kind of
hiding<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.360> got<00:01:12.479> pretty<00:01:12.990> large<00:01:13.260> we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
hiding but this one got pretty large we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.010 
hiding but this one got pretty large we
checked<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.820> harvested<00:01:15.210> these<00:01:15.360> two<00:01:15.689> days<00:01:15.869> ago

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
checked we harvested these two days ago

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
checked we harvested these two days ago
and<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.130> ready<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> can

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and this one was not ready so you can

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
and this one was not ready so you can
see<00:01:18.030> how<00:01:18.119> much<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.450> grows<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.110> few<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
see how much it grows in just a few a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.219 
see how much it grows in just a few a
few<00:01:20.970> days<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.040> nothing<00:01:23.040> wrong<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.520> one

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
few days and nothing wrong with this one

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.550 
few days and nothing wrong with this one
but<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.990> quite<00:01:27.990> large<00:01:28.200> we'll

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
but you can see it is quite large we'll

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.749 
but you can see it is quite large we'll
have<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> make<00:01:28.920> zucchini<00:01:29.189> bread<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.579> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
have to make zucchini bread out of this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.260 
have to make zucchini bread out of this
or<00:01:29.939> something<00:01:31.579> there's<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.090> seeds

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
or something there's just a lot of seeds

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.530 
or something there's just a lot of seeds
in<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.720> us<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.990> try<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> grill<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.540> okay

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
in here for us to try to grill it okay

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.090 
in here for us to try to grill it okay
so<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> wanted<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> point<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so I wanted to point this one out it is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
so I wanted to point this one out it is
only<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.430> four<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:38.880> five<00:01:39.030> inches<00:01:39.299> long<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
only about four or five inches long and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.410 
only about four or five inches long and
about<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:39.990> inch<00:01:40.079> thick<00:01:40.220> but<00:01:41.220> it'll<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> be

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
about an inch thick but it'll need to be

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.920 
about an inch thick but it'll need to be
picked<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.840> probably<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> next<00:01:43.799> day<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.220> so

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
picked in probably the next day or so

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
picked in probably the next day or so
it'll<00:01:45.930> grow<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.829> seems<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.220> probably<00:01:47.399> 2<00:01:47.610> or

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it'll grow what seems like probably 2 or

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.630 
it'll grow what seems like probably 2 or
3<00:01:47.939> inches<00:01:48.240> overnight<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.590> crazy<00:01:50.189> how<00:01:50.369> quick

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
3 inches overnight it's crazy how quick

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.389 
3 inches overnight it's crazy how quick
do<00:01:50.820> Keeney<00:01:51.030> grows<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.649> 11<00:01:53.040> plants

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
do Keeney grows so if we have 11 plants
