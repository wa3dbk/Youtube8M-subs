00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
needle gauge and find the needle size

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.560 
needle gauge and find the needle size
that<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.800> used<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.250> find<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:34.090> crochet<00:04:34.539> hook

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that you used and find a crochet hook

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.560 
that you used and find a crochet hook
that<00:04:34.990> fits<00:04:35.199> in<00:04:35.350> that<00:04:35.380> same<00:04:35.710> hole<00:04:36.009> if<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.330> are

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
that fits in that same hole if you are

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.320 
that fits in that same hole if you are
using<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:38.410> lighter<00:04:39.220> weight<00:04:39.460> yarn<00:04:39.729> or<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.000> heavier

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
using a lighter weight yarn or a heavier

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.629 
using a lighter weight yarn or a heavier
weight<00:04:40.570> yarn<00:04:40.840> for<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.440> decorative<00:04:41.710> edge<00:04:42.009> then

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
weight yarn for the decorative edge then

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.040 
weight yarn for the decorative edge then
you're<00:04:42.849> going<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.180> need<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.570> change<00:04:43.780> up<00:04:43.990> your

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
you're going to need to change up your

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.050 
you're going to need to change up your
gauge<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.500> little<00:04:44.889> bit<00:04:45.070> but<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.550> easy<00:04:45.580> to

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
gauge a little bit but it's so easy to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.170 
gauge a little bit but it's so easy to
do<00:04:46.210> here<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:47.620> skipped<00:04:48.130> two<00:04:48.460> stitches<00:04:48.490> for<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
do here I skipped two stitches for the

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.420 
do here I skipped two stitches for the
double<00:04:49.509> crochet<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:50.470> might<00:04:50.680> find<00:04:50.949> that<00:04:51.250> with

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
double crochet you might find that with

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.980 
double crochet you might find that with
a<00:04:51.669> heavier<00:04:51.970> weight<00:04:52.150> yarn<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:52.539> you<00:04:52.720> need<00:04:52.900> to

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
a heavier weight yarn that you need to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.080 
a heavier weight yarn that you need to
skip<00:04:53.259> three<00:04:53.590> or<00:04:53.919> with<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.430> lighter<00:04:54.639> weight<00:04:54.849> yarn

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
skip three or with a lighter weight yarn

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.170 
skip three or with a lighter weight yarn
that<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.330> need<00:04:55.509> to<00:04:55.599> skip<00:04:55.840> one<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:57.250> easy<00:04:57.550> it's

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
that you need to skip one the easy it's

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.360 
that you need to skip one the easy it's
easy<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.509> figure<00:04:58.660> out<00:04:58.840> if<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.080> see<00:04:59.349> that<00:04:59.560> your

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
easy to figure out if you see that your

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.969 
easy to figure out if you see that your
your<00:05:01.240> fabric<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:01.900> stretching<00:05:02.259> a<00:05:02.530> little<00:05:02.770> bit

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
your fabric is stretching a little bit

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.040 
your fabric is stretching a little bit
you<00:05:03.580> need<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:03.849> include<00:05:04.120> some<00:05:04.449> more<00:05:04.479> stitches

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
you need to include some more stitches

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.430 
you need to include some more stitches
or<00:05:05.259> if<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:05.770> see<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.280> your<00:05:06.400> edge<00:05:06.580> is<00:05:07.000> kind<00:05:07.180> of

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
or if you see that your edge is kind of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.290 
or if you see that your edge is kind of
ruffling<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.620> little<00:05:08.889> bit<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:09.610> need<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:09.970> skip

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
ruffling a little bit you need to skip

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.450 
ruffling a little bit you need to skip
more<00:05:10.479> stitches<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.289> you<00:05:11.710> can<00:05:11.889> always<00:05:12.159> just

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
more stitches and you can always just

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.310 
more stitches and you can always just
work<00:05:12.760> up<00:05:12.909> a<00:05:13.000> little<00:05:13.240> bit<00:05:13.389> of<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:13.780> see<00:05:14.139> how

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
work up a little bit of it and see how

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.129 
work up a little bit of it and see how
it's<00:05:14.560> lying<00:05:15.370> if<00:05:15.610> it's<00:05:15.729> not<00:05:15.909> flat<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.870> can<00:05:16.990> just

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
it's lying if it's not flat you can just

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.230 
it's lying if it's not flat you can just
do<00:05:17.260> this<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.620> try<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> little<00:05:18.820> bit<00:05:18.909> more<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.150> it

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
do this and try a little bit more of it

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.420 
do this and try a little bit more of it
again<00:05:19.479> it's<00:05:19.870> that's<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.620> nice<00:05:20.800> about<00:05:21.070> crochet

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
again it's that's so nice about crochet

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.680 
again it's that's so nice about crochet
because<00:05:21.580> you're<00:05:21.729> just<00:05:21.849> left<00:05:22.030> with<00:05:22.120> one<00:05:22.449> loop

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
because you're just left with one loop

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.790 
because you're just left with one loop
to<00:05:22.840> pick<00:05:22.990> up<00:05:23.139> when<00:05:23.289> you're<00:05:23.409> done

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
to pick up when you're done

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800 
to pick up when you're done
the<00:05:24.729> other<00:05:24.849> thing<00:05:25.120> is<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.330> as<00:05:25.599> you're

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
the other thing is that as you're

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.540 
the other thing is that as you're
working<00:05:25.900> across<00:05:26.349> this<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:26.770> may<00:05:27.010> not<00:05:27.039> have<00:05:27.400> the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
working across this you may not have the

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.339 
working across this you may not have the
exact<00:05:27.940> number<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.270> stitches<00:05:28.570> you<00:05:28.810> need<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.229> get

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
exact number of stitches you need to get

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.640 
exact number of stitches you need to get
across<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.880> you<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.900> can<00:05:32.080> just<00:05:32.110> fudge<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.530> you

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
across so you just can just fudge it you

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.980 
across so you just can just fudge it you
figure<00:05:32.979> it<00:05:33.070> out<00:05:33.190> if<00:05:33.520> you<00:05:33.880> need<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.180> skip<00:05:34.810> an

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
figure it out if you need to skip an

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.370 
figure it out if you need to skip an
extra<00:05:35.320> one<00:05:35.500> or<00:05:36.150> skip<00:05:37.150> an<00:05:37.300> extra<00:05:37.570> few<00:05:37.870> over<00:05:38.349> the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
extra one or skip an extra few over the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.560 
extra one or skip an extra few over the
next<00:05:38.680> few<00:05:38.889> scallops<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:40.060> that<00:05:40.210> when<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.419> get

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
next few scallops so that when you get

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.659 
next few scallops so that when you get
to<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.780> edge<00:05:40.900> you'll<00:05:41.470> work<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:41.860> scallop<00:05:42.340> here

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
to the edge you'll work a scallop here

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.170 
to the edge you'll work a scallop here
in<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.060> edge<00:05:43.320> whoops<00:05:44.320> that's<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.710> wrong<00:05:44.860> side

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
in the edge whoops that's the wrong side

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.850 
in the edge whoops that's the wrong side
like<00:05:46.180> I<00:05:46.360> have<00:05:46.599> here<00:05:46.960> and<00:05:47.110> I<00:05:47.409> found<00:05:47.620> that

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
like I have here and I found that

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.260 
like I have here and I found that
working<00:05:48.340> eight<00:05:48.880> scallops<00:05:49.599> in<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.050> corner<00:05:50.440> is

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
working eight scallops in the corner is

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.870 
working eight scallops in the corner is
makes<00:05:52.270> for<00:05:52.539> a<00:05:52.570> nice<00:05:52.810> corner<00:05:53.259> turn<00:05:53.610> and<00:05:54.610> I<00:05:54.729> also

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
makes for a nice corner turn and I also

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.100 
makes for a nice corner turn and I also
want<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.120> show<00:05:55.270> you<00:05:55.330> how<00:05:55.479> this<00:05:55.630> looks<00:05:55.870> from<00:05:55.930> the

want to show you how this looks from the

want to show you how this looks from the
back<00:05:56.259> it's<00:05:56.620> also<00:05:56.830> pretty<00:05:57.099> from<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.430> back

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
back it's also pretty from the back

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.159 
back it's also pretty from the back
little<00:05:58.870> flatter<00:05:59.199> looking<00:05:59.590> but<00:05:59.710> still<00:05:59.949> pretty
