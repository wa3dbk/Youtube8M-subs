you're<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:35.910> multiplying<00:00:36.630> anything<00:00:37.110> well<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
you're not multiplying anything well you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.690 
you're not multiplying anything well you
didn't<00:00:37.739> let<00:00:37.860> me<00:00:37.950> finish

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
didn't let me finish

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.350 
didn't let me finish
why<00:00:39.180> don't<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.390> finish<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:41.059> well<00:00:42.059> i<00:00:42.090> buy<00:00:42.329> a

multiply<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.829> by<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.510> gallon<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> half

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
multiply that by the gallon and a half

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.189 
multiply that by the gallon and a half
of<00:00:46.170> milk<00:00:47.899> why<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.789> because

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
of milk why would you do that because

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
of milk why would you do that because
because<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.489> making<00:00:53.489> cheese<00:00:53.850> milk<00:00:55.640> go<00:00:56.640> get

okay here we go

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.180 
okay here we go
here<00:01:22.070> we<00:01:22.130> go<00:01:22.840> multiply<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.920> denominator<00:01:24.920> and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
here we go multiply the denominator and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.670 
here we go multiply the denominator and
the<00:01:25.430> whole<00:01:25.460> number<00:01:25.670> then<00:01:26.390> add<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.870> product<00:01:27.410> to

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
the whole number then add the product to

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.530 
the whole number then add the product to
the<00:01:27.830> numerator<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.790> sum<00:01:29.000> will<00:01:29.120> be<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.360> new

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
the numerator the sum will be the new

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.630 
the numerator the sum will be the new
numerator<00:01:29.950> repeat<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.040> process<00:01:31.220> with<00:01:31.520> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
numerator repeat the process with the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.450 
numerator repeat the process with the
second<00:01:32.000> compound<00:01:32.330> fraction<00:01:33.400> by<00:01:34.400> the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
second compound fraction by the

second compound fraction by the
numerators<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.900> denominators<00:01:37.300> convert

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
numerators and the denominators convert

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.630 
numerators and the denominators convert
the<00:01:38.420> product<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.320> compound<00:01:40.220> fraction

so Tim you do that all right everybody
that's<00:01:56.060> says<00:01:56.720> first<00:01:56.930> problem<00:01:57.290> multiply<00:01:57.770> three

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
that's says first problem multiply three

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.160 
that's says first problem multiply three
and<00:01:58.940> five-eighths<00:01:59.650> times<00:02:00.820> six<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.330> three

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
and five-eighths times six and three

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.240 
and five-eighths times six and three
nineteen<00:02:07.959> multiply<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.020> denominator<00:02:09.860> and

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
nineteen multiply the denominator and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.699 
nineteen multiply the denominator and
the<00:02:10.670> denominator<00:02:10.780> was<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:12.110> again<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the denominator was what again the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:25.230 
the denominator was what again the
bottom<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.220> bottom<00:02:13.700> number<00:02:13.880> yeah

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.400 

mother<00:02:26.240> just<00:02:26.420> call<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.960> bottom<00:02:27.260> number

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
mother just call it the bottom number

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.700 
mother just call it the bottom number
the<00:02:28.690> denominator<00:02:29.690> sounds<00:02:30.200> like<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.380> Swartz

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
the denominator sounds like a Swartz

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.530 
the denominator sounds like a Swartz
Integra<00:02:30.980> movie<00:02:31.160> didn't<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:38.000> compound

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
Integra movie didn't it a compound

fracture<00:02:41.320> I'm<00:02:42.320> pretty<00:02:42.620> sure<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.890> means<00:02:43.070> that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
fracture I'm pretty sure it means that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.800 
fracture I'm pretty sure it means that
they<00:02:43.400> want<00:02:43.610> us<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.760> multiply<00:02:44.210> that<00:02:44.360> number<00:02:44.690> in

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
they want us to multiply that number in

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.590 
they want us to multiply that number in
that<00:02:45.020> one

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
that one
