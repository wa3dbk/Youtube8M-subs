00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello welcome to kitchen for all today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.359
 more spaghetti carbonara and for 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.820
 do we are going to need the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.570
 following ingredients 200 grams of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.500
 spaghetti 50 milliliters of cream for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.039
 Cook or milk cream 75 grams of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.439
 bacon or bacon cut into strips 40 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.789
 grams of cheese in my case is parmesan 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 powder a spoonful of butter 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.020
 egg 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.670
 salt oil and ground black pepper 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.830
 first thing we will do is cook the 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.930
 spaghetti so let's put water in 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.520
 We put a pot on a high heat and 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.980
 we wait until it starts to boil 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.199
 while we put the butter in a 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.449
 We put the pan on medium heat and 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.650
 we wait until it melts once 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.140
 that the butter has melted 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.930
 we put the medium-high heat we add 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.940
 The bacon 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 and we are going to follow it well in the beacon and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.140
 is ready so we put out the fire and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.790
 we said it once the water starts 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.790
 to boil add a little salt 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.180
 a little of oil 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.800
 and we put the spaghetti 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.430
 we are going to help so that they get 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.320
 all in the water 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 once we 've already gotten 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.450
 all the spaghetti let's leave it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.950
 Cook about 8 or 10 minutes 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.230
 move from time to time so you do not 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.910
 are stuck in the background have passed 10 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.590
 minutes and our spaghetti are already 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.510
 al dente so let's move on to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 drain them and we do it with the help of 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.050
 a drainer 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.650
 and to prevent them from sticking the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.650
 Rinse with cold water 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.100
 Now let's make the look of the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.400
 pasta so we put the egg in a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 container we add the liquid cream 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.630
 the cheese powder is not added to everything 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.240
 since we 're going to leave a little to 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.260
 decorate the dish after the pepper 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.910
 and there are 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.910
 and we went to mix it well 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.870
 once we have the sauce ready 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.940
 we reserve and continue with the recipe 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.890
 we put the pan back in the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 the bacon prevailed at high and high fire 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.000
 We wait until it is hot 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.430
 Once it is hot we add the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.970
 spaghetti that are already up and what 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.970
 we mix well 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.560
 from here we already have everything well mixed 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:40.209
 with one of the snow and this has happened and 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.010
 we mix it well once mixed well 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.379
 is ready to serve so I'm going to 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.810
 go to treat it here and you can see it 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.909
 place the exposed spaghetti and a 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.099
 little cheese that we keep before 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.780
 over with the amounts that we have 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.120
 fact they give us for two servings like 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.769
 this one looks delicious, so 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.769
