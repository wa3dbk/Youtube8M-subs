00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.149
 all this because the lime 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 what happens and m1 we are here in another video 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.699
 and as you can see here we are again 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.140
 in my desk we can preserve good 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.240
 as the title says that I'm going to teach 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.840
 to remove to install something called 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 course voice what is what he does for 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 what serves or fulfills the same function as 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 skype but for the games that now more 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 ahead we will see your options occupy 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 less performance than skype in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.950
 followed less long in the games than 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 that would come giving the skype not good 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.460
 let's go into this page that should 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 leave it in the description are going to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 download now weighs 30 mega is nothing 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 it's two seconds depends on your internet 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.850
 your connection and remember what I'm going to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.520
 continue to load log in give you 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.910
 to go and you see the coherence of that 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 once they are limited in raising a 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.510
 installer like this give you double click 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.370
 is in beta phase and good is going to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.250
 look like this we are going to install 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.810
 we hope that these install some 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.210
 seconds that verifies all the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.380
 installation as it is very fast 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.240
 that was for all the files 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.969
 a lot of things and while those that you 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.490
 explaining what the program would consist of 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.789
 itself the program like this to talk about 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.960
 in the games and if you are in a 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:30.020
 game in this case for example he reads it 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.450
 appears on one side at the side 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.520
 it appears who if any of those people 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.619
 who is playing both at the same 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.470
 party in that same place with that game 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.170
 that has that program automatically 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.149
 you can admire the call with him with 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.039
 just a click do not even have to 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.869
 call mined or add it to your calls 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.470
 that are with other friends is 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.310
 basically equal to skype but a lot 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.009
 best 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.590
 I'm going to pause a very second this is 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.360
 very fast but I'm going to go through the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.360
 same uncle not only expect so much 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.940
 well once everything was installed 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.990
 true once invented everything we are going to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.160
 throw 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.320
 installed successfully we will launch 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.120
 we hope are the seconds and he left us a 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.380
 desktop icon if I do not know what 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.830
 I will know if it will not be opened 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.450
 automatically as you can see here we 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.930
 verified one thing as you can see is 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.930
 in beta 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.660
 you would not mark this but well here 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.760
 is to touch a second internet connection 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 the whole customer will be sick of 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.630
 game make great add- ons 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.460
 installation of the game we enter this 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.710
 we start our session or if we do not 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.050
 we can not register here if not 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.580
 we found the place to start mission 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.580
 with username and password 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.659
 and perfect once we enter it tells us 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.489
 all 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.470
 this is if they want to download in the 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.840
 masters how can you see this serves to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.060
 almost all the games but I do not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.980
 I want because I do not have it I'm also 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.769
 new to this as you can see this from 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.269
 where the next immigration starts 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.610
 in gaming communication 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.340
 course and meet your favorite games 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.049

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:25.230
 communication experience this 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.230
 here it tells us that we have a real name 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.780
 with the click or we are going to put you city 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.730
 We can all put any 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.550
 Mexico 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.250
 but you do not have to put 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.080
 well let's put in the country just 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.240
 we seek our country from where they are 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.240
 Argentine partners and we write 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 i 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.680
 let's put it like that and we're going to jump you 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.880
 they can highlight if they do not want 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.640
 complete all this or you do the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.820
 next we finish as you can put 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.040
 says course boys you can synchronize with 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.470
 Friends lists from other software that 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.750
 is running between these systems 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.330
 we will not add any friends 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.670
 you this is simply to let 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.950
 they find you easier by 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.450
 example if you have a friend on skype 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.490
 the steam or bat battle.net if the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.980
 values that is whether they seek them or 7 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.130
 you look for them if you look for them 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.630
 is going to give a lot of characters from 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.230
 users with the same name if not 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.520
 wants to win 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.910
 exactly the staff that are 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.040
 Looking for him to be inside steam bskyb 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.280
 value or what you have nothing else 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.780
 that I have these then show 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.730
 the next as you can see it says 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.830
 adding this account will allow us if 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.650
 people that appear on your skype list 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.780
 of contacts as friends post courses 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.190
 explained we are going to say yes because 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.169
 he is me 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.539
 fx yes i am green 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.460
 and once we enter they take out with my friends 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.550
 that still do not have this with some 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.800
 yes and I can call them to the one that has 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.830
 Touch as you can see are not many but 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.490
 we will go on a little bit we are going to 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.870
 to start communicating here as 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.210
 can see we can create a room 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.050
 they started doing it they started a new 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.779
 session and invited your friends or leave us 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.190
 do it automatically instead of if 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:36.370
 your friends 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.830
 whole because we can also join one 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.290
 session uses a toy or code from the 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.390
 session to join to join your 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.390
 Friends can also use function 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.800
 inside the game to join your team 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.210
 clicking on the flame that you can 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.640
 appear on either side of the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.440
 screen in this case appears to me from this 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.529
 side 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.419
 good 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.639
 the whole subject of the configuration by 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.399
 example here they will have their friends and if 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.980
 not here they will have to add everything 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.750
 this 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.750
 some of which I have is one of those 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.670
 they have this software and I keep everything is 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.530
