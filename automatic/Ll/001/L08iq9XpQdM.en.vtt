00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the remote control when I first looked

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.200 
the remote control when I first looked
at<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> thought<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.939> really

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
at it I thought that was really

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.719 
at it I thought that was really
complicated<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> found<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> practice

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
complicated but I found out in practice

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.980 
complicated but I found out in practice
and<00:01:11.939> you'll<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> demonstrate<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and you'll see it when I demonstrate a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.530 
and you'll see it when I demonstrate a
little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.409> later<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:14.820> intuitive<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
little bit later it's very intuitive to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.420 
little bit later it's very intuitive to
use

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
use

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
use
I've<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.700> connected<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> player<00:01:18.570> using<00:01:19.080> an

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
I've now connected the player using an

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.340 
I've now connected the player using an
HDMI<00:01:19.979> cable<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.640> my<00:01:20.820> television<00:01:24.140> once<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> have
