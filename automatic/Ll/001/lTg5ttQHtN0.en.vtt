today I'm now going to talk about what
causes<00:00:04.230> paper<00:00:04.560> jams<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.990> paper<00:00:06.990> jam<00:00:07.379> is

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
causes paper jams I paper jam is

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.470 
causes paper jams I paper jam is
something<00:00:07.950> when<00:00:08.160> when<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.849> paper<00:00:09.269> gets

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
something when when the paper gets

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
something when when the paper gets
stored<00:00:09.809> inside<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.440> machine<00:00:10.800> while<00:00:11.160> it's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
stored inside the machine while it's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.030 
stored inside the machine while it's
trying<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> print<00:00:12.530> sometimes<00:00:13.530> they<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.799> ever

trying to print sometimes they can ever

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.950 
trying to print sometimes they can ever
be<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> broken<00:00:14.820> gear<00:00:15.240> or<00:00:15.630> warm<00:00:16.350> roller

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
be a broken gear or warm roller

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
be a broken gear or warm roller
sometimes<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.199> be<00:00:19.289> both<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.560> eager<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sometimes it can be both but eager but

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.599 
sometimes it can be both but eager but
most<00:00:20.820> mostly<00:00:21.619> emergences<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:23.070> only<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:25.609> now

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
most mostly emergences it's only one now

most mostly emergences it's only one now
you<00:00:26.670> may<00:00:27.000> ask<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.630> causes<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> paper<00:00:28.650> jam<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you may ask what causes a paper jam to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.049 
you may ask what causes a paper jam to
cause<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.970> happens<00:00:30.650> well<00:00:31.650> most<00:00:32.489> common

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
cause what happens well most common

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.810 
cause what happens well most common
problem<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> when<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> paper<00:00:34.440> cut<00:00:34.770> cannot<00:00:35.489> be

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
problem is when the paper cut cannot be

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.040 
problem is when the paper cut cannot be
picked<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> tray<00:00:37.219> or<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:39.030> paper<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:40.020> be

multi fed causing a gym as well it is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
multi fed causing a gym as well it is
good<00:00:44.610> idea<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> check<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.809> wrong<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.200> every

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
good idea to check your wrong with every

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.830 
good idea to check your wrong with every
time<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> change<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> toner<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
time you change the toner that is the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
time you change the toner that is the
bet<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> most<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.980> days<00:00:50.370> most<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
bet is the most see days most of the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.080 
bet is the most see days most of the
time<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.719> hrum<00:00:52.440> try<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.430> maintain<00:00:53.670> the

time the hrum try and maintain the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.439 
time the hrum try and maintain the
machine<00:00:54.829> it<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.670> idea<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
machine it is a good idea to do that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.069 
machine it is a good idea to do that
because<00:00:58.010> available<00:00:59.010> monitor<00:00:59.660> how<00:01:00.660> often<00:01:00.989> the

you can't there's also another option

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.040 
you can't there's also another option
that's<00:02:05.260> called<00:02:07.110> regeneration<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.280> rollers<00:02:09.280> I

that's called regeneration of rollers I
do<00:02:11.050> not<00:02:11.500> recommend<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.370> because<00:02:13.360> i<00:02:13.810> believe

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
do not recommend that because i believe

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.970 
do not recommend that because i believe
is<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> band<00:02:14.770> aid<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.310> abet<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.690> i<00:02:16.870> believe<00:02:17.830> is

and it's not a good idea i recommend

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.420 
and it's not a good idea i recommend
that<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.960> should<00:02:26.320> replace<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.740> rollers<00:02:27.250> with

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that you should replace the rollers with

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
that you should replace the rollers with
quality<00:02:28.150> are<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.930> or<00:02:29.230> quality<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.910> market

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
quality are we in or quality of a market

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.720 
quality are we in or quality of a market
but<00:02:32.590> i<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.190> i<00:02:33.760> prefer<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:36.310> replace<00:02:36.700> it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
but i but i prefer for you to replace it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
but i but i prefer for you to replace it
with<00:02:36.940> over<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:39.220> OEM<00:02:39.850> loss<00:02:40.030> is<00:02:40.209> long

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
with over in because OEM loss is long

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.540 
with over in because OEM loss is long
sometimes<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.340> cannot<00:02:42.880> get<00:02:43.560> OEM<00:02:44.560> anymore

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550

cleaning up rolls while you change the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.729 
cleaning up rolls while you change the
toner<00:03:16.680> that's<00:03:17.680> as<00:03:18.040> hell<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.610> prefer<00:03:19.450> people<00:03:20.410> use
