00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.250 
it now that looks kind of funky with all
the<00:03:41.030> circles<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.660> don't<00:03:41.840> know<00:03:41.900> if<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.109> like

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
the circles I don't know if you like

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.740 
the circles I don't know if you like
that<00:03:42.500> but<00:03:42.739> I'll<00:03:42.859> just<00:03:42.889> put<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.400> down<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.790> too<00:03:44.090> so

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
that but I'll just put it down it too so

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.420 
that but I'll just put it down it too so
this<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.079> same<00:03:45.290> side<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.769> rest<00:03:47.079> then<00:03:48.430> just

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
this the same side of the rest then just

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.439 
this the same side of the rest then just
click<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:50.030> up<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.260> bit<00:03:52.090> make<00:03:53.090> yourself<00:03:53.629> a<00:03:55.449> nice

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
click this up a bit make yourself a nice

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:02.950 
click this up a bit make yourself a nice
texture

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.360 

that's<00:04:03.960> not<00:04:04.730> ever<00:04:06.350> hello<00:04:09.710> not<00:04:10.710> down<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> little

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
that's not ever hello not down a little

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.610 
that's not ever hello not down a little
bit<00:04:12.410> then<00:04:13.410> I<00:04:13.500> go<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.680> luminance<00:04:18.620> yeah

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
bit then I go to luminance yeah

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.400 
bit then I go to luminance yeah
guys<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.100> guys<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.579> play<00:04:20.700> around<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.150> that

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
guys you guys can play around with that

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.360 
guys you guys can play around with that
it<00:04:22.410> would<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> be<00:04:22.770> wrong<00:04:22.890> with<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.220> that

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
it would it be wrong with it that

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.070 
it would it be wrong with it that
doesn't<00:04:23.520> really<00:04:23.730> matter<00:04:24.000> but<00:04:24.330> that's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
doesn't really matter but that's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.310 
doesn't really matter but that's
basically<00:04:25.320> what<00:04:25.650> i<00:04:25.740> use<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.930> then<00:04:27.930> if<00:04:28.200> you

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
basically what i use and then if you

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.630 
basically what i use and then if you
want<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.530> add<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.490> these<00:04:30.200> add<00:04:31.200> some<00:04:31.650> normally<00:04:32.610> I

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
want to add to these add some normally I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.740 
want to add to these add some normally I
don't<00:04:32.760> do<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.270> because<00:04:33.480> they're<00:04:33.600> definitely

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
don't do it because they're definitely

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.940 
don't do it because they're definitely
even<00:04:34.170> really<00:04:34.380> mattered<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:36.830> what<00:04:37.830> you're

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
even really mattered so what you're

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.950 
even really mattered so what you're
gonna<00:04:38.010> want<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> do<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.730> if<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.360> have<00:04:39.570> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
gonna want to do is if you have the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.990 
gonna want to do is if you have the
grayscale<00:04:40.890> gorilla<00:04:42.470> whatever<00:04:43.730> light<00:04:44.730> pack

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
grayscale gorilla whatever light pack

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.800 
grayscale gorilla whatever light pack
when<00:04:45.960> I<00:04:45.990> go<00:04:46.169> ahead<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:46.950> add<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.520> overhead<00:04:48.450> soft

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
when I go ahead and add a overhead soft

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.409 
when I go ahead and add a overhead soft
box<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:51.090> bring<00:04:51.900> light<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:53.460> just<00:04:54.000> like<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.270> look

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
box and bring light I just like to look

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.190 
box and bring light I just like to look
at<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:55.040> now<00:04:56.390> this<00:04:57.390> doesn't<00:04:57.630> look<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.990> best

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
at that now this doesn't look the best

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.620 
at that now this doesn't look the best
because<00:04:58.530> it's<00:04:58.770> casting<00:04:59.610> shadows<00:04:59.850> downwards

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
because it's casting shadows downwards

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.020 
because it's casting shadows downwards
so<00:05:01.440> what<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.620> usually<00:05:01.860> do<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.430> select<00:05:02.850> them

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
so what I usually do is I select them

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.300 
so what I usually do is I select them
all<00:05:03.830> move<00:05:04.830> them<00:05:05.070> over<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.400> bit<00:05:05.640> put<00:05:06.600> them<00:05:06.810> up<00:05:07.310> by

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
all move them over a bit put them up by

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.920 
all move them over a bit put them up by
get<00:05:08.700> a<00:05:08.729> little<00:05:09.030> bit<00:05:09.150> more<00:05:09.300> light<00:05:09.510> on<00:05:09.540> to<00:05:09.780> them

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
get a little bit more light on to them

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.050 
get a little bit more light on to them
you<00:05:10.470> just<00:05:10.620> want<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.860> rotate<00:05:11.070> them<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:12.030> that

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
you just want to rotate them so that

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.440 
you just want to rotate them so that
they're<00:05:12.360> like<00:05:12.600> almost<00:05:13.320> all<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:14.370> way

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
they're like almost all the way

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.730 
they're like almost all the way
horizontal<00:05:15.450> but<00:05:15.720> like<00:05:16.020> not<00:05:16.200> all<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.560> way<00:05:16.680> to

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
horizontal but like not all the way to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.900 
horizontal but like not all the way to
study<00:05:17.130> got<00:05:18.060> some<00:05:18.240> nice<00:05:18.419> shadows<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.990> there<00:05:19.910> so
