00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.680
 hi hello here I hope you are quite 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.420
 well and good we are in the review of a 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.309
 new script mode that elaborates on this 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.290
 pretty cool 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.700
 and good already has in itself a time that 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.460
 it came out but well I had not uploaded it 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.960
 because I saw in the comments of the forum 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.039
 that by the way obviously I'll leave it at 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.410
 the description so they can 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.270
 download that there were some problems 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.090
 with the same and good as they saw in the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.680
 title is about waypoints and for 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.320
 now we do not get lost so this one 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.690
 is going to return a mod as we can say 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.380
 what a must for a minecraft 0.9 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.140
 point what are the updates 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.370
 come out and it's pretty cool as 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 You can see on the top 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 left we have what is a w if you 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.010
 we click we appear these options 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.170
 here I put three points to be able 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.640
 show them how it works then 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.440
 ways for example I'll tell you how 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.260
 to create one we give in creating 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.610
 waypoints and here we will put the name 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.789
 that we want for example 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.500
 pumpkin that I have here in front of you 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.930
 we give ok then it shows us the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.330
 coordinates 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.030
 and there I would be telling them I had not had them 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.040
 climbed before because just yesterday in the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 I update it but when everything 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.950
 world was sleeping and then I was not going to 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.040
 make a video since it is 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.710
 he would probably wake up so 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.979
 I opted to do it at this time I open 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.979
 let's eat from day to day I said there 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.270
 it's ok and I put it like that if you put me in 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.799
 creative 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.359
 and ok and nothing else for for example to 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.179
 go to what is the pumpkin that we will be 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.000
 here and here is where we created the point and 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.640
 what this does is that this shows us 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.829
 the exact location is like a kind 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.659
 of gps shows us the exact location 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.060
 where we put that point that 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.640
 would be in this part in this whole area is 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.030
 an area I think like about six by three 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.179
 by three blocks in this area you could 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 spin like crazy and ok to remove it then 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.250
 we would only click it again and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.270
 she would be something that she fixed because 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.709
 well obviously if there is a 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.040
 update because it's because fix 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.510
 things for example as you can see in the 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.160
 part of the sides then there is a tache 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.190
 quoted if I click on the pumpkin 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.870
 something that was fixed and that many 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.940
 they complained was that if they took it for 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.440
 error click to touch and quoted then they were 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.450
 erased automatically did not send this 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.579
 message that he was sure of 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.769
 erase it so that fixed it and it's 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.629
 very good with these we are going to erase it and 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.390
 now for example I want to go to the a to z 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.360
 I found out there a little mushroom and 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.450
 but that looks very very very cute 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.780
 so let's follow the little arrow 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.489
 and it would be this here here already here 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.019
 indicates where is the point that would be 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.560
 this little mushroom in a trunk that I 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.360
 I found and ok we removed it and now 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.690
 we would go to a village that has a 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.180
 smithy 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.070
 ok we will follow the arrow again them 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
 I say it's like a kind of gps tells you 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.720
 where to go next to be able 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.300
 get to the point that you had marked 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.570
 previously it is not so much as a 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.720
 waypoint since good not like I started 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.360
 because in some huge rays of light that 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.280
 they tell you the way but well that's not 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.570
 I do not think it can be done is that 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.550
 I even like to say if you can or can not 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.740
 it can be done because suddenly I 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.320
 surprised or do things as is and 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.410
 well here would be what is this review 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.350
 and it would be this village the point I put it I think 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.600
 that next to this this torch 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.150
 here I put it ok let's follow it to 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.060
 right here in this tree and here 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.580
 would be ok we removed it and now by 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.380
 example find a language that is 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.970
 where they expose the wolves and well we're going to 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.340
 follow the arrow I tell you it's like that 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.600
 simple we can change between all by 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.160
 example right now that living in naval makes 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.050
 is it indicates to me that it is for her that 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.430
 it's where we just came from but how 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.769
 follow now more than the wolves 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.810
 ok and I tell them the download is in the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.420
 description of if you corrected some 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.420
 problems regarding this part of here 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.969
 some I think that later it did not work 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.640
 as it should be now that a 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.500
 little to see that we have this we put this and 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.730
 look at a problem that came in 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.340
 against it is that suddenly this is m 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.160
 it looks like this time so 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.650
 I will have to leave the game completely 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.320
 or that downloaded music with clear music 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.870
 I do not want I do not want to download anything 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.900
 ok we will be again we go back in 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.060
 I say to you even then you have suddenly from time to time 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.610
 in when some little problems but good 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.020
 they are minor problems and ok if you do not know 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.849
 where did I get this texture if they have not 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.149
 seen ok stopped 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.279
 if I have not seen in my texture video 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:48.830
 what would it be like for this paper 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:50.629
 cut out then I recommend you go to 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.539
 the description leave the video of the 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.790
 review and where you can download it or that 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.340
 we enter again 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.950
 and here we would be where we are where 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.050
 we are and well there in front would be the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.780
 biome that I deleted them then they erased 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.700
 I tell you there are still some problems like that 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.520
 that we hope that the creator already goes 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.470
 updating little by little here this was 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.810
 himself that I found that is where he 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.790
 they find the wolves and nothing I think 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.360
 it would be all for this video in this way 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.640
 that is going to be essential in the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.920
 micro arp and with this from the worlds 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.540
 infinite and that is pretty cool them 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.520
 I say and I never thought they could do 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.800
 things like that but they always surprise me and 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.020
 that's great so I do not expect anything 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.210
 did you like this video this review 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.010
 in this way and you already know the link 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.440
 download in the inscription there will also be 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.960
 a link to a video of how to power 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.240
 install it if you do not know and also 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.460
 the video link of this texture is like this 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.980
 who liked it so I do not expect them to 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.590
 I liked it, I think I did not miss anything 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.670
 so we'll see you in a following 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.670
 video see you later
