00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
water in there to rehydrate them so I'm

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.349 
water in there to rehydrate them so I'm
just<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> pour<00:01:01.289> enough<00:01:01.530> water<00:01:01.699> to<00:01:02.699> cover

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
just going to pour enough water to cover

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.020 
just going to pour enough water to cover
the<00:01:03.539> crickets<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.189> I'll<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.549> mix<00:01:05.640> them

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the crickets and then I'll just mix them

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
the crickets and then I'll just mix them
up<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.780> make<00:01:07.049> sure<00:01:07.549> they<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.900> all<00:01:09.900> in

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
up a bit to make sure they are all in

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
up a bit to make sure they are all in
the<00:01:11.040> water<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> we're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> leave<00:01:13.200> them

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the water so we're going to leave them

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.620 
the water so we're going to leave them
there<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.799> 20<00:01:14.130> minutes<00:01:14.520> before<00:01:15.450> we

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

there for about 20 minutes before we
cook<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.570> fairly<00:01:18.869> simple

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
able to find it in Asian grocery stores

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.819 
able to find it in Asian grocery stores
in<00:01:44.729> other<00:01:44.909> countries<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> very<00:01:46.500> common

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
in other countries it's a very common

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.460 
in other countries it's a very common
tire<00:01:47.220> stock<00:01:47.579> powder<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.600> then<00:01:49.110> we've<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.409> our

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
tire stock powder and then we've got our

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.889 
tire stock powder and then we've got our
crickets<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.119> drained<00:01:51.570> after

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
crickets that we have now drained after

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.080 
crickets that we have now drained after
we<00:01:52.110> let<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.380> soak<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:52.860> 20<00:01:53.340> minutes<00:01:53.670> okay

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
we let them soak it for 20 minutes okay

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.640 
we let them soak it for 20 minutes okay
so<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:54.990> first<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> slide

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
so we are first going to slide

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.450 
so we are first going to slide
lemongrass<00:01:57.310> very<00:01:58.000> finely<00:02:02.220> next<00:02:03.220> take<00:02:03.430> your

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
kaffir lime leaf and split it in half

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.220 
kaffir lime leaf and split it in half
and<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:08.340> split<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.460> into<00:02:09.640> quarters<00:02:12.990> roll<00:02:13.990> it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
and then split it into quarters roll it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:27.110 
and then split it into quarters roll it
up<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:24.630> there<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.870> finished<00:02:26.170> product

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
up and there is that finished product

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.210 
up and there is that finished product
okay<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.180> we've<00:02:28.630> heated<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.110> wok<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.650> these

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
okay so we've heated that wok and these

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.670 
okay so we've heated that wok and these
are<00:02:30.640> actually<00:02:31.090> dry<00:02:31.390> fried<00:02:31.900> crickets<00:02:34.680> crickets
