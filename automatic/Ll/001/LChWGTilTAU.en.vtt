 in addition to letting immune hamburg take care 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.910
 control crowd control that would be 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.610
 this a pier halls and any other 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 crowd control and this utility can 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.060
 cause up to 160 plus 15% of its power 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.730
 total physique in each boom 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.250
 then you will attack for eight years and can 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.450
 160 plus 15 percent of your 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.900
 physical power 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.860
 If you hit every boy, he left giving 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.660
 What are you going to do to face this? 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.970
 closer and closer you can choose 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.700
 So much closer is he talking about a 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.700
 thing here even being illegal is legal 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.450
 to do the following items 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.180
 First I Like I Do The ninja tab de 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.269
 reduction of care 1 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.709
 then I do twitter km of life 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.840
 witnessed speed attack and in 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.840
 The truth is the card for allies. 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.040
 I do the executive will fight my 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.959
 passive giving the benefit or protection 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.810
 of the enemy and make a milk quiz that is 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.709
 very good that will give me the fiscal life 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.299
 power enough speed and will help against 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.440
 the tanks 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:12.320
 I make a rigid one is essential for everything 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.840
 adc will be very critical even strip 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.979
 30% criticize chance 15 loses 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.269
 speed is passive than that of those who 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.090
 you did not hit 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.480
 if you are the type who is not critical it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.090
 Here he is and he's here. 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.800
 and it seems that it is taking 5% more than 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.860
 chance to give one a critic then 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.240
 last does a must bring give me 50 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:45.740
 physical power 20% and criticize chances and 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:49.130
 and critical damage increase by 50% 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.170
 month leaving life 1 and protect yourself 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.400
 so see how he stayed he got 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:58.220
 250 physical power a boost 38 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.720
 speedy highlight leaving 0 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.450
 but here there will be lots of stuff 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.790
 I had a money there already the office that 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.100
 protect the guy so you do not need to 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.910
 so much by the way so will watch it 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.000
 15% if the south and have but if you 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.980
 want to change if you can switch to a voice 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.980
 penetration blade 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.540
 then of course the chance is 50 per 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.290
 cent plus 50% of the region's highlights 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.760
 so it's just pitiful care 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:40.370
 physical protection almost 117 from the grandmother of 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:46.010
 law will paint two thousand and one hundred 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:49.690
 seventy and 431 movement in skills 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:54.980
 I start with the 2 after I go to a 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:59.420
 then to 32 I maximizing her as 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:03.170
 oit and putting in 1 and nautical when 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.180
 should and lastly and maximize the number 3 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.430
 why one will give you an additional 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.930
 damage to friends in the area 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.930
 her then quite a motive 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.539
 like this 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.889
 ae
