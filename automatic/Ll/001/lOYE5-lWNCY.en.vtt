Flint drill can also double as a saw
which<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.900> very<00:01:15.170> effective<00:01:15.530> in<00:01:15.890> forming<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
which is very effective in forming the

forming the shafts straighten them by
hand<00:01:24.050> and<00:01:24.290> then<00:01:24.710> bundled<00:01:25.190> them<00:01:25.340> together<00:01:25.550> with

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
hand and then bundled them together with

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.510 
hand and then bundled them together with
natural<00:01:26.420> cordage<00:01:32.290> then<00:01:33.290> store<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.010> bundle<00:01:34.400> in

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
natural cordage then store the bundle in

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.710 

the<00:01:49.980> next<00:01:50.280> step<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.880> prepare<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.330> three

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the next step is to prepare the three

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
the next step is to prepare the three
feathers<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.500> be<00:01:52.650> used<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.160> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
feathers that will be used for the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.060 
feathers that will be used for the
fletchings<00:01:56.990> start<00:01:57.990> by<00:01:58.260> removing<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> feather

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
fletchings start by removing the feather

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.760 
fletchings start by removing the feather
fibers<00:01:59.550> off<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.240> end<00:02:00.510> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> quill

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.530 

next<00:02:07.770> trim<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> feathers<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.210> proper

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
next trim the feathers to the proper

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:23.410 
next trim the feathers to the proper
length<00:02:09.750> using<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.380> sharp<00:02:10.649> piece<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.100> Flint<00:02:22.310> and

length using a sharp piece of Flint and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.760 
length using a sharp piece of Flint and
run<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> Flint<00:02:24.840> down<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> length<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
run the Flint down the length of the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:45.240 
run the Flint down the length of the
feather<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.310> split<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.940> quill

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.800 

you

to<00:02:52.810> shape<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.230> fletchings<00:02:53.680> trim<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.220> feather

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
to shape the fletchings trim the feather

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.130 
to shape the fletchings trim the feather
fibers<00:02:54.849> with<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> sharp<00:02:55.390> piece<00:02:55.599> of<00:02:55.629> Flint<00:02:55.959> and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.260 

now<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.040> main<00:04:39.220> shaft<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.669> complete<00:04:40.060> we

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
now that the main shaft is complete we

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.770 
now that the main shaft is complete we
are<00:04:40.389> ready<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.810> make<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.139> dogwood<00:04:41.620> for<00:04:41.860> shaft

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.330 

start<00:04:46.780> by<00:04:46.990> using<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.410> piece<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.740> Flint<00:04:47.889> to<00:04:48.130> cut

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
start by using the piece of Flint to cut

00:04:48.340 --> 00:05:17.670 
start by using the piece of Flint to cut
the<00:04:48.460> four<00:04:48.669> shaft<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.270> proper<00:04:49.630> length

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.320

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
then scrape the base of the four shaft

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.300 
then scrape the base of the four shaft
so<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.140> will<00:05:21.230> tightly<00:05:21.650> fit<00:05:21.860> into<00:05:22.070> the

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
so that it will tightly fit into the

so that it will tightly fit into the
main<00:05:22.520> shaft

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.420 

next<00:05:48.170> we<00:05:48.320> are<00:05:48.350> ready<00:05:48.470> to<00:05:48.830> mount<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.160> stone

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
next we are ready to mount the stone

next we are ready to mount the stone
point<00:05:49.730> to<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.000> arrow<00:05:50.180> begin<00:05:51.020> by<00:05:51.320> forming<00:05:51.590> a

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
point to the arrow begin by forming a

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.500 
point to the arrow begin by forming a
groove<00:05:51.980> that<00:05:52.250> will<00:05:52.370> fit<00:05:52.550> tightly<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.330> base

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
groove that will fit tightly to the base

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:41.189 
groove that will fit tightly to the base
of<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.900> arrowhead

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.860 

now<00:06:42.099> you<00:06:42.550> are<00:06:42.639> ready<00:06:42.819> to<00:06:42.969> secure<00:06:43.509> the<00:06:43.629> point

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
now you are ready to secure the point

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.890 
now you are ready to secure the point
using<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:44.379> sinew<00:06:44.740> and<00:06:44.770> Burge<00:06:45.159> star<00:06:45.509> begin<00:06:46.509> by

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
using the sinew and Burge star begin by

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.439 
using the sinew and Burge star begin by
moistening<00:06:47.349> the<00:06:47.499> sinew<00:06:47.800> fibers<00:06:48.249> then<00:06:48.999> warm

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
moistening the sinew fibers then warm

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.059 
moistening the sinew fibers then warm
the<00:06:49.599> burchett<00:06:49.930> are<00:06:50.080> till<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.680> becomes<00:06:51.009> soft

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
the burchett are till it becomes soft

00:06:51.069 --> 00:07:18.980 
the burchett are till it becomes soft
and<00:06:51.520> pliable

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990

the<00:07:19.990> sinew<00:07:20.320> fibers<00:07:20.680> will<00:07:20.890> shrink<00:07:21.190> as<00:07:21.370> they<00:07:21.520> dry

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:21.730 
the sinew fibers will shrink as they dry

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.850 
the sinew fibers will shrink as they dry
forming<00:07:22.180> an<00:07:22.300> extremely<00:07:22.990> tight<00:07:23.230> bond<00:07:23.560> between
