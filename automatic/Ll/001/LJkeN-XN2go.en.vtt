00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.910 

so<00:00:00.510> now<00:00:00.630> we're<00:00:00.780> going<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:00.930> talk<00:00:01.170> about<00:00:01.350> tuning

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
so now we're going to talk about tuning

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.640 
so now we're going to talk about tuning
and<00:00:02.310> actually<00:00:03.060> tuning<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.570> instrument<00:00:04.110> the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
and actually tuning the instrument the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.059 
and actually tuning the instrument the
way<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.890> tune<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.580> chatter<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.290> by<00:00:07.290> moving<00:00:07.560> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
way to tune the chatter is by moving the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.180 
way to tune the chatter is by moving the
chanter<00:00:08.429> reed<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.880> or<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:09.900> what<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.679> want<00:00:10.920> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
chanter reed in or out what you want is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.790 
chanter reed in or out what you want is
a<00:00:11.429> nice<00:00:11.759> balance<00:00:12.150> between<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.200> low<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:14.750> and<00:00:15.800> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
a nice balance between the low a and the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:26.450 
a nice balance between the low a and the
high<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:21.439> nice<00:00:23.180> octave<00:00:24.180> interval<00:00:25.460> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
high a a nice octave interval the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
high a a nice octave interval the
intervals<00:00:26.910> between<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.359> other<00:00:27.689> notes<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
intervals between the other notes on the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.939 
intervals between the other notes on the
chanter

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
chanter

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
chanter
are<00:00:29.660> not<00:00:30.660> standard<00:00:31.500> Western<00:00:31.859> intervals<00:00:32.790> some

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
are not standard Western intervals some

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.209 
are not standard Western intervals some
of<00:00:33.420> them<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.660> slightly<00:00:34.140> sharper<00:00:34.680> than<00:00:34.920> others

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
of them are slightly sharper than others

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.430 
of them are slightly sharper than others
some<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.149> slightly<00:00:36.420> flat<00:00:36.960> than<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
some of them are slightly flat than a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
some of them are slightly flat than a
standard<00:00:37.860> interval<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> scale<00:00:43.860> on

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
standard interval so the the scale on

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
standard interval so the the scale on
the<00:00:44.430> bagpipe<00:00:44.969> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.040 

putting<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.590> chanter<00:00:57.010> into<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.150> pipe<00:00:58.390> I'll

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
putting the chanter into the pipe I'll

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.180 
putting the chanter into the pipe I'll
now<00:00:59.740> demonstrate<00:00:59.980> how<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.700> can<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.040> better

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
now demonstrate how you can get a better

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:33.459 
now demonstrate how you can get a better
sense<00:01:03.340> of<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.820> balance<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:05.350> chanter

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.480 

so<00:01:34.469> what<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> did<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:35.219> I<00:01:35.460> set<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.509> drone<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so what I did was I set one drone to the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.600 
so what I did was I set one drone to the
low<00:01:38.789> a<00:01:39.140> plate<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> low<00:01:40.500> way<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
low a plate the low way and then I

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.600 
low a plate the low way and then I
played<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> high<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.250> good

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
played a high a to see if it was a good

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.899 
played a high a to see if it was a good
pitch<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.590> chanter<00:01:47.219> is<00:01:47.340> slightly

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
pitch right now the chanter is slightly

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
pitch right now the chanter is slightly
flat<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.840> high<00:01:49.020> hand<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> had<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.460> move

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
flat on the high hand so I had to move

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.510 
flat on the high hand so I had to move
the<00:01:50.909> drone<00:01:51.149> up<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.799> get<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the drone up just a bit to get that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.080 
the drone up just a bit to get that
balance<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:54.569> need<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.090> put

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
balance I would need to go back and put

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.749 
balance I would need to go back and put
either<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.569> tape<00:01:57.810> over<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.289> or<00:01:58.920> change<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
either some tape over this or change the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.600 
either some tape over this or change the
position<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> reed<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.500> flatten<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.310> top

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
position of the reed to flatten that top

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.450 
position of the reed to flatten that top
hand<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> little<00:02:03.240> bit
