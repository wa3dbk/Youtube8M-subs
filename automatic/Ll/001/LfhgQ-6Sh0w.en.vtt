Hi there this is Betsy from Classroom Caboodle. 

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:08.066
I'm about to talk about what to do if you're asked to teach a lesson in a job interview.

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:23.398
Alright, what d'you do if you're asked to teach a lesson in a job interview for a teaching position?

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:31.061
Y'know it's happened to me and I can honestly say that it was one of the better interviews

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:41.231
that I've ever given when I was allowed to 
show the interview committee what it is I can do with kids

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:46.402
and although it was very nervewracking 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.992
 because you don't know what to expect it's a great way to highlight your skills. 

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:57.760
So if you get that call inviting you to an interview and to be prepared to teach a lesson

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:05.243
 you're gonna want to ask some clarifying questions to make 
sure you're meeting the expectations of the interview committee. 

00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:09.637
For example, you'll want to know what grade level do they want to see?

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.844
What subject would they like to see?

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:17.906
Do they have specific standards in mind that they would like you to teach?

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:24.186
How much time are you gonna have and what resources are available?

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:30.552
Y'know for example if this is a technology based school
 you need to find out if you're gonna be using PowerPoint, 

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:35.706
if they have projectors if they have a smart board
 or if all you're gonna have is what you bring with you.

00:01:36.053 --> 00:01:44.703
The next thing after you have your specifics for what you're expected to do

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:48.622
 is you're gonna want to customize that to the building you'll be working in 

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:53.429
so you need to find out what's the general socio-economic status of the students

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:56.397
so you kinda know where the kids are coming from. 

00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:02.877
Find out about the neighbourhood so you can tie in
 some real world concepts that kids will be familiar with.

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:10.198
Find out if you can if that building uses a workshop model, if they do a lot of small group work. 

00:02:10.726 --> 00:02:16.921
You'll want to know how that building operates so you can plan that into your lesson. 

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:25.478
Something else you'll want to for sure make sure you do is build in accommodations

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:31.508
for special ed students and for English Language Learners.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.012
We always make accommodations for those kids. 

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:43.767
Alright, so you're gonna have pretty much 6 things you're gonna do to teach a great lesson.

00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:47.611
First of all you want to engage your audience.

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:52.449
So whether or not your interview committee maybe you'll want to ask them first 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.520
if they're gonna act like students or if you're just going to explain a lesson you would teach. 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:09.612
Either way you're always gonna engage your audience with
 a story, with a mini-lesson, something to engage them. 

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:12.113
If you can do a short little video or a song for example. 

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.218
Tie something to the real world.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.337
So you're going to introduce the topic in an engaging way and then of course

00:03:20.655 --> 00:03:23.688
you're gonna present the standard or standards that you're teaching.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.368
And it should be one or two standards for something so short. 

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:33.598
And after you do your intro present the standard you're gonna check for understanding,

00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:38.093
see what they're already know. So if you're acting like your audience is 5th graders,

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:41.682
you would invite them to say what do you already know about this topic

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.370
and maybe they would be able to share a couple of things with you.

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:49.111
Now you want to be able to show that you have a way of getting that information,

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:54.379
such as a turn and talk and share or doing a whip around. 

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.548
Those are two ways to get that information.

00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:03.285
Then you're going to model a hands-on activity and let them try that out. 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.086
Again this can be pretty quick. If you only
 have 10 to 15 minutes it's easily done in that amount of time.

00:04:11.282 --> 00:04:13.271
So what do I mean by hands on activity?

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:20.268
It might be a little short worksheet with maybe two items on it

00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:28.521
where a student or the "student" would be demonstrating they
 understand how to show what they know on that standard.

00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:32.725
 It could be a writing prompt. Math problems with manipulatives. 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.322
It could be a white board activity or center cards if the school does a lot of centers.

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:44.370
It could be an example of a center card you would have students do for that activity.

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:53.415
While your interview committee or students are looking over these materials

00:04:53.755 --> 00:04:57.054
you would want to elicit from them some problem solving strategies 

00:04:57.343 --> 00:04:58.496
that you would highlight to the whole group.

00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:03.943
Ask them questions to get higher level thinking going. 

00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:06.254
You want to demonstrate that you can do that. 

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:11.827
Then the last thing you're gonna do, number 6., is to review what they learned.

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:15.038
You can do a think-pair-share or a popcorn.

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:22.421
Again these are all different ways of getting students engaged in sharing their ideas.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.581
So, then of course you're gonna wrap up by re-stating the standard

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.871
and saying "so, what we learned to day was..." and then name your standard.

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:37.473
Plan on bringing everything you need with you. 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.498
If you need a whiteboard then you need to have a small whiteboard,

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:47.660
a portable whiteboard and the markers and an eraser, everything you need to teach the lesson.

00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:52.563
 Now, here's the big thing, you need to practice. You don't go in cold.

00:05:52.964 --> 00:05:56.123
You get your loved ones, your neighbours, your friends

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:04.716
 to act as the students and you want them to be making sure that you're making eye contact. 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:12.522
You want enthusiasm. Because you want this job, you want
 to work with kids and so you gotta be enthusiastic. 

00:06:12.868 --> 00:06:16.367
Make sure you're smiling throughout the process and giving positive feedback. 

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:22.216
Teach like you love it. That's why you're interviewing for this job. 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:27.233
 Now just a little don't.

00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:32.389
Something to keep in mind is, this interview committee has to sit through several candidates

00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:36.766
most likely so they will have been sitting for a while. 

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:43.151
And so I wouldn't expect the interview committee to be wanting to get out of their seats 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.290
and do a lot of physical activity.

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:48.450
Some of the women might be wearing heels, or dresses. 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:51.157
Here's the story that goes with that.

00:06:52.043 --> 00:06:57.069
In a particular job interview one of the candidates came in and decided 

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:04.261
one thing they loved doing was having students
 get their blood moving before they taught a new concept

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.258
 and so they made the interview committee get up and do a bunch of jumping jacks.

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:13.740
That was not well received especially by the women 
who were dressed very professionally in the audience.

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:22.740
So while a little bit of brain gym is great for example, if you do brain gym do it in a seated position.

00:07:23.115 --> 00:07:26.938
You can get your blood moving just by doing some other simple activities.

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:29.611
Or describing what you might have students do.

00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:35.649
So keep in mind that they might be acting like students but they don't really want to be the students.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:43.469
So those are my tips for what you have to do if you're teaching a lesson in an interview.
