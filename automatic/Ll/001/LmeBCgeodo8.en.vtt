it to probably that kini makes is a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
it to probably that kini makes is a
canvas<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> definitely<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.380> different

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
canvas but it's definitely a different

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.590 
canvas but it's definitely a different
shape<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> canvas<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.680> see

shape this is the canvas and you can see
kind<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.780> area<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> difference

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
kind of area you can see the difference

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.060 
kind of area you can see the difference
the<00:01:27.090> Canon<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> definitely<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.320> longer

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the Canon is definitely like longer

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.590 
the Canon is definitely like longer
vertically<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:31.560> more<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
vertically and it's more of like a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.920 
vertically and it's more of like a
narrow<00:01:33.600> compact<00:01:34.409> frame<00:01:35.000> still<00:01:36.000> thin<00:01:36.390> temples

narrow compact frame still thin temples

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.520

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but this one is definitely like a little

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.420 
but this one is definitely like a little
wider<00:01:40.829> thinner<00:01:41.759> temples<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
wider thinner temples and not is the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.539 
wider thinner temples and not is the
