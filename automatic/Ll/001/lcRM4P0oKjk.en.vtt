video<00:00:07.440> we<00:00:08.010> are<00:00:08.040> starting<00:00:08.370> off<00:00:08.580> with<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
video we are starting off with the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.390 
video we are starting off with the
archer<00:00:09.870> blow<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.500> looks<00:00:10.710> like<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:11.099> double

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
archer blow just looks like to double

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.830 
archer blow just looks like to double
shot<00:00:11.550> from<00:00:11.700> maplestory<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.269> as<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:12.630> see

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
shot from maplestory but as you can see

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780 
shot from maplestory but as you can see
if<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.620> look<00:00:13.860> very<00:00:13.920> closely<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.549> diversify

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
if you look very closely you diversify

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.390 
if you look very closely you diversify
one<00:00:15.330> not<00:00:15.750> two<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:15.960> three<00:00:16.350> arrows<00:00:17.100> at<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
one not two but three arrows at the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.689 
one not two but three arrows at the
target<00:00:18.710> I'm<00:00:19.710> thinking<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> be

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
target I'm thinking this is going to be

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.640 
target I'm thinking this is going to be
one<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> basic<00:00:21.420> skills<00:00:21.720> from<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> archers

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
one of the basic skills from the archers

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
one of the basic skills from the archers
in<00:00:22.859> maplestory<00:00:23.430> 2<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.880> then<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
in maplestory 2 and then we have the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
in maplestory 2 and then we have the
spirit<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> Eagle<00:00:25.980> i'm<00:00:26.099> not<00:00:26.310> sure<00:00:26.519> what

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
spirit of the Eagle i'm not sure what

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240 
spirit of the Eagle i'm not sure what
this<00:00:26.789> skill<00:00:27.090> does<00:00:27.269> yet<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:27.990> i<00:00:28.199> think<00:00:28.859> it's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
this skill does yet but i think it's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
this skill does yet but i think it's
some<00:00:29.369> sort<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> birth<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> look<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
some sort of birth and if you look at it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.569 
some sort of birth and if you look at it
of<00:00:31.230> course<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.740> looks<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.160> buff<00:00:32.430> so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
of course it just looks like a buff so

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
of course it just looks like a buff so
it<00:00:32.669> must<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.180> i'm<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.360> sure<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> does

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it must be but i'm not sure what it does

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.620 
it must be but i'm not sure what it does
yet<00:00:34.489> then<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> sharp<00:00:36.030> eyes<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.510> well

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
yet then you have the sharp eyes so well

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.790 
yet then you have the sharp eyes so well
i<00:00:36.660> don't<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.899> explained<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> guys<00:00:37.590> with

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
i don't have explained you guys with

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.280 
i don't have explained you guys with
sharp<00:00:38.040> eyes<00:00:38.190> does<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.870> boosts<00:00:39.870> your<00:00:39.899> critical

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
sharp eyes does it boosts your critical

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
sharp eyes does it boosts your critical
rate<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.590> course<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> allows<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> do

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
rate of course and allows you to do

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
rate of course and allows you to do
massive<00:00:42.809> amounts<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.320> damage<00:00:43.559> next<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
massive amounts of damage next up is the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
massive amounts of damage next up is the
rapid<00:00:44.760> shot<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.379> rapid

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
rapid shot and as you can see the rapid

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
rapid shot and as you can see the rapid
shot<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.730> machine<00:00:47.940> gun<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.420> can

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
shot just is like a machine gun you can

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
shot just is like a machine gun you can
just<00:00:48.690> fire<00:00:48.989> away<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.440> monsters<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.520> looks

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
just fire away at monsters and it looks

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.340 
just fire away at monsters and it looks
like<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.180> leaves<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.539> burn<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:52.050> least<00:00:52.230> an

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
like it leaves a burn or at least an

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.069 
like it leaves a burn or at least an
explosion<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.610> quite<00:00:54.149> sure<00:00:54.180> that's<00:00:54.600> massive

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
explosion I'm quite sure that's massive

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
explosion I'm quite sure that's massive
amounts<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.440> damage<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.460> might<00:00:56.670> leave<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
amounts of damage and it might leave the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
amounts of damage and it might leave the
target<00:00:57.390> with<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> burn<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.410> next<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
target with the burn so next up is the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
target with the burn so next up is the
millet<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.309> shot<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
millet is shot and as you can see you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
millet is shot and as you can see you
just<00:01:00.539> fire<00:01:00.960> arrows<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.800> direction<00:01:01.980> I'm

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
just fire arrows in one direction I'm

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.380 
just fire arrows in one direction I'm
not<00:01:02.460> sure<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.760> choose<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> direction

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
not sure if you can choose the direction

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
not sure if you can choose the direction
if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> arrows<00:01:04.439> around<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
if you look at the arrows around the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
if you look at the arrows around the
tractor<00:01:05.489> but<00:01:05.670> yeah<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:06.990> looks<00:01:07.170> like

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
tractor but yeah this also looks like

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.800 
tractor but yeah this also looks like
one<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> basic<00:01:08.040> skills<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> Archer<00:01:09.060> so

one of the basic skills for a Archer so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
one of the basic skills for a Archer so
next<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.200> ice<00:01:10.439> arrow<00:01:10.799> yes<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> have

next up is ice arrow yes you have
multiple<00:01:11.700> elements<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.930> fire<00:01:13.200> multiple

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
multiple elements you fire multiple

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.800 
multiple elements you fire multiple
errors<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.520> direction<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.119> after<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
errors in one direction and after that
