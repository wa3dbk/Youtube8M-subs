wouldn't<00:00:46.890> make<00:00:47.039> much<00:00:47.190> sense<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.879> use

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
wouldn't make much sense so you can use

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.029 
wouldn't make much sense so you can use
it<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.270> an<00:00:48.360> external<00:00:48.719> display<00:00:48.870> also<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.829> you
