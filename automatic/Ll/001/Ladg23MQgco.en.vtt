00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.570 
kind of capture more and you can do this
with<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.570> web<00:02:01.780> page<00:02:02.050> in<00:02:02.560> any<00:02:02.950> scrollable

content on the phone if you can go down
for<00:02:05.920> more<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.400> can<00:02:07.030> do<00:02:07.150> all<00:02:07.300> that<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.720> then<00:02:07.780> I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
for more I can do all that and then I

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.800 
for more I can do all that and then I
when<00:02:08.020> I<00:02:08.080> had<00:02:08.230> done<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:10.119> has<00:02:10.240> all<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.540> for<00:02:10.780> me

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
when I had done it has all that for me

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.360 
when I had done it has all that for me
in<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.020> single<00:02:11.320> image<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.070> see<00:02:12.250> it's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
in a single image so you can see it's

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.240 
in a single image so you can see it's
you<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:12.730> babes<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.210> a<00:02:13.270> normal<00:02:13.630> image<00:02:13.780> i<00:02:14.250> can

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
you know babes like a normal image i can

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.040 
you know babes like a normal image i can
write<00:02:15.460> on<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.060> there's<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.930> know

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
write on it so if there's this you know

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.960 
write on it so if there's this you know
specific<00:02:17.590> turn<00:02:18.010> direction<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.730> want<00:02:18.760> to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
specific turn direction that you want to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.550 
specific turn direction that you want to
point<00:02:19.150> out<00:02:19.270> start<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.750> find<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.140> can<00:02:20.290> do<00:02:20.380> that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
point out start to find you can do that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.820 
point out start to find you can do that
save<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.580> gallery<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:22.240> gotta<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.380> one

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
save it in the gallery we gotta and one

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.760 
save it in the gallery we gotta and one
of<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:23.980> specs<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.490> this<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.930> 5.7

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
of the specs of this one so it's a 5.7

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.760 
of the specs of this one so it's a 5.7

three thousand million power and in

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.310 
three thousand million power and in
addition<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:55.780> our<00:02:55.930> new<00:02:56.080> fast

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
addition to that we have our new fast

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.890 
addition to that we have our new fast
charging<00:02:56.650> technology<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.730> or<00:02:58.060> improve<00:02:58.540> fast

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
charging technology so or improve fast

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.420 
charging technology so or improve fast
origin<00:02:59.290> technology<00:02:59.800> about<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> while

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
origin technology about it for a while

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.280 
origin technology about it for a while
but<00:03:00.489> these<00:03:01.239> devices<00:03:01.600> even<00:03:01.900> though<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.230> a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
but these devices even though it's a

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.470 
but these devices even though it's a
bigger<00:03:02.470> battery<00:03:02.739> than<00:03:03.070> galaxy<00:03:03.489> s6<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.270> going

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
bigger battery than galaxy s6 is going

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.310 
bigger battery than galaxy s6 is going
to<00:03:04.540> charge<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.050> same<00:03:05.230> amount

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
to charge in the same amount

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.520 
to charge in the same amount
intelligence<00:03:05.890> galaxy<00:03:06.250> s6<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.140> what<00:03:08.410> is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
intelligence galaxy s6 so and what is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.080 
intelligence galaxy s6 so and what is
the<00:03:08.620> charging<00:03:08.980> job<00:03:09.160> yeah<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.820> can<00:03:10.000> get

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
the charging job yeah so you can get

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.880 
the charging job yeah so you can get
about<00:03:10.180> half<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.630> charge<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:11.080> half<00:03:11.260> an<00:03:11.380> hour<00:03:11.500> so

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
about half a charge in half an hour so

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.740 
about half a charge in half an hour so
in<00:03:12.100> 30<00:03:12.400> minutes<00:03:12.610> ago<00:03:12.820> at<00:03:13.030> zero<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.510> fifty

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
in 30 minutes ago at zero to fifty

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.479 
in 30 minutes ago at zero to fifty
percent<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.410> super<00:03:14.769> fast<00:03:14.980> we've<00:03:15.280> increased

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
percent so super fast we've increased

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.400 
percent so super fast we've increased
the<00:03:15.670> wireless<00:03:16.120> charging<00:03:16.450> as<00:03:16.690> well<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.230> our

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
the wireless charging as well so our

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.530 
the wireless charging as well so our
phone<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.890> charge<00:03:18.160> wirelessly<00:03:18.459> as<00:03:19.030> fast<00:03:19.300> as<00:03:19.510> a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
phone can charge wirelessly as fast as a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.670 
phone can charge wirelessly as fast as a
lot<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.840> pet<00:03:20.080> owners<00:03:20.350> can<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.590> wired<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.400> this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
lot of pet owners can do wired so this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.289 
lot of pet owners can do wired so this
and<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.010> general<00:03:23.459> design<00:03:23.609> is<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:23.969> same<00:03:24.150> as

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
and the general design is the same as

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.149 
and the general design is the same as
previous<00:03:24.480> devices<00:03:25.049> yeah<00:03:25.319> pretty<00:03:25.530> similar<00:03:25.980> me

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
previous devices yeah pretty similar me

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.610 
previous devices yeah pretty similar me
you<00:03:26.280> see<00:03:26.700> some<00:03:26.969> subtle<00:03:27.659> enhancements<00:03:28.439> we're

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you see some subtle enhancements we're

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.619 
you see some subtle enhancements we're
like<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.340> aluminum<00:03:29.879> the<00:03:30.030> gold<00:03:30.299> when<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
like on the aluminum the gold when the

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.420 
like on the aluminum the gold when the
gold<00:03:30.870> are<00:03:31.079> now<00:03:31.230> kind<00:03:31.469> of<00:03:31.590> color<00:03:31.799> matched<00:03:32.099> wears

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
gold are now kind of color matched wears

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.920 
gold are now kind of color matched wears
on<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.640> previous<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.269> we<00:03:33.450> had<00:03:33.629> kind<00:03:33.900> of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
on the previous one we had kind of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.170 
on the previous one we had kind of
metallic<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.590> goal<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> little<00:03:35.730> subtleties

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
metallic and goal so a little subtleties

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.789 
metallic and goal so a little subtleties
there<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.930> give<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.200> its<00:03:37.349> unique<00:03:37.620> little

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799
