alright<00:00:02.600> this<00:00:02.780> is<00:00:02.840> my<00:00:03.469> little<00:00:03.590> work<00:00:03.860> shed<00:00:04.540> my

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
alright this is my little work shed my

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.930 
alright this is my little work shed my
studio<00:00:06.490> so<00:00:07.490> what<00:00:07.639> I<00:00:07.670> did<00:00:07.760> is<00:00:07.970> I<00:00:08.300> installed<00:00:09.940> hell

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
studio so what I did is I installed hell

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.049 
studio so what I did is I installed hell
outdoor<00:00:11.360> lamp<00:00:11.540> out<00:00:11.780> here<00:00:12.200> with<00:00:12.880> three<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:13.970> a

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
outdoor lamp out here with three and a

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.540 
outdoor lamp out here with three and a
half<00:00:14.090> watt<00:00:14.420> LED<00:00:15.580> and<00:00:16.580> then<00:00:16.820> I<00:00:17.000> went<00:00:17.720> in

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
half watt LED and then I went in

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.739 
half watt LED and then I went in
installed<00:00:20.079> seven<00:00:21.079> and<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:21.289> half<00:00:21.320> wat<00:00:22.599> seven<00:00:23.599> and

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:23.749 
installed seven and a half wat seven and

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.040 
installed seven and a half wat seven and
a<00:00:23.839> half<00:00:23.869> wat<00:00:25.089> and<00:00:26.089> another<00:00:26.390> seven<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:26.929> a<00:00:27.019> half

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
a half wat and another seven and a half

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.719 
a half wat and another seven and a half
wat<00:00:27.439> there<00:00:27.739> and<00:00:28.509> just<00:00:29.509> to<00:00:29.659> kind<00:00:29.869> of<00:00:29.929> simulate

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:30.729 
wat there and just to kind of simulate

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:39.099 
wat there and just to kind of simulate
the<00:00:31.729> difference<00:00:32.090> between<00:00:33.399> grid<00:00:34.399> power<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:38.109> DC

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
the difference between grid power a DC

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:47.829 
the difference between grid power a DC
inverter<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:44.019> little<00:00:46.449> DC<00:00:47.449> converter

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
inverter and the little DC converter

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.310 
inverter and the little DC converter
here<00:00:48.140> I<00:00:48.320> went<00:00:49.280> ahead<00:00:49.339> and<00:00:49.460> put<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:50.320> high-low

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
here I went ahead and put a high-low

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.259 
here I went ahead and put a high-low
switch<00:00:51.620> up<00:00:51.859> on<00:00:52.039> here<00:00:54.190> Center<00:00:55.190> off<00:00:57.940> just<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.089> we

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
switch up on here Center off just so we

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.779 
switch up on here Center off just so we
can<00:00:59.449> dim<00:01:00.199> them<00:01:00.350> if<00:01:00.530> we<00:01:00.679> want<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.489> i<00:01:01.550> went<00:01:01.699> ahead

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
can dim them if we want so i went ahead

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.560 
can dim them if we want so i went ahead
already<00:01:02.179> today<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.839> i<00:01:04.150> took<00:01:05.150> some<00:01:05.300> of<00:01:05.360> these

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
already today and i took some of these

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.140 
already today and i took some of these
measurements<00:01:06.700> basically<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> bulbs

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
measurements basically the bulbs

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.880 
measurements basically the bulbs
together<00:01:11.150> all<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.780> them<00:01:11.870> there's<00:01:12.320> four<00:01:12.560> bulbs

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
together all of them there's four bulbs

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.830 
together all of them there's four bulbs
they<00:01:13.580> are<00:01:13.790> rated<00:01:14.150> at<00:01:14.330> 26<00:01:14.930> wats<00:01:16.720> powering<00:01:17.720> by

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
they are rated at 26 wats powering by

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.110 
they are rated at 26 wats powering by
the<00:01:17.900> grid<00:01:18.790> I'm<00:01:19.790> through<00:01:20.330> an<00:01:20.420> amp<00:01:20.630> meter<00:01:20.780> and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
the grid I'm through an amp meter and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.640 
the grid I'm through an amp meter and

actually<00:01:24.860> is<00:01:25.070> 118<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:26.000> get<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.150> little<00:01:26.270> 100<00:01:26.870> 18.5

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
actually is 118 I get a little 100 18.5

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.770 
actually is 118 I get a little 100 18.5

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
extra-large four point oh 16 one thing I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.290 
extra-large four point oh 16 one thing I
notice<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> big<00:02:02.670> change<00:02:02.970> from

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
notice is it was a big change from

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.260 
notice is it was a big change from
running<00:02:04.280> bulbs<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.460> distance<00:02:06.350> around<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.650> room

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
running bulbs a distance around the room

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.250 
running bulbs a distance around the room
from<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.720> wat<00:02:10.289> draw<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.840> was<00:02:12.840> getting<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
from the wat draw that I was getting you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.729 
from the wat draw that I was getting you
know<00:02:16.320> just<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.720> real<00:02:18.720> short<00:02:19.050> run<00:02:19.260> setting

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
know just in a a real short run setting

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.229 
know just in a a real short run setting
you<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.820> with<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> battery<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.590> converter

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
you know with the battery the converter

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.650 
you know with the battery the converter
the<00:02:24.239> bulbs<00:02:24.600> all<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.959> next<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.320> each<00:02:25.350> other

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the bulbs all right next to each other

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.440 
the bulbs all right next to each other
this<00:02:27.660> number<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.410> number<00:02:29.450> we're

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
this number and this number we're

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.509 
this number and this number we're
definitely<00:02:30.870> lower<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.630> longer<00:02:33.900> your<00:02:34.170> runs

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
definitely lower so the longer your runs

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.570 
definitely lower so the longer your runs
the<00:02:35.519> harder<00:02:35.850> these<00:02:37.010> systems<00:02:38.010> have<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.250> work

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the harder these systems have to work

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
the harder these systems have to work
but<00:02:39.300> still<00:02:40.790> 26<00:02:41.790> wat<00:02:42.060> 16<00:02:42.630> watts<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.230> power<00:02:43.440> these

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
but still 26 wat 16 watts to power these

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.920 
but still 26 wat 16 watts to power these
bulbs<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:44.820> free<00:02:45.090> power<00:02:45.360> from<00:02:45.690> solar

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
bulbs if it's free power from solar

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.100 
bulbs if it's free power from solar
which<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.470> why<00:02:46.590> we're<00:02:46.769> doing<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.810> beats

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
which is why we're doing this that beats

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.150 
which is why we're doing this that beats
30<00:02:49.830> watts<00:02:50.070> off<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> grid<00:02:50.660> hugely<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> really

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
30 watts off the grid hugely so I really

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.690 
30 watts off the grid hugely so I really
don't<00:02:53.250> care<00:02:54.620> what<00:02:55.620> these<00:02:55.769> numbers<00:02:56.040> are<00:02:56.430> so

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
don't care what these numbers are so

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.000 
don't care what these numbers are so
much<00:02:56.910> as<00:02:57.120> long<00:02:57.299> as<00:02:57.450> they're<00:02:57.600> not<00:02:58.010> really

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
much as long as they're not really

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.440 
much as long as they're not really
really<00:02:59.459> wasteful<00:03:00.290> because<00:03:01.290> i<00:03:01.560> am<00:03:02.519> using<00:03:02.880> solar

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
really wasteful because i am using solar

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.680 
really wasteful because i am using solar
power<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.140> really<00:03:04.739> I'm<00:03:05.670> mainly<00:03:06.000> interested<00:03:06.150> in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
power so really I'm mainly interested in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.120 
power so really I'm mainly interested in
are<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> bulbs<00:03:07.290> bright<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.799> that's<00:03:07.980> what

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
are the bulbs bright so that's what

first this is the ljl five-point oh hold
DC<00:03:17.010> converter<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.850> can<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:20.090> outdoor
