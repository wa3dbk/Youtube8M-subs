00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a600 but other than that it's it's

a600 but other than that it's it's
really<00:01:45.810> nice<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.829> only<00:01:47.240> bad<00:01:48.240> thing<00:01:48.299> about<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
really nice the only bad thing about it

that I think that's not so bad is it

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.539 
that I think that's not so bad is it
it's<00:01:54.659> an<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.649> too<00:01:55.890> bad<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:58.549> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it's an it's not too bad but it's it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.539 
it's an it's not too bad but it's it's
just<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.630> thing<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.490> as

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
just a little thing is it's not as

and I
think<00:02:13.510> I<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.280> um<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.790> is

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
think I think that um I just this is

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.080 
think I think that um I just this is
kind<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.240> hard<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.480> explain<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:23.350> um<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.850> not

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
kind of hard to explain it's um I'm not

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.300 
kind of hard to explain it's um I'm not
sure<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.480> I'd<00:02:25.630> rather<00:02:25.810> take<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.200> quality<00:02:26.980> over

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
sure if I'd rather take the quality over

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.840 
sure if I'd rather take the quality over
the<00:02:27.430> come<00:02:27.760> over<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.570> comfort<00:02:29.050> but<00:02:29.770> um<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.280> think

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the come over the comfort but um I think

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.280 
the come over the comfort but um I think
the<00:02:30.970> comfort<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.780> going<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.990> take<00:02:32.230> some

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the comfort is just going to take some

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.740 
the comfort is just going to take some
getting<00:02:32.830> used<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.280> with<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:33.700> but<00:02:34.390> other<00:02:34.510> than

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
getting used to with this but other than

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.530 
getting used to with this but other than
other<00:02:35.260> than<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.830> whole<00:02:36.040> comfort<00:02:36.760> thing<00:02:37.150> with

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
other than the whole comfort thing with

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.840 
other than the whole comfort thing with
the<00:02:37.690> cushioning<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.920> really<00:02:39.370> nice<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:41.850> it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
the cushioning it's really nice and it's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.610 
the cushioning it's really nice and it's
broken<00:02:43.209> in<00:02:43.420> pretty<00:02:43.630> good<00:02:43.690> because<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.440> know<00:02:44.590> i

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
broken in pretty good because you know i

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.199 
broken in pretty good because you know i
said<00:02:44.890> it's<00:02:45.010> used<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.490> looks<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.000> person

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
said it's used it looks like the person

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.830 
said it's used it looks like the person
before<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:47.490> before<00:02:48.490> who<00:02:48.970> had<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.390> flared

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
before this before who had this flared

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.740 
before this before who had this flared
it<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.489> i'm<00:02:51.489> thinking<00:02:51.880> i'm<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.390> keep<00:02:52.570> it

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it and i'm thinking i'm going to keep it

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.710 
it and i'm thinking i'm going to keep it
flared<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.260> try<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.730> deeper<00:02:55.209> pocket

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
flared to try and get the deeper pocket

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.600 
flared to try and get the deeper pocket
and<00:02:57.630> that's<00:02:58.630> about<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.590> then<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:03:00.010> once<00:03:00.430> i

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
and that's about it and then I'm once i

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.030 
and that's about it and then I'm once i
get<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.300> using<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.870> games<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.530> stuff<00:03:02.770> I'll

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
get to using it in games and stuff I'll

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.400 
get to using it in games and stuff I'll
give<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> review<00:03:04.300> on<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:06.989> all<00:03:07.989> in<00:03:08.260> all

give you a review on it and all in all

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.520 
give you a review on it and all in all
so<00:03:09.250> far<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:10.239> really<00:03:10.510> nice<00:03:10.630> glove<00:03:11.020> I<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.380> it

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
so far it's really nice glove I like it

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.180 
so far it's really nice glove I like it
a<00:03:11.590> lot<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.270> colors<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:14.020> like<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.950> leather

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
a lot like the colors I like the leather

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.590 
a lot like the colors I like the leather
I<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:16.150> how<00:03:16.180> it's<00:03:17.310> not<00:03:18.310> padded<00:03:18.640> right<00:03:19.090> here<00:03:19.360> so

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
I like how it's not padded right here so

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.240 
I like how it's not padded right here so
you<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> better<00:03:20.230> feel<00:03:20.590> for<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:21.070> ball

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
you can get a better feel for the ball

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
you can get a better feel for the ball
on<00:03:21.930> for<00:03:22.930> quicker<00:03:23.290> transitions<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.250> stuff<00:03:24.519> but

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
on for quicker transitions and stuff but

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.280 
on for quicker transitions and stuff but
besides<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.769> whole<00:03:27.090> cushioning<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.299> stuff

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
besides the whole cushioning and stuff

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.100 
besides the whole cushioning and stuff
between<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.970> a600<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:34.630> this

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
between this and the a600 I think this

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.770 
between this and the a600 I think this
is<00:03:35.290> definitely<00:03:35.519> like<00:03:36.519> love<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.820> go<00:03:37.209> with<00:03:37.480> if

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
is definitely like love to go with if

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.039 
is definitely like love to go with if
you<00:03:38.620> if<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:39.459> see<00:03:39.670> both<00:03:39.880> of<00:03:39.910> these<00:03:40.239> no<00:03:40.840> matter

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
you if you see both of these no matter

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.890 
you if you see both of these no matter
how<00:03:41.489> comfortable<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.700> other<00:03:42.880> one<00:03:43.090> feels<00:03:43.450> or

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
how comfortable that other one feels or

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.130 
how comfortable that other one feels or
whatever<00:03:44.230> but<00:03:45.000> overall<00:03:46.000> i<00:03:46.450> would<00:03:46.630> i<00:03:47.080> would

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
whatever but overall i would i would

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.900 
whatever but overall i would i would
probably<00:03:47.739> take<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.100> over<00:03:48.280> anything<00:03:48.549> just

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
probably take this over anything just

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.820 
probably take this over anything just
because<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.269> it's<00:03:50.049> an<00:03:50.140> eight<00:03:50.260> two<00:03:50.380> thousand

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
because it's it's an eight two thousand

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.060 
because it's it's an eight two thousand
it's<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.010> nicer<00:03:51.340> glove<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:53.290> that's<00:03:53.709> that's

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
it's a nicer glove and so that's that's

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.390 
it's a nicer glove and so that's that's
it<00:03:54.340> i<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.549> wanted<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.000> show<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.690> what<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.959> got

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.750 
it i just wanted to show you what I got
let<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.580> know<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.120> my<00:03:59.130> 18,000<00:04:00.130> finally<00:04:00.519> came

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.890 
let you know that my 18,000 finally came
and<00:04:02.340> I'll<00:04:03.340> probably<00:04:03.700> have<00:04:04.030> another<00:04:04.299> video<00:04:04.540> out

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
and I'll probably have another video out

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.050 
and I'll probably have another video out
tomorrow<00:04:05.350> or<00:04:05.530> something<00:04:05.799> on<00:04:06.250> like<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.580> drill

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
tomorrow or something on like a drill

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.490 
tomorrow or something on like a drill
that<00:04:07.330> I<00:04:07.660> was<00:04:07.870> thinking<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:09.989> I'll<00:04:10.989> see<00:04:11.410> you

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500
