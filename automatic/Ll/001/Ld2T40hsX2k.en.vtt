know<00:01:43.770> why<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.040> gripe<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.640> level<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
know why one gripe with this level and I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.270 
know why one gripe with this level and I
guess<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:45.810> with<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> final<00:01:47.009> levels

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
guess that's with all the final levels

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.960 
guess that's with all the final levels
of<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> Megaman<00:01:47.850> games<00:01:48.090> except<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.909> don't<00:01:50.909> know

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610

battle<00:03:57.280> because<00:03:58.290> it's<00:03:59.290> only<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.590> one<00:03:59.829> time

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
battle because it's only a one time

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.390 
battle because it's only a one time
thing<00:04:00.129> thank<00:04:00.790> God<00:04:00.970> for<00:04:01.180> that<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:01.359> guess

probably<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:04.000> biggest<00:04:04.450> asshole<00:04:05.019> attack<00:04:05.349> he

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
probably the biggest asshole attack he

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.080 
probably the biggest asshole attack he
has<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.889> that<00:04:06.069> one<00:04:06.250> right<00:04:06.430> there<00:04:06.669> his<00:04:06.819> little

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
has is that one right there his little

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.240 
has is that one right there his little
ice<00:04:07.269> chart<00:04:07.689> attack<00:04:07.989> because<00:04:08.650> not<00:04:08.829> only<00:04:08.859> do<00:04:09.189> you

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
ice chart attack because not only do you

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.580 
ice chart attack because not only do you
have<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.639> avoid<00:04:09.939> the<00:04:10.150> initial<00:04:10.599> chunk<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.439> ice

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
have to avoid the initial chunk of ice

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.860 
have to avoid the initial chunk of ice
it<00:04:11.859> shoots<00:04:12.220> at<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.669> whenever<00:04:13.389> it<00:04:13.569> hits<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.840> wall

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
it shoots at you whenever it hits a wall

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.650 
it shoots at you whenever it hits a wall
or<00:04:14.319> ceiling<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.799> busts<00:04:15.400> up<00:04:15.519> into<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.819> 5<00:04:16.120> ways<00:04:16.389> red

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
or ceiling it busts up into a 5 ways red

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.080 
or ceiling it busts up into a 5 ways red
pattern<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.160> basically<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.789> to<00:04:18.910> dodge

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
pattern so you basically have to dodge

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.699 
pattern so you basically have to dodge
it<00:04:19.329> one<00:04:19.509> way<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.690> then<00:04:19.989> dodge<00:04:20.259> it<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> other

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
it one way and then dodge it the other

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.830 
it one way and then dodge it the other
way<00:04:20.889> but<00:04:21.160> like<00:04:21.759> I<00:04:21.880> say<00:04:22.090> once<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.449> learn<00:04:22.660> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
way but like I say once you learn the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.680 
way but like I say once you learn the
way<00:04:22.960> he<00:04:23.169> moves<00:04:23.440> and<00:04:23.830> don't<00:04:24.550> end<00:04:24.789> up<00:04:25.000> basically

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
way he moves and don't end up basically

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.040 
way he moves and don't end up basically

weakness<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:35.349> form<00:04:35.590> by<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.830> way<00:04:36.070> so<00:04:36.909> say

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
weakness in that form by the way so say

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.920 
weakness in that form by the way so say
he's<00:04:37.539> in<00:04:37.690> his<00:04:37.780> fire<00:04:38.110> in<00:04:38.349> his<00:04:38.560> flame<00:04:39.159> mode<00:04:39.930> using

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.490 
the Thunder chip will not deal any extra
damage<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.240> don't<00:04:43.419> even<00:04:43.510> try<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:44.199> lot<00:04:44.380> of

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
damage so don't even try that a lot of

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.409 
damage so don't even try that a lot of

people disagree with that but trust me
it<00:04:47.380> doesn't

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
it doesn't

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.010 
it doesn't

makes this battle fun and there it is
yeah<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:39.370> can't<00:05:40.370> really<00:05:40.810> describe<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.230> pattern

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
yeah I can't really describe the pattern

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.410 
yeah I can't really describe the pattern
you<00:05:42.800> need<00:05:42.920> to<00:05:42.980> use<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.430> beat<00:05:43.640> that<00:05:43.850> or<00:05:44.180> I<00:05:44.210> should

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
you need to use to beat that or I should

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.900 
you need to use to beat that or I should
say<00:05:44.570> to<00:05:44.630> get<00:05:44.810> around<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.350> but<00:05:46.310> hopefully<00:05:46.730> he

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
say to get around that but hopefully he

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.310 
say to get around that but hopefully he
does<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.240> twice<00:05:47.420> on<00:05:47.690> me<00:05:47.810> here<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.170> hopefully

just watching you can can be what you

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.070 
just watching you can can be what you
need<00:05:50.900> to<00:05:51.020> do<00:05:51.250> it's<00:05:52.360> you<00:05:53.360> need<00:05:53.510> to<00:05:53.630> trick<00:05:53.900> the

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
need to do it's you need to trick the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.860 
need to do it's you need to trick the
halos<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.830> where<00:05:54.980> they<00:05:55.130> allow<00:05:56.030> you<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.240> get<00:05:56.510> in

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
halos to where they allow you to get in

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.510

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
the center of the spikes after they

the center of the spikes after they
casts<00:05:59.000> that<00:05:59.810> makes<00:06:00.020> sense<00:06:00.370> probably<00:06:01.370> not<00:06:01.520> but

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
casts that makes sense probably not but

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.270 
casts that makes sense probably not but
I<00:06:01.790> tried<00:06:02.090> anyway<00:06:02.450> give<00:06:03.440> me<00:06:03.560> points<00:06:03.860> for<00:06:04.010> trying

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
I tried anyway give me points for trying

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.820 
I tried anyway give me points for trying
people<00:06:04.720> damn<00:06:05.720> it<00:06:05.870> almost<00:06:06.080> didn't<00:06:06.410> no<00:06:06.500> hit<00:06:06.710> on

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
people damn it almost didn't no hit on

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.500 
people damn it almost didn't no hit on
it<00:06:06.980> now<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.460> best<00:06:07.670> way<00:06:07.850> to<00:06:07.880> do<00:06:08.090> this<00:06:08.210> if<00:06:08.420> you

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
it now the best way to do this if you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.320 
it now the best way to do this if you
don't<00:06:08.720> have<00:06:08.870> a<00:06:09.410> charge<00:06:10.010> on<00:06:10.490> hardmode<00:06:10.880> I<00:06:11.060> should

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
don't have a charge on hardmode I should

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.200 
don't have a charge on hardmode I should
say<00:06:11.830> would<00:06:12.830> be<00:06:13.010> to<00:06:13.160> use<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.610> triple<00:06:13.880> rod

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
say would be to use the triple rod

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.820 
say would be to use the triple rod
because<00:06:14.600> it<00:06:14.720> can<00:06:14.870> reach<00:06:15.050> straight<00:06:15.440> up<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:15.770> you

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
because it can reach straight up and you

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.140 
because it can reach straight up and you
don't<00:06:16.010> have<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.250> jump<00:06:16.460> on<00:06:16.610> those<00:06:16.730> stupid

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
don't have to jump on those stupid

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.170 
don't have to jump on those stupid
pillar<00:06:17.390> things<00:06:18.430> and<00:06:19.430> it<00:06:19.550> makes<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.880> battle<00:06:20.150> a

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
pillar things and it makes the battle a

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.390 
pillar things and it makes the battle a
lot<00:06:20.210> easier<00:06:21.160> now<00:06:23.230> that<00:06:24.230> was<00:06:24.410> it<00:06:24.620> actually<00:06:25.160> and

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
lot easier now that was it actually and

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.610 
lot easier now that was it actually and
he's<00:06:25.820> been<00:06:26.060> beat<00:06:26.750> the<00:06:26.900> fuck<00:06:27.110> up<00:06:27.320> and<00:06:27.470> though

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
he's been beat the fuck up and though

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.710 
he's been beat the fuck up and though
he's<00:06:27.740> lying<00:06:28.280> in<00:06:28.460> pieces<00:06:28.670> there<00:06:29.180> which<00:06:29.390> is<00:06:29.540> good

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
he's lying in pieces there which is good

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.580 
he's lying in pieces there which is good
stuff<00:06:30.020> I<00:06:30.170> guess<00:06:30.910> and<00:06:31.910> it<00:06:32.870> turns<00:06:33.140> out<00:06:33.290> that<00:06:33.350> the

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
stuff I guess and it turns out that the

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.800 
stuff I guess and it turns out that the
reason<00:06:33.920> that<00:06:33.950> he<00:06:34.160> is<00:06:34.190> evil<00:06:34.670> he<00:06:34.790> is<00:06:34.820> actually<00:06:35.270> a

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
reason that he is evil he is actually a

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.280 
reason that he is evil he is actually a
perfect<00:06:36.710> copy<00:06:36.940> the<00:06:37.940> only<00:06:38.240> reason<00:06:38.570> is<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:39.110> only

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
perfect copy the only reason is the only

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.200 
perfect copy the only reason is the only
reason<00:06:39.620> that<00:06:39.650> he's<00:06:39.950> so<00:06:40.190> evil<00:06:40.550> it<00:06:40.670> turns<00:06:40.880> out<00:06:41.090> is

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
reason that he's so evil it turns out is

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.490 
reason that he's so evil it turns out is
because<00:06:41.360> he<00:06:41.780> didn't<00:06:42.050> go<00:06:42.140> through<00:06:42.350> the

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
because he didn't go through the

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.430 
because he didn't go through the
experiences<00:06:43.490> that<00:06:43.730> the<00:06:44.450> original<00:06:44.990> ex<00:06:45.170> went

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
experiences that the original ex went

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.380 
experiences that the original ex went
through<00:06:45.710> so<00:06:46.100> basically<00:06:46.520> he<00:06:46.790> was<00:06:46.910> pointed<00:06:47.270> to

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
through so basically he was pointed to

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.570 
through so basically he was pointed to
power<00:06:47.600> instead<00:06:48.290> of<00:06:48.350> having<00:06:48.680> to<00:06:48.800> get<00:06:48.950> it<00:06:49.100> if

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
power instead of having to get it if

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
power instead of having to get it if
that<00:06:49.760> makes<00:06:49.970> any<00:06:50.090> sense

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
that makes any sense

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.790 
that makes any sense
ah<00:06:52.060> now<00:06:53.060> for<00:06:53.300> a<00:06:53.330> real<00:06:53.660> self<00:06:54.050> destruct<00:06:54.560> a

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
ah now for a real self destruct a

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.530 
ah now for a real self destruct a
phantom<00:06:55.520> has<00:06:55.670> something<00:06:56.060> like<00:06:56.090> this<00:06:56.360> it

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
phantom has something like this it

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.880 
phantom has something like this it
probably<00:06:56.690> would<00:06:57.050> have<00:06:57.110> went<00:06:57.290> a<00:06:57.410> different<00:06:57.530> way

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
probably would have went a different way

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.010 
probably would have went a different way
but<00:06:57.950> this<00:06:58.850> little<00:06:59.120> firecracker<00:06:59.360> didn't

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
but this little firecracker didn't

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.110 
but this little firecracker didn't
amount<00:07:00.170> to<00:07:00.320> anything<00:07:00.430> this<00:07:01.430> is<00:07:01.640> a<00:07:01.670> bit<00:07:01.910> bigger

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
amount to anything this is a bit bigger

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
amount to anything this is a bit bigger
than<00:07:02.240> a<00:07:02.390> firecracker

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
than a firecracker

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.540 
than a firecracker
more<00:07:03.860> like<00:07:03.980> an<00:07:04.100> m-80<00:07:04.430> a<00:07:04.730> lot<00:07:05.270> of<00:07:05.390> them
