00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.130
 well it's everyone knows what 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 so I hope you're fine 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.700
 new strategic sheet that will bring 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.130
 on fuzzy 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.860
 the fire starter of the second 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.919
 generation fireworks that 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.620
 increases fire attacks by 50% 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.220
 if the pv's of the latter are lower 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 to a third of pv dax he also 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.420
 torch access what is his talent of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 world that I recommend since this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 talent booth 50% fire attacks if 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.750
 the pokemon suffered a fire type attack 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.490
 whether offensively or not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.640
 works great for will- o'-the-wisps 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.630
 more to offer immunity to the type does 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.520
 ion whistle has a very good 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.080
 special attack of new blood and a 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.810
 good speed blood 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.810
 the rest however is 78 pv means and 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.110
 in defense 84 in attack and 85 years 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.100
 defends special means yes 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.729
 so we will exploit the potential 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.250
 offensive of this pokemon because defensively 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.920
 in addition to its average stats the type 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.799
 is not the most advantageous type because 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060
 he takes 25 % on rock traps at 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.159
 because of his rock weakness 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.079
 he also has the ground weaknesses and a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.020
 weakness in and these are teams 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.759
 current but everything is not to throw because 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.270
 he still has a panoply of resistance 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.670
 interesting like the ice fairy steel 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.719
 insects and plants and immunity to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.920
 fire type if you play it with torch 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:44.009
 so let's start with this one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.959
 classic that of handkerchiefs choice on 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 is stuck on an attack gets a 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.969
 boost in speed is the effect of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.340
 handkerchief show nature speed the 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.939
 shy nature forgiveness to increase the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.729
 speed and distribution of 152 v 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.039
 special attacks and 250 speed cat 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.920
 peace defense will always be the same 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.600
 and this for all the sets so for the benefit 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.429
 handkerchief choice to be faster 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.979
 as the opponent and put the pressure 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.690
 with the eruption he attacks stab and who 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 sees its power decrease that the pv's 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.410
 the audience is weak as well 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.310
 eruption will be more powerful than 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.080
 deflagration cityflo ions to more than 73% 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.420
 of his life if not the opposite 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.950
 so we play the bursting eruptions 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.959
 exploit force for close relatives like 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.819
 governed where you had norms and finally 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.819
 the hidden power plants for 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.069
 twilight including a very set 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.569
 similar to the previous ones but this time 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.730
 here we play the telescope choice to make 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.010
 big holes in the opposing team in 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.780
 effective losio with glasses choice 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.150
 do not know a lot of resistance in 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.920
 night light and if rash blast 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.850
 came boosted by torch 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.050
 this one will become monstrous 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.300
 unfortunately you do not have a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.709
 move hen very varied but that does not 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.150
 prevent it from being very effective so we 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.220
 resumes the same blowout attacks 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.019
 deflagration the pc plant why 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.209
 pustules exploit force for the close relatives 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.450
 previously cited as governed by roch 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.660
 hutaree standards and or extra censor at 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.720
 choice for harry amaizo greece we're going 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.850
 pass a set with zenith and rock 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.470
 hot because kind no one dares not 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.940
 anyone in times and can 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.600
 easily put pressure on the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.910
 opposing team 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 you can then take the opportunity to 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.560
 place the sun is behind slammed 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.440
 big blast boosted including 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.160
 by the sun we play in the sun 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.810
 a turn instead of 2 thanks to the sun and 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.780
 I say a lot sun I find 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.720
 and finally last attack we play exploits 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.820
 force especially for the close ones already 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.530
 previously cited as rÃ©gis roch 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.660
 hutaree standards then the last set of 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.850
 this video for broadcast to 7 with 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.709
 nitro charge so we play either their 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.170
 quote for power or leftovers 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.519
 to regain pv so his recipes 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.260
 that we never see and who can 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.970
 surprise this this micro charge so 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.910
 an overload is a physical attack 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.090
 100% chance to increase speed 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.329
 a notch so we do not play this attack 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.709
 that for its effect that allows to have the 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.680
 same speed healthy shoes 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.690
 handkerchiefs choice without being stuck on 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.940
 an attack after use 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.470
 the rest is classic deflagration for 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.750
 the stadium explodes force for the rocks 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.490
 remarks giro contador and the apc plants 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.530
 to spit on 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.900
 so we'll talk about direct contracts 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.389
 flow with, in particular, 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.139
 mental that takes perfectly the 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.990
 rash blasts 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.069
 two types did not dare thanks to his 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.939
 excellent special defense that is 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.449
 140 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:43.340
 but you have to be careful to 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.499
 explore this for the other two sites 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.930
 and I'm thinking in particular about regies roques and 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:49.400
 at ryad then the benefits for the 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.930
 counterpoint of diffusion is that this 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.639
 last is usually play raw 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.779
 handkerchiefs choice glasses and that 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.729
 the time exist and can easily 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.620
 coming up on the onion- style tax 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.979
 especially sales has as I say 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.300
 that he takes his attacks well in general 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.379
 see now talk about partners 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.240
 of time tifos and I chose 

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.520
 four sexually 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.969
 because broadcast needs a fast 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.279
 Szpiner thus having all pokemon fast 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.379
 and I chose two fast laps of 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.090
 fast what hangs them an offensive 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.520
 exaggerates that I have already presented in a 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.279
 record and a defensive hi euros that I 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.779
 will surely soon present because without 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.060
 thread that often comes up in 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.379
 partners proposed big hard him getting 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.759
 complete rather well at the level of 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.949
 including weaknesses attended 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.469
 the opponent to make a fire attack that 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.930
 could activate torch on tiff losio 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.449
 and greasy hard especially place the traps of 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.370
 rock hill and who causes what can 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.439
 allow he ions to finish 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.360
 the opponent more easily and finally 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.669
 in a healthy team based on the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.819
 sun in udder flora can be a very 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.689
 good offensive partner and that's already the 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.000
 end of this video 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:55.099
 I hope this one you call 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.899
 do not hesitate as always left the 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.370
 little lake to tell me what you have 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:00.770
 thought in the comments space the 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.360
 comments are always welcome 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.759
