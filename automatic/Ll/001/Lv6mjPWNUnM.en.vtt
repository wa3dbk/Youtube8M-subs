either Angeles or tetra mara and I was

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.940 
either Angeles or tetra mara and I was
pondering<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.849> making<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
pondering in that video about making a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.189 
pondering in that video about making a
video<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> Carissa<00:00:14.639> macrocarpa<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
video of the Carissa macrocarpa and the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.210 
video of the Carissa macrocarpa and the
fruit<00:00:16.440> specifically<00:00:17.270> because<00:00:18.270> they're<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
fruit specifically because they're a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.340 
fruit specifically because they're a
minor<00:00:20.220> import<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.000> Florida<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.779> they<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.170> an

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
minor import in Florida but they are an

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.400 
minor import in Florida but they are an
edible<00:00:23.160> fruit<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:23.699> nonetheless<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.449> so

primarily<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.600> pretty<00:00:49.110> toxic<00:00:49.649> plant<00:00:50.010> family<00:00:50.510> so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
primarily a pretty toxic plant family so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.819 
primarily a pretty toxic plant family so
when<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> bite<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:52.710> I'm

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
when I have when I bite this thing I'm

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.110 
when I have when I bite this thing I'm
hoping<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> top<00:00:54.090> right

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
hoping and you can see on the top right

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.930 
hoping and you can see on the top right
oh<00:00:54.420> there's<00:00:54.600> latex<00:00:55.020> coming<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:58.699> sorry<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
oh there's latex coming out sorry and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.319 
oh there's latex coming out sorry and
you'll<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> latex<00:01:01.969> coming<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you'll see the latex coming out on the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
you'll see the latex coming out on the
edges<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.049> margins<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.650> fruit<00:01:04.949> right

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
edges of the margins of that fruit right

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.310 
edges of the margins of that fruit right
there<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.750> monkey<00:01:06.869> brain<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
there so your little monkey brain is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
there so your little monkey brain is
probably<00:01:07.470> thinking<00:01:07.710> well<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.090> good

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
probably thinking well that's not good

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.289 
probably thinking well that's not good
to<00:01:09.330> eat<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.780> primate<00:01:10.290> brain<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> guess<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to eat or primate brain I guess so I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
to eat or primate brain I guess so I
just<00:01:13.080> always<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.680> neat<00:01:13.890> when<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
just always think that's neat when you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.350 
just always think that's neat when you
bite<00:01:14.310> into<00:01:14.520> these<00:01:14.700> things<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
bite into these things they're good I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.660 
bite into these things they're good I
like<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.159> kind<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.490> off-putting

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
like them but kind of little off-putting

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
like them but kind of little off-putting
to<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> primal<00:01:19.380> brain<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to the to the primal brain to see that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.770 
to the to the primal brain to see that
latex<00:01:20.430> losing<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.360> especially<00:01:21.540> out

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
latex losing out of there especially out

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.219 
latex losing out of there especially out

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
of a the dogbane family so but good

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.960 
of a the dogbane family so but good
fruit<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.770> eat<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> Karissa<00:01:29.400> macrocarpa

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
fruit I eat them so Karissa macrocarpa

while<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.650> sort<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> scourge

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
while I'm here this is sort of a scourge

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
while I'm here this is sort of a scourge
of<00:01:35.850> gardeners<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.720> Florida

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of gardeners in Florida

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.480 
of gardeners in Florida
this<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.640> Vitus<00:01:39.409> it's<00:01:40.409> either<00:01:40.799> months<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
this is Vitus it's either months and I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
this is Vitus it's either months and I
or<00:01:41.729> more<00:01:42.240> likely<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> accepted<00:01:43.170> name<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
or more likely the accepted name is

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670 
or more likely the accepted name is
rotunda<00:01:44.250> folia<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> Fox<00:01:45.689> grape<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
rotunda folia but it's the Fox grape and

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.880 
rotunda folia but it's the Fox grape and
it<00:01:46.770> produces<00:01:47.130> an<00:01:47.280> edible<00:01:47.490> grape<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
it produces an edible grape here and I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
it produces an edible grape here and I
imagine<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.579> might<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:50.970> rootstock

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
imagine it might be good for rootstock

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.000 
imagine it might be good for rootstock
too

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
too

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.490 
too
and<00:01:53.450> over<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.220> rosary<00:01:56.220> pea<00:01:57.440> there's<00:01:58.440> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and over here is rosary pea there's a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.690 
and over here is rosary pea there's a
