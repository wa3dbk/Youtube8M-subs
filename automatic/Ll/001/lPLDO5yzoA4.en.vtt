knowledge<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> stuff<00:01:40.259> that

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
knowledge this is the stuff that

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.929 
knowledge this is the stuff that
absolutely<00:01:40.829> sucks<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.310> teach<00:01:41.490> brand<00:01:41.790> new

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
absolutely sucks to teach brand new

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
absolutely sucks to teach brand new
smash<00:01:42.150> players<00:01:42.450> hopefully<00:01:43.350> after<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.680> we'll

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
smash players hopefully after this we'll

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.520 
smash players hopefully after this we'll
never<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.549> again<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.049> real

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
never have to again so here we go real

quick I apologize that the gameplay
footage<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.570> interlaced<00:01:48.899> add<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.860> issues

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
footage is interlaced add some issues

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.469 
footage is interlaced add some issues
with<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> recordings<00:01:50.850> but<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> may

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
with the recordings but I think it may

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.450 
with the recordings but I think it may
have<00:01:51.509> solved<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.140> future<00:01:52.409> videos<00:01:52.770> the
