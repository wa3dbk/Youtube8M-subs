00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 love minecraft and minecraft 1 at 1 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:10.580
 we are really server here now 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.259
 Do not laugh, you can not do it better 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.920
 Simon and I are improving here 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.090
 here and there and the simon wanted something 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 exactly we are here on pvp point forces 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 It was a week ago 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.010
 We're having a fun time 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.859
 story happens i think you tell 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.829
 the customer though fast 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:37.140
 It was just like that if you have to stop yes 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.690
 So you can start here clearly 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.969
 because somehow you had stop 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.070
 that's just great what better something 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.489
 I do not know how to do it myself 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.230
 other truth the inhale of this 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.930
 server he wanted to come to us 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 otherwise we have a clown 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 you certainly dare but also took 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
 taken in the plan 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.720
 and then we just have all the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.479
 given permission and everything possible 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.630
 then it turned out that the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.850
 type easy to the people out there 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.330
 the whole time asks if you can step in it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 can 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.820
 with the clans and then has us easy 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 killed 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.090
 That's exactly where we asked 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.750
 have to build on our property with 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.880
 because there are also land 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 and yes and then he has our box 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.369
 destroyed where our whole was in today 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.930
 and just took us away like that 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.530
 So there we already thought something 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.750
 are for admins because that can be real 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.350
 Not be 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.899
 diamond is found, that's what you ask yourself 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.399
 really what's going on there 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.479
 astarloza inexplicable I am still 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.700
 not so long since I am only since 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.369
 today just did not have it 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.579
 bauhaus I'm as porridge knows it 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.599
 not so naked woman has that 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.910
 teleported away so kind what you 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:19.970
 want one of you away 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:24.140
 so clear if he really thought 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:27.170
 a little you can do all that yes 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 I just have to listen to it by hand 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.680
 is taken in the box of 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.220
 freezing cold she does all the things 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.740
 from the box what have you done 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.970
 I got a few things yes 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.980
 half diamond armor choir in 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.130
 silverstone shit i have there 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.200
 effective my convincing to all by 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.630
 Home is dead, please 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.940
 It took five seconds to do it 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.500
 you can interpret that 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.140
 he is somewhere makes fast as 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.930
 years away you spontaneously leave with you 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.510
 again 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.010
 So now I'm getting the starter kit 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.820
 and then we start 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:19.730
 I can come here then fuller 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.750
 Pain at the house awaits an armor 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.060
 in here because I wanted it now 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.440
 just rearrange then is also the two 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.020
 then you can have a sword 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:35.530
 Yes, I am doing everything right here 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.530
 just so do not be surprised 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.200
 I have you sometimes I have 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:53.620
 I accepted someone 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.620
 then I can leave all times 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:04.390
 which makes you so full in winter 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:11.200
 could let such a thought come to mind 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.950
 Do a little bit on the way first 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.680
 go upstairs 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.350
 a thin tower and branch of dark 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.870
 then it was more and more off that 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.290
 maybe not so cool but 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.450
 the advantage is that we are if you 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.970
 is a small path rides around it can 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.610
 just defend better and that is 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.310
 yes the point is pvp watt on me 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.050
 do not know no it is not 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.930
 So only with real pvp oh so good in the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.919
 extreme south looks very cool 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:48.880
 also in terms of their swiss has a cool 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:55.540
 castle yes, I am now any 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:05:01.600
 His pvp tricks have some kind of colors 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:05.200
 or something I have again and also 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.050
 with someone our stuff or there is 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.789
 Stone colors drive wood from the sand though 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.390
 if you have to want something like diamonds 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:17.860
 you get out of here because that 's peacetime 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:21.630
 so to speak we all have great 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.580
 enchanted thing right 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.410
 I've been to pvp before 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.410
 most of them retire and then 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:42.310
 zack at once they are there and have 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:43.210
 everything would have said to the kids instead of every 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.160
 there is also something to it 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:52.889
 we are eating with somebody now 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.889
 war between the longest stick 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:06.650
 all of that 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:11.420
 and does not do anything berlin me yet 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.420
 no idea is the cool pvp recording 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:22.110
 very short well then I get time to 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:25.590
 back in our room there is one 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.860
 invader am i know i have that 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:32.640
 with intention my god made such a 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.290
 I want to be close 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.200
 let's see how it is here 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:45.000
 go on shit at our house 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:48.710
 little source which we do not beat 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.710
 with a blooming song rust armor 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.900
 what do you want i think i will become one 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.810
 round meat will be for any 44 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:05.130
 People 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:13.260
 he think I also just let 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:22.620
 I take a great shot as 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:27.060
 Supertalent is something else 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:34.350
 What we wanted to discuss was not just that 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:36.030

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.890

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:48.980
 I wanted to ask where was points are 

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:54.810
 Everyone else has been okay there 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:58.340
 many people rather for fun to the good 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.340
 next shot and bye
