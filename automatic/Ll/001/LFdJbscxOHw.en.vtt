00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:37.740 
the head and also a little bit extra
time<00:01:35.679> to<00:01:35.830> make<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:36.160> absolutely<00:01:36.910> perfect<00:01:37.360> I'm

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
time to make it absolutely perfect I'm

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.900 
time to make it absolutely perfect I'm
stringing<00:01:38.140> traditional<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.709> a<00:01:38.830> little<00:01:39.700> bit

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
stringing traditional is it a little bit

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.059 
stringing traditional is it a little bit
weird<00:01:40.119> because<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:41.170> space<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.590> between<00:01:41.619> these

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
weird because the space in between these

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.040 
weird because the space in between these
and<00:01:42.310> spacing<00:01:42.700> between<00:01:42.819> these<00:01:43.119> leathers<00:01:43.840> a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
and spacing between these leathers a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.330 
and spacing between these leathers a
little<00:01:44.560> bit<00:01:44.649> all<00:01:44.709> by<00:01:44.830> me<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.039> this<00:01:45.160> heads

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
little bit all by me that this heads

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.949 
little bit all by me that this heads
really<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.880> don't<00:01:46.149> think<00:01:46.300> ever<00:01:46.479> really

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959

cool<00:03:07.299> because<00:03:07.389> mostly<00:03:07.750> people<00:03:08.049> go<00:03:08.169> a<00:03:08.379> little

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
cool because mostly people go a little

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.500

bit darker with the throne pockets

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.819
