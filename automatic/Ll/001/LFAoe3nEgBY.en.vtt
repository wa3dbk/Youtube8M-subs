00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
standard auto records to me originally

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.680 
standard auto records to me originally
was<00:00:03.710> a<00:00:03.740> business<00:00:04.189> but<00:00:04.430> it's<00:00:04.610> grown<00:00:04.940> a<00:00:05.180> lot<00:00:05.420> more

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
was a business but it's grown a lot more

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.389 
was a business but it's grown a lot more
than<00:00:05.870> that<00:00:06.020> whatever<00:00:06.560> they're<00:00:06.770> doing<00:00:07.040> here<00:00:07.190> is

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
than that whatever they're doing here is

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.990 
than that whatever they're doing here is
is<00:00:07.879> a<00:00:07.940> very<00:00:08.240> positive<00:00:08.450> and<00:00:08.870> good<00:00:08.990> thing<00:00:09.260> and<00:00:09.500> I

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
is a very positive and good thing and I

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.310 
is a very positive and good thing and I
think<00:00:11.000> they<00:00:11.090> should<00:00:11.120> be<00:00:11.330> supported<00:00:11.809> it's<00:00:12.170> been

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
think they should be supported it's been

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.350 
think they should be supported it's been
a<00:00:12.349> year<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:12.620> a<00:00:12.740> half<00:00:12.950> now<00:00:13.030> that<00:00:14.030> we've<00:00:14.179> been

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
a year and a half now that we've been

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.299 
a year and a half now that we've been
with<00:00:14.660> charity<00:00:15.170> cars<00:00:15.410> through<00:00:15.679> standard<00:00:16.130> auto

with charity cars through standard auto

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.400 
with charity cars through standard auto
and<00:00:16.670> it's<00:00:16.820> been<00:00:17.060> nothing<00:00:17.300> but<00:00:17.510> positive<00:00:17.840> in<00:00:18.260> so

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
and it's been nothing but positive in so

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.189 
and it's been nothing but positive in so
many<00:00:18.560> ways<00:00:18.789> standard<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:19.939> auto<00:00:20.330> wreck<00:00:20.539> they

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
community I learned right from the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.709 
community I learned right from the
beginning<00:00:37.790> that<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.120> know<00:00:38.239> what<00:00:38.450> I<00:00:38.480> would

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
beginning that you know what I would

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.619 
beginning that you know what I would
rather<00:00:38.899> walk<00:00:39.260> outside<00:00:39.800> on<00:00:40.100> dry<00:00:40.820> clean<00:00:41.300> land

rather walk outside on dry clean land

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.750 
rather walk outside on dry clean land
than<00:00:42.170> on<00:00:42.379> land<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:42.920> has<00:00:43.100> strewn<00:00:43.489> with

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
from a car what people don't realize is

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.860 
from a car what people don't realize is
that<00:00:49.520> Auto<00:00:49.879> Wrecking<00:00:50.180> is<00:00:50.420> one<00:00:50.600> of<00:00:50.719> the

that Auto Wrecking is one of the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.130 
that Auto Wrecking is one of the

pioneers of recycling I mean what would

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.779 
pioneers of recycling I mean what would
happen<00:00:54.440> if<00:00:54.559> you'll<00:00:54.710> just<00:00:54.860> let<00:00:55.070> their<00:00:55.219> cars<00:00:55.489> on

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
happen if you'll just let their cars on

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:56.650 
happen if you'll just let their cars on
the<00:00:55.879> side<00:00:56.030> of<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.149> road

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
the side of the road

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.110 
the side of the road
fluids<00:00:57.500> would<00:00:57.649> leak<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.920> rust<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.609> rust<00:00:58.879> out

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
fluids would leak a rust the rust out

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.549 
fluids would leak a rust the rust out
there'd<00:00:59.539> be<00:00:59.600> oil<00:00:59.809> in<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.109> environmental

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
there'd be oil in the environmental

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.319 
there'd be oil in the environmental
system<00:01:00.680> take<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.430> to<00:01:01.489> an<00:01:01.609> auto<00:01:01.760> record<00:01:02.149> the

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
system take it to an auto record the

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.630 
system take it to an auto record the
fluids<00:01:02.660> are<00:01:02.840> drained<00:01:03.079> properly<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:04.070> disposed

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
fluids are drained properly and disposed

fluids are drained properly and disposed
of<00:01:04.670> properly<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.900> metal<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.500> recycled<00:01:07.159> so

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
of properly the metal is recycled so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.690 
of properly the metal is recycled so
that<00:01:08.000> cuts<00:01:08.390> down<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:08.990> costs<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.710> building<00:01:10.549> new

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
that cuts down and costs of building new

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.800 
that cuts down and costs of building new
vehicles<00:01:11.479> so<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.810> real<00:01:11.960> positive
