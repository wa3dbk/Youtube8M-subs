00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:14.340
 Hello and welcome to the lame 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.980
 metin2 de france yes i still have it here 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 had a few shots of the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.170
 last pvp session we made there 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.740
 Here are some gradual ones again 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.539
 which I had not shown yet 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.789
 afterwards we march into it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.500
 yellow area 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.510
 if you pull right now 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.050
 but that was just a duel thing 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.420
 I get asked now yes that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.030
 Here is a relatively short video 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.899
 But I will definitely enter today 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.899
 bring video 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.890
 Just let yourself be surprised what now 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.160
 not how many hours can be too 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.300
 that it will come at 12 o'clock tomorrow but 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.239
 there is still a video to follow him 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.149
 But I'm a little bit stressed today 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.330
 I still have to prepare two videos 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.290
 I'm not there for monday and tuesday 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.360
 I'm in Germany 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
 that does not mean at the computer either 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.520
 That's why I have to watch that I have the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 upload videos scheduled so they do something 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.759
 you have to publish the publish 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.580
 then independently you only had to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.060
 a time devoted blabla is relatively new 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.140
 so cool 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 and here are yellow rich just times 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.079
 invaded wanted a bit pvb 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.020
 has fun then very fast 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.649
 worked that one must say so 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.439
 So the yellow empire looks empty 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 but if something is going on then they come 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.250
 all very quickly together 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.890
 Will you do it in the next 10? 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.400
 you definitely have to see that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.620
 to pronounce respect 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.620
 What a pity it is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.060
 never once another that enough 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.010
 other rich hijacks so have blue 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.740
 We immediately very rare and if you 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.820
 they know that two or three people and 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.720
 that's not really one 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.480
 Challenge 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.010
 So how we do that is just a stop 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.320
 a little bit bigger so we try 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.750
 together with ten people and you see 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.160
 have you quickly so people 20 30 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.510
 against you so you can imagine 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.390
 is it not so easy 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.140
 But I have already broached it 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.490
 so it does not matter in any case has fun 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.600
 made even if we then in the end 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.290
 get a bit in the mouth 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.570
 to have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.600
 but it clearly outnumbered and 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.970
 price advantage whole hold a lot 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.150
 But I believe in a scene 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.650
 at least or 12 10 we have it 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.760
 I managed that in the last one 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:03:01.150
 video here comes another wave 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:05.590
 and then two duels and see here 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.980
 we still have the one wave there 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.510
 relatively fast down always with you 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.310
 is attacked 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.000
 then I have the wrong one too 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:23.090
 Healed stops and now 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.730
 Immediately come the two duels duelle 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.730
 I have against I can have that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.349
 just do not pronounce 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.480
 let's call him Günter I know his 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.250
 but I do not know reallife names 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.950
 that's what you want to tell people like that and so on 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.019
 if you just günther and Günter 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.120
 also makes videos I introduce you 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.640
 Just put a video link below in the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.430
 description rhine is a very good la 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.989
 niña has not reached the top yet 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.109
 but is definitely good at it 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.209
 also a youtube channel with 1608 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.340
 I think so around the turn around as I said 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.200
 I'll just put a link in there 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.120

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.500
