to<00:02:05.690> actually<00:02:05.869> hear<00:02:06.259> my<00:02:06.290> name<00:02:06.650> being<00:02:06.680> called<00:02:07.009> by

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
to actually hear my name being called by

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.840 
to actually hear my name being called by
the<00:02:07.520> announcers<00:02:09.250> decided<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.310> be<00:02:10.399> a<00:02:10.429> speed

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
the announcers decided to be a speed

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.500 
the announcers decided to be a speed
back<00:02:11.180> because<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.810> know<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:12.230> size<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.740> weight

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
back because I know my size and weight

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.860 
back because I know my size and weight
will<00:02:14.510> become<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.020> factor<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.830> field<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.870> I

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
will become a factor on the field and I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.360 
will become a factor on the field and I
think<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.260> breaking<00:02:18.470> tackles<00:02:18.950> won't<00:02:19.100> be<00:02:19.220> too

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
think that breaking tackles won't be too

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.220 
think that breaking tackles won't be too

high school you played on the varsity

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.490 
high school you played on the varsity
team<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:39.690> think<00:04:39.900> I'm<00:04:39.990> gonna<00:04:40.080> go<00:04:40.350> ahead<00:04:40.410> and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
team I'm think I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.010 
team I'm think I'm gonna go ahead and
leave<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.800> on<00:04:41.010> varsity<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.760> bring<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.720> player

leave it on varsity and bring the player

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.000 
leave it on varsity and bring the player
minimum<00:04:43.560> speed<00:04:44.210> threshold<00:04:45.210> down<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.860> makes

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
minimum speed threshold down so it makes

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.820 
minimum speed threshold down so it makes
the<00:04:47.130> game<00:04:47.310> more<00:04:47.490> realistic<00:04:48.260> your<00:04:49.260> boys<00:04:49.470> shake

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
the game more realistic your boys shake
