to back the words I'm going to take some

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.649 
to back the words I'm going to take some
my<00:00:27.829> mind's<00:00:28.159> eye<00:00:28.489> decorative<00:00:28.970> tape<00:00:29.300> you<00:00:29.539> could

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
my mind's eye decorative tape you could

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.479 
my mind's eye decorative tape you could
also<00:00:29.839> use<00:00:29.989> the<00:00:30.229> lifestyle<00:00:30.710> crafts<00:00:31.099> shape<00:00:31.309> and

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
also use the lifestyle crafts shape and

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.930 
also use the lifestyle crafts shape and
tape<00:00:31.689> but<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:32.840> had<00:00:33.500> this<00:00:33.830> leftover<00:00:34.220> tube<00:00:34.610> of

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
tape but I had this leftover tube of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.940 
tape but I had this leftover tube of
decorative<00:00:35.900> tape<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.380> I<00:00:36.440> figured<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:36.770> might<00:00:36.890> as

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
decorative tape so I figured I might as

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.620 
decorative tape so I figured I might as
well<00:00:37.040> use<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.280> because<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:37.820> red<00:00:38.000> is<00:00:38.210> perfect

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
well use it because the red is perfect

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.390 
well use it because the red is perfect
for<00:00:38.810> Christmas<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:39.530> was<00:00:39.680> creating<00:00:40.130> kind<00:00:40.310> of

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
for Christmas and I was creating kind of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.750 
for Christmas and I was creating kind of
a<00:00:40.490> peppermint<00:00:40.850> candy<00:00:41.810> stripe<00:00:42.260> effect<00:00:42.950> so<00:00:43.580> the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
a peppermint candy stripe effect so the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.220 
a peppermint candy stripe effect so the
great<00:00:43.910> thing<00:00:43.940> about<00:00:44.090> why<00:00:44.390> she<00:00:44.450> taped<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:44.930> it<00:00:45.050> is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
great thing about why she taped to it is

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.870 
great thing about why she taped to it is
translucent<00:00:45.830> so<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.580> through<00:00:46.850> it

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
translucent so you can see through it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.540 
translucent so you can see through it
and<00:00:47.120> line<00:00:47.630> up<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:47.990> pattern<00:00:48.260> really<00:00:49.010> easily<00:00:49.430> so

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
and line up the pattern really easily so

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.400 
and line up the pattern really easily so
it<00:00:49.790> looks<00:00:50.000> very<00:00:50.210> seamless<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:50.900> when<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.170> look

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
it looks very seamless so when you look

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.990 
it looks very seamless so when you look
at<00:00:51.560> it<00:00:51.590> you<00:00:51.740> think<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.190> whole<00:00:52.370> piece<00:00:52.670> of

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
at it you think it's a whole piece of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.910 
at it you think it's a whole piece of
you<00:00:53.510> know<00:00:53.600> like<00:00:53.630> pattern<00:00:54.110> paper<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:54.650> can<00:00:54.800> also

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
you know like pattern paper you can also

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.530 
you know like pattern paper you can also
use<00:00:55.040> patterned<00:00:55.460> paper<00:00:55.640> if<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.880> don't<00:00:56.420> have

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
around especially you know close up to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.760 
around especially you know close up to
the<00:01:11.299> words<00:01:11.509> and<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:11.929> around<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.319> perimeter

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
the words and then around the perimeter

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.139 
the words and then around the perimeter
to<00:01:12.890> make<00:01:13.009> sure<00:01:13.130> I've<00:01:13.219> got<00:01:13.280> good<00:01:13.520> support<00:01:13.969> there

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
to make sure I've got good support there

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:15.639 
to make sure I've got good support there
and<00:01:14.450> then<00:01:14.749> I<00:01:14.780> like<00:01:15.049> to<00:01:15.200> look<00:01:15.380> right<00:01:15.590> through

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
and then I like to look right through

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.200 
and then I like to look right through
there<00:01:16.100> so<00:01:16.340> you<00:01:16.460> can<00:01:16.639> get<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.819> lined<00:01:16.999> up

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
there so you can get it lined up

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.459 
there so you can get it lined up
straight<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.569> obviously<00:01:17.990> I'm<00:01:18.139> having<00:01:18.439> a

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
straight and obviously I'm having a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:19.840 
straight and obviously I'm having a
little<00:01:18.560> bit<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.770> difficulty<00:01:19.189> there<00:01:19.520> because

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
little bit of difficulty there because

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.539 
little bit of difficulty there because
my<00:01:19.999> eyes<00:01:20.179> are<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:20.689> old<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.319> there<00:01:22.039> we<00:01:22.130> go<00:01:22.249> got<00:01:22.490> a

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
my eyes are so old but there we go got a

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.889 
my eyes are so old but there we go got a
nice<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:22.939> straight<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:23.569> we're<00:01:23.749> ready

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
nice and straight and then we're ready

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.349 
nice and straight and then we're ready
to<00:01:24.020> put<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.319> little<00:01:24.560> bit<00:01:24.740> more<00:01:24.969> adhesive<00:01:25.969> on<00:01:26.329> the

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
to put a little bit more adhesive on the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.749 
to put a little bit more adhesive on the
back<00:01:26.479> there<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:27.350> we<00:01:27.469> can<00:01:27.590> mount<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.069> a<00:01:28.310> card

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
back there so we can mount it to a card

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.270 
back there so we can mount it to a card
base<00:01:28.969> so<00:01:29.600> we'll<00:01:29.810> get<00:01:29.929> that<00:01:30.079> set<00:01:30.469> aside<00:01:30.859> and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
base so we'll get that set aside and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.980 
base so we'll get that set aside and
then<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.729> card<00:01:31.939> base<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.329> going<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.600> be<00:01:32.749> a

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
then the card base is going to be a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.919 
then the card base is going to be a
vertical<00:01:33.740> car<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.130> top<00:01:34.369> folds<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.359> I'm

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
vertical car that top folds and I'm

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.300 
vertical car that top folds and I'm
going<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.139> use<00:01:36.289> my<00:01:36.319> Martha<00:01:36.740> Stewart<00:01:37.100> mini

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
going to use my Martha Stewart mini

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.510 
going to use my Martha Stewart mini
board<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:37.880> score<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:38.600> line<00:01:38.929> there<00:01:39.259> at<00:01:39.530> five

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
board to score that line there at five

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.219 
board to score that line there at five
and<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.759> half<00:01:40.789> inches<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.719> whole<00:01:41.869> card

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
and a half inches so the whole card

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.080 
and a half inches so the whole card
panel<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.740> four<00:01:43.039> and<00:01:43.069> a<00:01:43.159> quarter<00:01:43.340> by<00:01:43.549> 11<00:01:43.969> and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
panel is four and a quarter by 11 and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.029 
panel is four and a quarter by 11 and
then<00:01:44.359> when<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.539> fold<00:01:44.689> it<00:01:44.810> in<00:01:44.959> half<00:01:44.990> its<00:01:45.439> four

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
then when you fold it in half its four

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.169 
then when you fold it in half its four
and<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.159> quarter<00:01:46.279> by<00:01:46.490> five<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.819> a<00:01:46.880> half<00:01:46.939> so

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
and a quarter by five and a half so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.660 
and a quarter by five and a half so
that's<00:01:47.329> just<00:01:47.389> a<00:01:47.600> standard<00:01:47.929> a2<00:01:48.139> card<00:01:48.499> and<00:01:48.829> then

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
that's just a standard a2 card and then

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.029 
that's just a standard a2 card and then
I'm<00:01:49.969> going<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.509> go<00:01:50.719> ahead<00:01:50.749> and<00:01:50.929> mount<00:01:51.170> my<00:01:51.560> panel

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
I'm going to go ahead and mount my panel

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.190 
I'm going to go ahead and mount my panel
there<00:01:52.279> and<00:01:52.549> there's<00:01:53.179> foam<00:01:53.420> dots<00:01:53.600> all<00:01:53.869> around

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
there and there's foam dots all around

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.589 
there and there's foam dots all around
so<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.409> whole<00:01:54.709> panel<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.340> elevated<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.299> then

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
so that whole panel is elevated and then

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.480 
so that whole panel is elevated and then
it<00:01:56.749> looks<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.349> stripes<00:01:57.799> there<00:01:58.249> are
