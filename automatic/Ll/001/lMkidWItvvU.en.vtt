00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.980 
fold it over on this side to get about
the<00:02:08.520> two<00:02:08.879> inch<00:02:09.060> loops<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
the two inch loops and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.250 
the two inch loops and
then<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.710> side<00:02:12.040> as<00:02:12.400> well<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:14.080> actually

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
then this side as well and I actually

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.370 
then this side as well and I actually
have<00:02:14.710> pinking<00:02:15.340> shears<00:02:15.690> once<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> bow<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.170> done

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
have pinking shears once the bow is done

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.050 
have pinking shears once the bow is done
I'm<00:02:17.560> going<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.740> trim<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.400> little<00:02:18.550> bit<00:02:18.820> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I'm going to trim it up a little bit and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.400 
I'm going to trim it up a little bit and
kind<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.300> fan<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.810> out<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:21.010> for<00:02:21.280> now<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.760> works

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
kind of fan it out but for now it works

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.640 
kind of fan it out but for now it works
with<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.620> loop<00:02:24.210> then<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.420> next<00:02:25.930> step<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:28.650> your

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
with the loop then the next step is your

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.620 
with the loop then the next step is your
orange<00:02:30.160> ribbon<00:02:30.520> which<00:02:30.760> i<00:02:30.910> dovetailed<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
orange ribbon which i dovetailed the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.860 
orange ribbon which i dovetailed the
ends<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.500> ribbon<00:02:32.860> phrase<00:02:33.340> um<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.420> actually

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
ends this ribbon phrase um so actually

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.490 
ends this ribbon phrase um so actually
though<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.380> do<00:02:35.530> use<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> lighter<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.030> burn<00:02:37.600> my

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
though I do use a lighter to burn my

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.530 
though I do use a lighter to burn my
ribbon<00:02:38.830> ends<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.310> lot<00:02:39.430> because<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.330> one

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
ribbon ends a lot because this one

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.770 
ribbon ends a lot because this one
phrase<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.290> much<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.770> actually<00:02:42.250> use<00:02:42.820> clear<00:02:43.360> nail

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
phrase so much I actually use clear nail

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.870 
phrase so much I actually use clear nail
polish<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.590> keep<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:44.980> from<00:02:45.250> fraying

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
polish to keep it from fraying

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.850 
polish to keep it from fraying
um<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:46.750> I've<00:02:46.840> already<00:02:46.960> put<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.200> on<00:02:47.470> there<00:02:47.710> and

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
um so I've already put that on there and

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.370 
um so I've already put that on there and
let<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.220> dry<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.210> again<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.510> was<00:02:49.570> 13<00:02:50.050> inches

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
let that dry so again it was 13 inches

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.340 
let that dry so again it was 13 inches
long<00:02:50.820> I'm<00:02:51.820> going<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.090> fold<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.810> half<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.050> get

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
long I'm going to fold it in half to get

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.210 
long I'm going to fold it in half to get
my<00:02:53.500> center<00:02:54.010> point<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.960> press<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.620> down<00:02:56.650> into

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
my center point and press it down into

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.140 
my center point and press it down into
the<00:02:57.340> mini<00:02:57.490> bowdabra<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.900> I'm<00:02:59.260> making
