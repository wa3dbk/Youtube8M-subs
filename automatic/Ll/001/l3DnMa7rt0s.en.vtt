00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.009
 eight classified teams and we're going to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.230
 hunt them among themselves knowing what 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.169
 yes of same nationality as any 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.700
 crossing that previously would have in 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.869
 groups or right now draw clean 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.869

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.100
 team 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.160
 full fausto so we're not going to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.300
 start with the draw 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.930
 sometimes what luck holds for the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.930
 cannon equipment 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.300

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.680
 paris saint germain athletic madrid 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.039

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.590
 Real Madrid 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.689
 let's see in Madrid if you have a 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 little bit of luck and it's not up to anybody 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.610
 Spanish barÃ§a or any other 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.300
 we have here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.890
 bayern de munich a real classic madrid 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.420
 Bayern Munich

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.260
 home game the second thing off 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.260
 that would be very difficult 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.720
 we have the performance of manchester 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.720

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.170

 Manchester United Good Match 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.160
 and only the other two would be left 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.060
 teams that would be the couple lying 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.060
 borussia of dortmund 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.950

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.780
