 of the branch that is green and how can 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.420
 see we only have 10 mb of ram 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.969
 available instead if we 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.950
 we give a tap to what is the circulito 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:44.490
 will start to liberate us what is the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.369
 ram as you can see it went up to what is 42 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.560
 percent of ram here be like here 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.899

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.110
 the little circle and well, we're going to 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.869

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.829
 thing else this other tip sorry and that is 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.470
 that they do not have many applications 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.019
 open in multitasking as that goes 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.879
 to remove what is ram memory 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.940
 just leave tight and close the 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.340
 apps and well then we go to the next 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.560
 to the next menu which are the processes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.510
 that are being carried out in our 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.850
 device as we can see from this 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.310

 There are 28 processes that are taking 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.150
 out on our device in the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.000
 next menu we have what is the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.120

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.080
 we have free of our memory and what 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.540

 this skull will help us close 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.000
 all applications that are 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.159
 consuming resources from multitasking 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.909
 for example if we have here 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.500
