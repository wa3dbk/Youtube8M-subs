00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it's got very bad HP and defense so it's

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.210

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
attacks but because of its special

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980 
attacks but because of its special
defense<00:00:19.590> even<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.220> its<00:00:20.369> low<00:00:20.550> HP<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.539> able

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
defense even with its low HP it is able

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
battle but it is gonna definitely hit

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.130 
battle but it is gonna definitely hit
incredibly<00:01:44.700> hard<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> ruin<00:01:45.600> something<00:01:46.020> is

willow<00:01:50.369> wisp<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.759> definitely<00:01:51.270> preferred<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
willow wisp is definitely preferred in

willow wisp is definitely preferred in
the<00:01:51.869> fourth<00:01:52.110> Moon<00:01:52.320> slot<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.700> up

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the fourth Moon slot and so how this up

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.410 
the fourth Moon slot and so how this up
usually<00:01:54.600> functions<00:01:55.110> best<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.490> bringing

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
usually functions best is by bringing

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
usually functions best is by bringing
flare<00:01:57.780> down<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.530> something<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> force<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
flare down in on something to force a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.570 
flare down in on something to force a
switch<00:02:00.290> predicting<00:02:01.290> around<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.799> switch

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
switch predicting around that switch

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.580 
switch predicting around that switch
and<00:02:02.670> either<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.180> for<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.510> flame<00:02:03.780> charge<00:02:04.140> so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and either going for the flame charge so

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.370 
and either going for the flame charge so
that<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.190> then<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.940> speed<00:02:06.300> base<00:02:06.690> 100

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that you can then out speed base 100

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.520 
that you can then out speed base 100
Pokemon<00:02:07.890> or<00:02:08.570> going<00:02:09.570> for<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> will-o-wisp

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
Pokemon or going for the will-o-wisp

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.290 
Pokemon or going for the will-o-wisp
and<00:02:10.619> burning<00:02:11.160> something<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.850> then<00:02:12.030> switching

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and burning something and then switching

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.820 
and burning something and then switching
out<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.810> bringing<00:02:13.080> fluttering<00:02:13.380> out<00:02:13.470> back<00:02:13.650> in

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
out for bringing fluttering out back in

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.320 
out for bringing fluttering out back in
later

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
later

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.690 
later
so<00:02:15.470> flame<00:02:16.470> charge<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> great<00:02:17.130> move<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.520> have

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
so flame charge is a great move to have

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.850 
so flame charge is a great move to have
just<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.180> give<00:02:18.420> Flair<00:02:18.720> them<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.110> extra<00:02:19.470> speed

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
just to give Flair them that extra speed

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.250 
just to give Flair them that extra speed
that<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.340> desperately<00:02:20.670> needs<00:02:21.360> if<00:02:21.990> there's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that it so desperately needs if there's

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.930 
that it so desperately needs if there's
something<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.500> able<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.520> flame

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
something I'm able to get up to flame

after<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.500> flame<00:02:37.770> charges<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.490> can

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
after to flame charges if you can

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.470 
after to flame charges if you can
somehow<00:02:39.480> make<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.560> work<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.120> most<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
somehow make that work but you most the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.640 
somehow make that work but you most the
time<00:02:42.660> you're<00:02:42.780> only<00:02:42.870> gonna<00:02:43.050> get<00:02:43.230> one<00:02:43.380> flame

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
time you're only gonna get one flame

time you're only gonna get one flame
charge<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.130> which<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.490> still<00:02:44.700> alright<00:02:45.030> because

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
charge up which is still alright because

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.310 
charge up which is still alright because
base<00:02:45.480> 100<00:02:45.990> is<00:02:46.110> not<00:02:46.140> bad<00:02:46.650> at<00:02:47.430> all<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.320> then

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
base 100 is not bad at all and then

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.120 
base 100 is not bad at all and then
you're<00:02:49.440> gonna<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.680> able<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.860> hit<00:02:49.950> things
