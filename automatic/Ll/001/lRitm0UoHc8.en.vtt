00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello people and in this video lesson today 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.740
 I'll tell you how to pack your microphone. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.450
 and let's assume a part of it is 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 For example, I was in the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.500
 right side and I got the 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 often happens for a long time. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 poor contact cables but first to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.010
 People look Logical part here in 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 of the computer also that the device 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.449
 I will not cry there write that the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.779
 speaker device right button 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.670
 of recording here that will have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 your microphone in a while and hence the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.070
 device tender to talk but you guys 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.440
 Are you having trouble listening to the then? 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.610
 here I hear that the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.739
 kuta type prices so a song ah me 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.710
 I 'm only on the microphone side, the sound 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.480
 on the other side of your microphone 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.340
 it's not working so people 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.260
 come here levels properties 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.500
 put up increases everything of all in the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.149
 Good thing if you do not 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.059
 had fought on both sides of the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.070
 headset the hit phone both does 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.290
 good are you watching here come to surface 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.909
 Maybe it's something that only 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.140
 give double click here mainly 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.560
 all this volume 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.570
 perhaps something that served me 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.630
 increases everything and now another fair with a 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.520
 now it's just that, now let's go to the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.429
 external part 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 Good people, I've jumped to leave now. 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.549
 external glory to the outside part of the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.030
 computer 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.600
 let's assume the whole tense microphone here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.340
 peraí peraí peraí peraí this here and this 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.789
 is the plaque of plant that is type 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.799
 a queen mother of the jet set the team 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.130
 make informed is that the volume was up 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.350
 this turns you to my low volume 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.840
 always let the maximum be low by 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.209
 computer if it does not suffer from problems 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.340
 always at the most and from here 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.640
 well firstly i'll explain another 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.399
 thing my wine protected with this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 Here I go, I got this face. 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.420
 what is happening is what is showing there 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.220
 the camera here showing the volume to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.440
 lower and increase volume 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.660
 the ranking is that it is ranking of the 27 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.760
 also for those who are lazy to buy 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.959
 the other metal reflects very expensive and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.660
 spoiled initially're here watching this 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.049
 string of cars to our lady did 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.389
 a lot of bullshit with this one is as follows 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.519
 perhaps the quality of his teaching tube 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:39.650
 French roads and leaves the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.540
 people instead of cursing initially 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.079
 open you will see an angry cable 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.250
 What are you doing, danny? What are you doing? 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:53.280
 this revolted cable connects him 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.190
 again however failure is seeing all 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.139
 the prongs here the microphone itself 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.940
 There's too much difference, you can connect. 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.000
 just any one of them goes that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.950
 sound will then work and if it is more than 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.959
 a car that we had nine hectares 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.019
 depending on the motherboard was more than one 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.540
 cable badly connected 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:17.400
 Then you follow the same sequence as the sale. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.209
 two sides only comes here goes 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.030
 around here 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.290
 here is a volume and then go inatel 27 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.100
 if you do not know how to fit these 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.830
 rights and not his 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.760
 on these grounds here you copy 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.940
 left side sequence in this team 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.090
 but put the red car disconnected 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.220
 and look that on the left side to see with 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.830
 ethics first stands and coop on the side 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.600
 Do the same thing now that I 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.740
 recommend to you put on cable 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.070
 place again 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:56.680
 You're in pain, if you do your tantrum or 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:01.630
 You're not a super tip with 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.700
 super glue superbonder knows you do 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.650
 and then you pass super bonder 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.310
 here is the same sequence as 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.800
 It worked 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.860
 obviously working, I recommend that 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.620
 you do this process is listening 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.130
 A song from Paul and how long have you been? 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.090
 go to where the wire is exactly 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.190
 to follow is not just listening to the music 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.100
 is tinkering with the wires 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.560
 rebel already detected is not even on the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.150
 motherboard here I pick up the wire goes when 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.870
 the motherboard until you hear the two 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.310
 sides 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.470
 you realize that this is that all 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.960
 two sides setecs super bonder 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.090
 child in that place is the simple 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.520
 not a very difficult thing to do and 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.249
 said 'he told the experienced show the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.579
 Man, because I'm really handsome. 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:55.649
 is to review fpf having registered I will not go 

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:55.649
 blame nobody football
