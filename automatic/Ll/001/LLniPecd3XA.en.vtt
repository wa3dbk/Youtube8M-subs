00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
berahino from West Brom he's only a 67

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.319 
berahino from West Brom he's only a 67
rated<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> officers<00:00:44.399> very<00:00:44.670> low<00:00:44.910> rated

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
rated from the officers very low rated

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
rated from the officers very low rated
and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.410> more<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and I think this one is more of a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.709 
and I think this one is more of a
correction<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.850> rating<00:00:48.360> rather<00:00:48.600> the

correction of a rating rather the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
correction of a rating rather the
natural<00:00:49.079> were<00:00:49.200> mainly<00:00:49.559> an<00:00:49.770> upgrade<00:00:50.070> because

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
natural were mainly an upgrade because

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.270 
natural were mainly an upgrade because
he<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.030> too<00:00:51.239> good<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.660> 67<00:00:52.199> rated<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:52.680> 73

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
he is too good to be a 67 rated but 73

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.950 
he is too good to be a 67 rated but 73
rate<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.670> me<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.940> probably<00:00:54.300> about<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:54.719> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actually a hinders Kirill but I think

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.679 
actually a hinders Kirill but I think
he's<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> looking<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> move<00:01:15.600> away

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
he's kind of looking for a move away

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
he's kind of looking for a move away
January<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.619> could<00:01:16.860> stop<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> I'd<00:01:17.580> never

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
January but that could stop it I'd never

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
have an absolute killer this season

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.280 
have an absolute killer this season
they've<00:01:32.700> overachieved<00:01:33.210> massively<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.869> they

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
they've overachieved massively and they

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
they've overachieved massively and they
do<00:01:34.350> key<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.040> my<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
do key there for my very well at the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240 
do key there for my very well at the
moment<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.360> James<00:01:36.689> Tomkins<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
moment so I James Tomkins is a one that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.620 
moment so I James Tomkins is a one that
I<00:01:38.369> imagine<00:01:38.729> Western<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.240> receive<00:01:39.509> about

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I imagine Western will receive about

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.690 
I imagine Western will receive about
three<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:39.930> four<00:01:40.049> maybe<00:01:40.320> even<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.700> upgrades

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
three or four maybe even more upgrades

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.429 
three or four maybe even more upgrades
this<00:01:41.820> January<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:42.869> were<00:01:42.930> 11

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439

this January and I think they were 11
key<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.100> probably<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.460> haven't<00:01:44.729> covered<00:01:44.850> this
