bear<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.350> me<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.500> am<00:00:52.710> left-handed<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> will

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
bear with me I am left-handed so I will

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.240 
bear with me I am left-handed so I will
be<00:00:53.940> moving<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.620> loom<00:00:55.800> when

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
be moving this way on the loom when

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.099 
be moving this way on the loom when
you're<00:00:56.579> probably<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> moving<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you're probably going to be moving this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.270 
you're probably going to be moving this
way<00:00:58.379> and<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> figure<00:01:01.710> eight<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.070> again

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
way and it is a figure eight so again

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
way and it is a figure eight so again
you<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.699> figure<00:01:03.000> 8<00:01:03.120> stitch<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:04.070> figure

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you are doing figure 8 stitch up figure

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.750 
you are doing figure 8 stitch up figure
8<00:01:05.189> shapes<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> peg<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.400> yarn<00:01:08.640> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
8 shapes so this is the peg the yarn is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.980 
8 shapes so this is the peg the yarn is
coming<00:01:08.820> from<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:10.439> over<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> skip<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> peg<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> I

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
coming from I go over I skip a peg and I

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
coming from I go over I skip a peg and I
loop<00:01:13.820> 100<00:01:14.820> me<00:01:15.720> J<00:01:15.869> again<00:01:16.700> basically<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.880> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
loop 100 me J again basically I do a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.880 
loop 100 me J again basically I do a
figure<00:01:18.330> 8<00:01:20.600> show<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.950> up<00:01:22.950> close<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.740> where

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
figure 8 show you up close this is where

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
figure 8 show you up close this is where
the<00:01:26.070> yarn<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.400> coming<00:01:26.729> from<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.330> skip<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.810> one

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the yarn is coming from I skip this one

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
the yarn is coming from I skip this one
take<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> over<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.920> wrap<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.400> around<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.909> back

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
take it over here wrap it around go back

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.380 
take it over here wrap it around go back
wrap<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.549> figure<00:01:32.759> 8<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
wrap it that is your figure 8 and it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.399 
wrap it that is your figure 8 and it
does<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:33.960> figure<00:01:34.110> 8<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
does look like a little figure 8 and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
does look like a little figure 8 and
then<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.460> point<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
then at this point what you do is you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.359 
then at this point what you do is you
just<00:01:36.450> knit<00:01:37.380> those<00:01:37.560> two<00:01:37.829> off<00:01:39.020> put<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.110> down

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
just knit those two off put them down

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.740 
just knit those two off put them down
now<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> yarn<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.880> coming<00:01:42.119> from<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.420> peg

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
now the yarn is coming from this peg

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.870 
now the yarn is coming from this peg
instead<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.490> doing<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
instead of this one so you're doing the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.410 
instead of this one so you're doing the
same<00:01:44.909> thing<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.170> around<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
same thing all the way around so the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
same thing all the way around so the
yarn<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.750> coming<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.409> peg<00:01:49.710> we're

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
yarn is coming from this peg we're

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
yarn is coming from this peg we're
skipping<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.180> one

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
skipping this one going to this one

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.179 
skipping this one going to this one
wrap<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> around<00:01:52.229> doing<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> figure<00:01:53.130> 8<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:58.189> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wrap it around doing a figure 8 and you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.080 
wrap it around doing a figure 8 and you
just<00:01:59.509> take<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> bottom<00:02:00.869> over<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> top<00:02:02.090> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
just take the bottom over the top you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.080 
just take the bottom over the top you
push<00:02:03.329> those<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:04.219> now<00:02:05.219> where<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.790> started

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
push those down now where we started

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
push those down now where we started
