 Many know Turin is one of the best 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.150
 from Manuela 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.630
 it is known area 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.200
 that is mainly because of it 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.470
 that he himself is in us all 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.420
 not just for a game 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 but it is an addiction 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.780
 especially authentic 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 So, in the Aachener Tor idea, you will be happy 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.610
 warm underwear and a pity the first few weeks do not forget that you us 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.090
 gets sick again 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.450
 so talk hears 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.079
 He has been aiming for a very important goal for a long time, though I want to 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.350
 that you are always right 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 in case I do not say that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.470
 We are of course pleased that we let him say to me again 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 To make a retirement last year that did not unload 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.610
 he knew how to vouch for them personally as he sees them transfer from Brussels 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.970
 but certainly suppress their report Â«Wuppertal 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 not for health reasons this time 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.730
 spared but it can always be so his reservations as Minister of Science 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.730
 that will be a very specific moment in his story 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.990
