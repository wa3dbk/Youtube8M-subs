architecture of the ipad air to my

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.490 
architecture of the ipad air to my
knowledge<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:27.000> i<00:00:27.599> don't<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.260> kind<00:00:28.410> of

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
knowledge so i don't know what kind of

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
knowledge so i don't know what kind of
difference<00:00:28.800> we're<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
difference we're going to see here and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
difference we're going to see here and
I've<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.960> know<00:00:31.019> cleaned<00:00:31.380> everything<00:00:31.650> out

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
I've you know cleaned everything out

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.880 
I've you know cleaned everything out
here<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.660> preparing<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.260> series<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.860> videos

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
here is preparing this series of videos

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
here is preparing this series of videos
and<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.700> I've<00:00:35.850> gone<00:00:36.090> through<00:00:36.149> them<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and as I've gone through them in

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
and as I've gone through them in
sequence<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.649> only<00:00:37.920> thing<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.309> running

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
sequence the only thing that's running

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
sequence the only thing that's running
in<00:00:39.059> memory<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> background<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> things

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
in memory in the background is things

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
in memory in the background is things
that<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.430> seen<00:00:41.670> already<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> screen

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
that you have seen already on the screen

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.720 
that you have seen already on the screen
so<00:00:43.170> let's<00:00:43.590> go<00:00:43.800> ahead<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.370> if<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.489> can't

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so let's go ahead and see if we can't

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.920 
so let's go ahead and see if we can't
open<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.149> feedly<00:00:45.629> simultaneously<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:50.930> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
open up feedly simultaneously here and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.479 
open up feedly simultaneously here and
as<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.710> loaded<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.129> pretty

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
as you can see it loaded in pretty

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.840 
as you can see it loaded in pretty
significantly<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.920> faster<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> ipad<00:00:56.579> air

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
significantly on faster on the ipad air

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.470 
significantly on faster on the ipad air
and<00:00:57.440> let's<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.649> ahead<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.940> get

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and let's go ahead and see if we can get

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
and let's go ahead and see if we can get
my<00:01:00.719> fingers<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.430> scroll<00:01:02.480> simultaneously

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
my fingers to scroll simultaneously

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
my fingers to scroll simultaneously
there<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:04.979> difference

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
there you don't see much difference

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.719 
there you don't see much difference
there<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:06.840> terms<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:08.280> looking<00:01:08.610> at

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
there in terms of what we're looking at

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.370 
there in terms of what we're looking at
let's<00:01:08.939> go<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> let's<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.020> go

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
let's go back one and let's just go

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.130 
let's go back one and let's just go
ahead<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.180> open<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.210> particular<00:01:12.630> article

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
ahead and open that particular article

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
ahead and open that particular article
again<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.850> go<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
again you can see as we go to that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
again you can see as we go to that
particular<00:01:15.570> article<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> loads<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.729> just

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
particular article that it loads in just

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
particular article that it loads in just
a<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.360> faster<00:01:20.600> just<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.900> bit

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
a little bit faster just a little bit

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.649 
a little bit faster just a little bit
faster<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.130> well<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> have

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
faster on that as well so there you have

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.620 
faster on that as well so there you have
it<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:26.189> ipad<00:01:26.490> 4<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:27.119> always<00:01:27.420> an

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it now the ipad 4 was always an

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
it now the ipad 4 was always an
excellent<00:01:28.229> performing<00:01:28.799> tablet<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:29.820> ipad<00:01:30.299> i

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
excellent performing tablet or ipad i

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.940 
excellent performing tablet or ipad i
guess<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.100> view<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.270> had<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.680> a6x<00:01:34.680> chip

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
guess in my view and had the a6x chip

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
guess in my view and had the a6x chip
and<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:36.000> everything<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.450> threw<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and just about everything i threw at it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.890 
and just about everything i threw at it
it<00:01:37.170> worked<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.619> very<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.460> well<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.600> said

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it worked very very very well that said

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.499 
it worked very very very well that said
the<00:01:40.110> ipad<00:01:40.590> air<00:01:40.890> has<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.430> taken<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.909> jump<00:01:42.180> with

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the ipad air has now taken a jump with

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.330 
the ipad air has now taken a jump with
the<00:01:43.290> a7<00:01:43.979> chip<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:45.360> can<00:01:45.570> see<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.340> already

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the a7 chip you can see that already

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
the a7 chip you can see that already
we're<00:01:47.670> looking<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.390> significant<00:01:49.200> speed

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
we're looking at some significant speed

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.800 
we're looking at some significant speed
and<00:01:49.970> improvements<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.329> performance

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and improvements here and performance

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.830 
and improvements here and performance
improvements<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.560> again<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.850> has<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> 64-bit

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
improvements and again it has a 64-bit

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.160 
improvements and again it has a 64-bit
architecture<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:56.100> once<00:01:56.430> developers<00:01:57.170> start

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
architecture that once developers start

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.859 
architecture that once developers start
working<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.759> architecture<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.600> start

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
working with that architecture and start

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.260 
working with that architecture and start
coding<00:02:01.530> their<00:02:01.680> apps<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.159> work<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.850> who

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
coding their apps to work with it who
