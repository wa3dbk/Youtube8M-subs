00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.490
 good morning we return to our having 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.350
 medication thanks to nourish cast today already 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.230
 let's talk about going light 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 of child athletes are in the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 school 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.699
 The concern of parents is that their 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.190
 children are fed as not only 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:41.300
 they have to perform in sports 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.030
 in my school and for that they need 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.539
 consume healthy snacks a 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.780
 athlete who trains daily should 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.390
 consume at least two snacks the ideal 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.390
 is that three watchmakers eat the first 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.519
 snack can be at the time of 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.210
 lunchbox schools is to 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.710
 half past ten 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.649
 another snack can be at one o'clock 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.440
 is before training and another snack to 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.570
 the seed between the snack has 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.319
 the characteristic of being easy 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.330
 digestion a small community is not 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.850
 a main meal are meals 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.360
 small and generally these 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.119
 Refreshments contain dairy fruits 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.119
 dried cereals fruits 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.670
 today thanks you use they will learn to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.850
 prepare snacks for the world 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.400
 let's go to the first one I'm going to show you two 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.280
 Refreshments that could consume them 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.649
 10 in the morning ten to ten and a half 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 in the morning may be for example a 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.980
 bread with cheese with tomato or lettuce and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.910
 two banderillas 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:59.690
 or it can also be a fruit a yogurt and 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.420
 nuts a handful of nuts 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.509
 it is the ideal 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.380
 after the refreshment of the from the 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.810
 tomorrow also and one hour before training 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.880
 so they have enough energy to 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.470
 to be able to resist a training of three 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.480
 intense hours should consume a 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.590
 hour before an extract of becerradas 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.450
 or it can be an orange juice 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.790
 if they can also accompany it with 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.739
 energy bars but at least yes 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.280
 should consume the extract of better 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.620
 nothing and orange juice one hour hour 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480
 and a half before your start 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.260
 training because it is very important 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.360
 for the amount of vitamins in what 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.940
 is they have for and in addition also 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.080
 simple carbohydrates to be able to attend 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.320
 in trend 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.420
 then when they come out of training when 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.580
 he has finished his training 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.460
 it is important that they eat immediately 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.560
 a snack that if they can be for 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.300
 example a parboiled egg and a 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 portion of nuts 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.260
 or they would also mean preparing a 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.150
 quina a little card that dodges with raisins 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.940
 accompanied nuts and milk of 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.010
 fruits 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.840
 or it could also be milk with a fruit 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.810
 which in this case is the banana and a 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.810
 Tray 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.050
 at the exit of the training then 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.200
 I'm showing three types of 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.980
 refreshments one that is the stone tomorrow 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.470
 another one that is an hour before training and 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.190
 when they leave training is very 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.800
 important that you do not have your 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.260
 children to consume the lightest ones already 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.140
 that if they do not consume them they will not be able to 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.569
 complete all the needs of 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.049
 nutrients that a child needs 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.549
 athlete at the same time is also 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.980
 important that you consult a 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.780
 nutritionist since not all 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.930
 athletes have the same schedule 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.660
 some have different schedules 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.030
 train at different times not 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.859
 then it is important to consult 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.780
 a nutritionist so that you can 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.300
 guide in terms of refreshments to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.040
 which will now consume us not for 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.680
 that do not cross with the meals 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.710
 main ones are the lunch the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.860
 breakfast lunch and dinner good ones 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.530
