00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
okay so this is my 15 gallon column tank

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.919 
okay so this is my 15 gallon column tank
it's<00:00:09.900> about<00:00:11.120> 13<00:00:12.120> inches<00:00:13.280> from<00:00:14.280> side<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.519> side

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929

13<00:00:15.929> inches<00:00:16.230> front<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> back<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.050> it's

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
13 inches front to back and I think it's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.920 
13 inches front to back and I think it's
about<00:00:19.529> 19<00:00:20.189> inches<00:00:20.430> tall<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.119> could<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.750> wrong

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
about 19 inches tall I could be wrong

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.269 
about 19 inches tall I could be wrong
there<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.710> those<00:00:22.830> are<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.130> like

there but those are just like

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.790 
there but those are just like
guesstimate<00:00:26.060> dimensions<00:00:27.060> but<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.500> tanks

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
guesstimate dimensions but this tanks

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.640 
guesstimate dimensions but this tanks
been<00:00:28.920> running<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.349> been<00:00:31.470> set

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
recently switched to this column tank to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.840 
recently switched to this column tank to
save<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.739> floor<00:00:50.399> space<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.949> really<00:00:53.039> really

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
save on floor space it's really really

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
save on floor space it's really really
nice<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.449> looks<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:54.840> good<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.350> have

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
can see I just kind of threw some

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.429 
can see I just kind of threw some
anubius<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.640> Java<00:01:15.390> ferns<00:01:15.869> there's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> balloon

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
anubius and Java ferns there's a balloon

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
anubius and Java ferns there's a balloon
Moll<00:01:16.680> he<00:01:16.950> rules<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> tank<00:01:17.640> there's<00:01:18.060> actually

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
Moll he rules the tank there's actually

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.490 
Moll he rules the tank there's actually
about<00:01:19.530> six<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.430> fish<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:21.259> he<00:01:22.259> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
about six other fish in there he just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
about six other fish in there he just
makes<00:01:23.340> him<00:01:23.490> high<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:24.000> all<00:01:24.119> come<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.360> at

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
makes him high they all come out at

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.749 
makes him high they all come out at
feeding<00:01:24.689> time<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> main<00:01:26.610> reason

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
feeding time but this is the main reason

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.109 
feeding time but this is the main reason
for<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> video

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
for the video

up at the top this big one up here and

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.700 
up at the top this big one up here and
the<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> treat<00:01:41.340> Korra<00:01:41.369> over<00:01:41.850> here

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
the can you treat Korra over here

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.679

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
SPS and some of the LPS like the Duncan

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
SPS and some of the LPS like the Duncan
whisker<00:01:53.280> coral<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.390> closed

very well from this video but there's a

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.870 
very well from this video but there's a

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
actually go in that space over there on

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.040 
actually go in that space over there on
the<00:04:35.979> left<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:38.970> more<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.210> stunner<00:04:40.510> strips

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
and then I have the Corelli it should

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.550 
and then I have the Corelli it should
actually<00:04:43.450> be<00:04:43.720> here<00:04:43.750> within<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.110> next<00:04:44.320> day<00:04:44.530> or
