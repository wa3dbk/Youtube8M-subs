00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
like figs so you want to check the fruit

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.399

bruised and make sure that the skin is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
bruised and make sure that the skin is
not<00:01:16.320> broken<00:01:16.829> it<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.189> actually<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> nice

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
not broken it can actually have a nice

not broken it can actually have a nice
shelf<00:01:18.810> life<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.920> you're<00:01:20.070> harvesting<00:01:20.250> it's

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
shelf life when you're harvesting it's

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.999 
shelf life when you're harvesting it's
important<00:01:20.969> to<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.149> there's<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:22.009> main

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
and for selling wholesale they tend to

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.830 
and for selling wholesale they tend to
want<00:06:29.700> a<00:06:29.790> little<00:06:29.970> bit<00:06:30.090> more<00:06:30.270> than<00:06:30.450> four<00:06:30.660> or<00:06:30.720> five

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
want a little bit more than four or five

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.400 
want a little bit more than four or five
at<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:30.990> time<00:06:31.170> so<00:06:31.350> it's<00:06:31.470> okay<00:06:31.650> to<00:06:31.710> use<00:06:31.800> a<00:06:32.130> larger

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
at a time so it's okay to use a larger

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.100 
at a time so it's okay to use a larger
packaging<00:06:35.030> maybe<00:06:36.030> not<00:06:36.210> too<00:06:36.390> large<00:06:36.630> because

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
packaging maybe not too large because

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.960 
packaging maybe not too large because
once<00:06:37.380> they<00:06:37.530> start<00:06:37.560> rolling<00:06:38.010> around<00:06:38.130> it<00:06:38.820> gets

once they start rolling around it gets

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.300 
once they start rolling around it gets
