00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.520
 because the state of the league is back 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.389
 your blockhouse and that's all again 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.929
 five minutes 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.869
 yes again on the topic of notes I was 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.759
 asked how it looks with the 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:25.009
 correctness of songbooks of bands though 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.520
 you just keep right original in 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:30.050
 Published songbooks I bought 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.410
 have here a star 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.170
 I'll try that on the 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.140
 what to do away with 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.870
 because that's it and here it is 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.989
 on how far you can do that now 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.789
 can be believed must want is 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.460
 on it old crying yes there you can already 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.589
 Let's go from now on in the cherry 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 lane verlag appeared that is one of 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.829
 many publishing houses light changes, there are still 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.330
 actually like me, relatively 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.460
 official songbooks make good little ones 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.040
 mistakes can always be found that can 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.020
 always be that the notes and the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.470
 temperature including any small ones 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.260
 So mistakes often include something 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.430
 This is often the case in songbooks 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.460
 for example, a note in the tabula tour 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.010
 So the notes above are correct and in 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.010
 the tabula tour and is a relative 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.890
 modest finger set so we can 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.840
 yes, for example, the note aa in the second 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.520
 grab on the b-side and that 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.740
 can be that ever since in there 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.460
 the tabla tour is that the same 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.380
 tone in the seventh fret on the b side 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.900
 that should be the same note 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.310
 and maybe the rest of the tabula 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.260
 Tour makes no sense at all because 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.730
 the rest just stops in the lower one 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.220
 position stop so there then stands 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.350
 Sometime a sound in the 7 and the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.120
 then no room would recognize that 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.530
 but then out of context so 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.180
 that's a mistake, stop it 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.269
 happen as the white comes 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.220
 Not me, but that can be 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.709
 that runs a bit contrary in the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.750
 Overall, I have to say mine 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.030
 Experience 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.930
 with official songbooks is actually 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.260
 so they are very good as well 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.620
 The basis for learning songs is the tipi 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.200
 tobey so you always have 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.490
 a very good starting position for 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.810
 after all, the summer is also the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.820
 moods in there that is natural 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.830
 relatively difficult because you do not know 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.600
 what the mood is played 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.910
 that sometimes maybe very big 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.130
 aha effect there when a song in one 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 very special mood was played 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.850
 he does not like the standard 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.040
 Standard tuning is in season 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.560
 Of course, everything is always there and that 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.930
 hardy also has the text 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.150
 and yes weird tactics so 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.010
 rhythmically, most songs are shoved 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.060
 always very good so i have to say now 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.739
 whether that kind of proof or something 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.700
 if that is so now they will be this 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.200
 songbooks are not always from me 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.820
 Since then he is in the case of the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.840
 guitarists written because not everyone 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.280
 guitarist also has the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.640
 ability to write only to our on 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.530
 can 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.450
 So maybe it can somehow 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.680
 Check it out with one 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 what else do I know how it works? 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.850
 comes about as such songbooks 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.769
 may be sent too 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.880
 just people and hear that out so 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.860
 Songbooks I can only ever return 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.739
 say songbooks are of course still 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.660
 relatively expensive but song that you get 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.489
 also very good on the ebay 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.860
 I keep saying and saying 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.010
 It is not a risk park at all 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.290
 learn homburg songbook learn songs 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.299
 super cool thing so that's for 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.489
 and you have just highlight one has 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.220
 official grades and it is always the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.560
 notes from the studio album exactly 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.500
 As I have this here you have the song now 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.660
 Books are always songbooks from the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.940
 however old that is all that different 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.829
 I only have a fence or something but there 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.420
 is because every number in it and that is 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.709
 Of course, simply awesome then worth it 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.510
 that too a few marks for go out 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.329
 if you really have official 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.530
 sheet material what annoys me the only one 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.720
 which maybe a bit 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.070
 I do not know if that works but me 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.370
 imagine that that's 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.470
 there are official songbooks in 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.160
 a year abo file format 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.990
 can buy 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.470
 if that is possible as the publishers are there 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.470
 it at least 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.590
 checked kita pro-version I have 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.290
 now or my comments already 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.940
 So that's what it looks like 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.230
 at least that's my tip 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.230
 Songbooks are always great
