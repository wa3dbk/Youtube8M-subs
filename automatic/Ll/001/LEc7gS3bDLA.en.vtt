00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.000
 haye now had a quick review of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 me and for this product her that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.509
 is at the new mascara I am now 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.549
 all over a longer period of time 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.789
 That's the maybelline I tested 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 jade roccat tm express mascara and me 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 Just want to say something like me 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.980
 she thinks why the order with it is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.080
 and how I find the result 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 and yes, if you are interested and you 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 maybe you are interested in this 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.260
 mascara or general new needed 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.690
 a new search then stay tuned 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.360
 very short was to the mascara and to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.610
 my eyelashes are so general I have 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820
 bought me in rossmann before now believe 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.960
 I a month or two something 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.969
 in between and clears your eyes tastes 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 995 and that's the water pro variant 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.329
 i have of rocket sometimes even 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 the normal mascara tried so the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.760
 not waterproof and wanted now 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.620
 Just this one again 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 Try it because I have a lot of good ones 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 belonged and as I said the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.879
 i bought myself from rossmann 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 it is actually well-stocked 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.270
 maybelline stand 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 because he gets them virtually anywhere, 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 especially now, of course 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 Extremely fast, just a lot of volume 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 conjure 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.270
 my lips are relatively bright that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.710
 I do not like it that way 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 good but I'm just a fair skin type 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 and that's why I'm pretty 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.790
 bright eyelashes 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 that's why my mascara has to be right 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.270
 Be nice black assistant man 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.189
 actually not too short and not 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 too long is actually looking for such a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 normal length they could of course 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.470
 be a little bit longer 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.930
 That's why I always look for a mascara 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.299
 which lends my eyelash length but 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.799
 also momentum and above all that is one 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.570
 This is a bit full of simplicity 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.180
 a bit of a minister of the ministry and a poet 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.070
 work and that's why I have you easy 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.259
 times tried a big difference 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.060
 the waterproof version to the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920
 normal 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.570
 old hat is that you the swing the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 In any case, it lends a lot 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.579
 better holds the normal mascara 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.689
 I would recommend to anyone 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.460
 actually that does not smudge either 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.659
 or something that smears the water 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.030
 Of course not at all 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.880
 normal in itself not if you 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 not totally oily skin and oily 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.140
 eyelids has got it then 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.050
 Also great with the normal thing cara 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.150
 but that just does not lend so much 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.450
 can jump to by pass the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.519
 mascara I like it here from the order 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.720
 she has me so big 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.190
 This is always relative to me 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.380
 important i can with as big as 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.000
 Sausages somehow I bypass them 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.650
 extends towards the front so a bit 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.870
 but thinner is in itself a whole 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 normal brush actually what she has 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.650
 she just has very short bristles 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
 thereby sticking and simply stays 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.400
 not so much mascara in the bristles 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.440
 hang that I think is quite good forward 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.580
 it's a bit rounded so that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.380
 brush suits me really 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.450
 in any case, even the color 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.310
 it is very nice black and it is from 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.319
 order rather on the dry side 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.489
 so it's not so wet what I am too 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.630
 always find a better view of the packaging 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.390
 I think the blue is okay 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.040
 actually quite cool and from the order 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.609
 I like her pretty much, too 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.319
 Well, I need that for a relatively long time 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.569
 I need a something Karas order 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.579
 long so I am very picky 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.920
 As far as my eyelashes are concerned, I have to 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.049
 say I make two layers once 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 after the first layer that I hide 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.850
 Now you see that now 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.280
 Well, I think you can see that 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.470
 Not so much in terms of volume 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.450
 Is she separating the eyelashes at the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.359
 first layer I think quite well and 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.650
 is already such a light swing and 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.019
 just a little bit longer 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.400
 but I would not say that 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.350
 result absolutely satisfied for me 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.120
 ask but if I still times 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.340
 go over it after the second order 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
 I think is a really blatant 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.569
 to see difference as if I did not 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.960
 mascara carries the right amount of volume 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.910
 because if you put them in one 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.530
 somehow denser and like that 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.180
 me really good because my eyelashes just 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.000
 I'm not that full of myself 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.250
 have rather thin diverging 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.080
 Eyelash pattern of course, watch this 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.940
 It's not that easy then 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 it does not get lumpy right away 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.240
 waterproof mascara in general I think 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.450
 always such a problem by that 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.660
 they are very dry then it will be 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.820
 also fast so fly legs moderately and 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.260
 but clumps in two layers 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.640
 I get there really well 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.130
 clear at the third layer then becomes 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.810
 already more critical then arise 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.760
 Super lump I think that's not 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.350
 more so nice but by that she 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.480
 It is just as dry that keeps you dry 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.590
 All day kept the swing easy 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.110
 really great 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.760
 my eyelashes stand all day long 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.100
 just up what I did before 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.720
 really no mascara had if 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.250
 I apply it then I'm so im 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.520
 Maybe a few of you run the day 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.200
 so crumb under my eyes though 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.820
 otherwise it smears at all 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.170
 not by being just as dry 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.300
 is falling as well as a few crumbs 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.580
 Sometimes I do not think so 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.620
 continues bad and is actually almost 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.600
 she is up at every mascara sonsten 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.520
 In any case, what oily skin where 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.460
 then more times it looks more like mau 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.040
 a panda will run the day this is 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.290
 with not at least as 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.240
 just not there for me 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.190
 it does not smudge anything I would you 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.710
 definitely recommend the mascara 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.030
 if you also want to have a lot of volume 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.770
 and also wanted to have longer over the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.810
 if you already have it all day 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.340
 have relatively dense and full eyelashes 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.450
 and you from alaska was actually too 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.220
 that they only a little bit 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.390
 definition get or synonymous 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.950
 to be separated a bit 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.050
 maybe that's not something 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.700
 for you, the mascara will be on everyone 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.250
 In case those really feel 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.600
 perhaps they also want volume 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.520
 so a bit on these fly my 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.560
 look like that some like me too 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.180
 Personally not really that 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.800
 is just so in the frame of me 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.170
 say okay they look really tight and 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.780
 full but not so fly 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.090
 legs clumped like from the 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.620
 so that the mascara really roccat 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.160
 great find synonymous if the order 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.230
 is a bit harder 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.730
 maybe with other mascara and wanda 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.150
 it must not be that way 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.830
 jammed but in itself I find that 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.660
 end result just so nice that me 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.500
 the slightly longer time just like in 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.810
 buy take 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.640
 but now it has fallen in the year 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.170
 I hope you enjoyed the riege 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.400
 Also as I filmed you the order 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.320
 I hope it's over pretty well 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.940
 Come that one with me in any case 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.980
 a difference in big difference 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.840
 otherwise it fits today 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.220
 with my short review and we see 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.220
 on wednesday we're fine again
