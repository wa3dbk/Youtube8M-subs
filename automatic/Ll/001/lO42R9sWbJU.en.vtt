00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 there is not two sizes as india state that see paler he is also one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.959

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.390
 flushing urine 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.650
 embraced dwm 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.650
 and he is a complex good blood 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.999
 This barbecue has a heat shield always handy for when you are on the 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.309
 barbecue and that is of course not too hot for the we still have at the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.219
 cover then have a per moments are good to know which 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.610
 Temperature Jane then go 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.780
 on the other hand, looking forward, cyrus is a chimney 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 year on time definitive blood then it goes so on the less quickly you want 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.270
 less warm inside and at moments of the alps set jelle gates the air there 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.650
 faster through it and it becomes the cracks and ground everything is ok much faster 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.740
 And the temperature measurement is handy that you can buy indirectly at most 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.290
 people who cook 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.650
 stop this gentleman and so that you always buy 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.880
 your meat is busy the moment you call on the place so a must 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 species of this although the herds themselves also determine 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.159
 how hard it is going to work 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.560
 i would do a bit 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.030
 a quarter put this you watch the temperature and so you can 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.670
 meat too 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.040
 grab it well 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.910
 and when you meet a barbecue and workout you have to cover the lid 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.980
 the side man is namely a hook or 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.420
 that can be a hit on the barbecue so you should not go anywhere else 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.420
 lost 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.440
 culemborg rÃ¶mer east with two handle always different marius 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.880
 to recover if you did not add up 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.320
 the winning team he worked separation we are 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.280
 say xd 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.990
 yes so if you would like to buy indirect choice anywhere drop to blaze room 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.070
 and that has always made it easier for me to walk on the side this weekend 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.260
 do with put cup of tournament in it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.400
 I look ff what criminals can you here on the side both briquettes do that 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.190
 is indirect 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.629
 but then they are immediately threatened everywhere 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.180
 then the briquettes grate gasoline sides that you sort of like 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.019
 rooms made orange so briquettes 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.549
 lose sight of to one in the barbecue well they call that a long time 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.859
 because silent is not on then you see immediately in a lot of air and also 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.019
 moment you give a couple of air that has suggested jotting outside then yes 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.749
 so he will no longer get the chimney effect and there will be 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.549
 so really on a lot better 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.420
 also too 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.800
 and immediately in the holes or for the cas 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 what one falls down on has 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:48.359
 seedorf lille also has 3 the chrome potiron days, 2 of them with the arts 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.559
 and that will put the tired barbecue in the shed that is possible 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.459
 very easy 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.700
 on the spot and on this chemical researcher sooner 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.459
 the summer entrants the outside gives weber 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.419
 if you no longer use this barbecue have another day affleck course of 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.169
 a life because in this way these young tourists stay completely tidy 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.760
 we still have a few weeks of heavy, heavy condition from the barbecue 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.289
 keep the spray and which we what your schedule 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.190
 and thus 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.969
 get blood drawn yes and have the wire brush 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.770
 year that makes you bad too 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.969
 the roast is clean and 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.099
 this barbecue team is also for the next year will be a catch 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.569
 ready to use and he continues to miss neat and clean
