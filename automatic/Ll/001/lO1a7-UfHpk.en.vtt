00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.190 

it's<00:01:59.940> not<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.450> straightforward<00:02:00.690> glass

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it's not just straightforward glass

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260

more new drum be ideas going around and
there's<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.150> general<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.960> groups<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.500> it

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
there's a general more like groups of it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.710 
there's a general more like groups of it
to<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> drum<00:02:08.520> side<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:08.940> album<00:02:09.060> yeah<00:02:09.509> we're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
to the drum side of the album yeah we're

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.270 
to the drum side of the album yeah we're
definitely<00:02:09.899> still<00:02:10.289> playing<00:02:10.500> fast<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.130> I

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
definitely still playing fast like I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
definitely still playing fast like I
think<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.610> fastest<00:02:12.030> song<00:02:12.240> it's<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.600> 260<00:02:13.440> 265

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
think I fastest song it's about 260 265

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.000 
think I fastest song it's about 260 265
but<00:02:14.970> we've<00:02:15.120> also<00:02:15.600> done<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> lot<00:02:16.170> slower<00:02:16.500> tempos

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
but we've also done a lot slower tempos

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.160 
but we've also done a lot slower tempos
and<00:02:17.340> there's<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.630> said<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.930> lot

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and there's just just like I said a lot

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:56.840 
and there's just just like I said a lot
more<00:02:19.350> diversity<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> actual<00:02:20.790> songwriting

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.040 

yeah<00:02:57.850> there's<00:02:58.060> definitely<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.480> big<00:02:58.690> difference

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
yeah there's definitely a big difference

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.720 
yeah there's definitely a big difference
complication<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.830> we<00:03:00.040> really<00:03:00.280> wanted<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.520> get

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
complication and we really wanted to get

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.570 
complication and we really wanted to get
away<00:03:00.910> from<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.300> like<00:03:01.660> over<00:03:02.080> triggered<00:03:02.580> really

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
away from the like over triggered really

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.910 
away from the like over triggered really
computerized<00:03:04.180> sounding<00:03:04.810> drums<00:03:05.110> with<00:03:05.830> this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
computerized sounding drums with this

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.530 
computerized sounding drums with this
album<00:03:06.190> everything's<00:03:06.700> natural

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
album everything's natural

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.840 
album everything's natural
everything's<00:03:08.080> obviously<00:03:08.410> played<00:03:08.620> by<00:03:08.830> me<00:03:09.070> and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
everything's obviously played by me and

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.640 
everything's obviously played by me and
there's<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.480> few<00:03:10.660> some<00:03:10.870> replacements<00:03:11.560> on

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
there's just a few some replacements on

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.010 
there's just a few some replacements on
the<00:03:11.740> top<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.160> where<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.460> needs<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.700> be<00:03:12.760> done<00:03:13.030> but

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
the top is where it needs to be done but

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.720 
the top is where it needs to be done but
yeah<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.380> wanted<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.010> make<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> lot<00:03:15.550> more

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
yeah we wanted to make it a lot more

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.880 
yeah we wanted to make it a lot more
natural<00:03:16.210> silent<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:17.380> took<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.590> lot<00:03:17.740> longer

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
natural silent so we took a lot longer

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.290 
natural silent so we took a lot longer
than<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.220> actual<00:03:18.340> takes<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> drumming

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
than the actual takes of the drumming

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.910 
than the actual takes of the drumming
I'm<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.110> make<00:03:20.260> sure<00:03:20.290> they're<00:03:20.560> absolutely

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
I'm just to make sure they're absolutely

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.790 
I'm just to make sure they're absolutely
perfect<00:03:20.980> precise<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.570> yes<00:03:22.810> if<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.230> haven't

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
perfect precise and yes if you haven't

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.070 
perfect precise and yes if you haven't
noticed
