there<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.079> even<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.829> smaller<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.670> that's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
there is even a smaller and so that's

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.490 
there is even a smaller and so that's
pretty<00:01:45.149> nice<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.659> here's<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> microphone

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
pretty nice and here's the microphone

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520 
pretty nice and here's the microphone
and<00:01:47.040> button<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.880> nice<00:01:48.509> golden<00:01:49.049> end<00:01:49.290> so

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and button for it nice golden end so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.440 
and button for it nice golden end so
that<00:01:49.710> should<00:01:49.950> last<00:01:50.100> long<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> good

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that should last long and have a good

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
that should last long and have a good
quality<00:01:52.220> then<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.549> two<00:01:53.790> micro<00:01:54.240> USB

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
quality then we have two micro USB

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.590 
quality then we have two micro USB
cables<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.649> probably<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.270> reason

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
cables that's probably one the reason

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.010 
cables that's probably one the reason
probably<00:01:57.750> why<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.530> because

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
probably why is because

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.859 
probably why is because
you<00:01:59.079> have<00:01:59.380> car<00:02:00.219> adapter<00:02:00.789> so<00:02:00.969> we<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.270> charge

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
you have car adapter so we can charge

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.499 
you have car adapter so we can charge
your<00:02:02.399> cell<00:02:03.399> phone<00:02:03.640> smartphone<00:02:04.119> even<00:02:04.329> in<00:02:04.420> the
