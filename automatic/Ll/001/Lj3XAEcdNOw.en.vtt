00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
Twitter but I guess that is something

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:31.550 
Twitter but I guess that is something
that<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.760> inevitable

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.590 

there<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> course<00:02:32.400> downside<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:33.480> of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
there is of course downside to all of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.690 
there is of course downside to all of
this<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.960> pioneer<00:02:34.950> hardware<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.490> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
this the pioneer hardware that the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
this the pioneer hardware that the
support<00:02:36.120> couplet<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.960> quite<00:02:37.230> expensive<00:02:37.620> at

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
support couplet is quite expensive at

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490 
support couplet is quite expensive at
caboose<00:02:38.220> 40,000<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.540> does<00:02:39.780> come<00:02:40.020> with<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.260> lot

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
caboose 40,000 but does come with a lot

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.140 
caboose 40,000 but does come with a lot
of<00:02:40.620> features<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:41.280> navigation<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> build

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
of features like navigation and build

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.000 
of features like navigation and build
what<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:42.990> do<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.380> about<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.770> hardware

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
what we do like about the hardware

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.190 
what we do like about the hardware
though<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.640> fact<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.660> very<00:02:45.930> clean

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
though is the fact that it is very clean

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.290 
though is the fact that it is very clean
and<00:02:46.230> minimalistic<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.940> carplay

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and minimalistic just like the carplay

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.360 
and minimalistic just like the carplay
that<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.570> supports<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.680> course<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.190> has<00:02:50.340> a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
that it supports and of course it has a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
that it supports and of course it has a

brilliant touch tree interface one of

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.410 
brilliant touch tree interface one of
