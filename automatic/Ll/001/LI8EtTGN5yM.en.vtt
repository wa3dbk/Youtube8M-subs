00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:08.532
 Life by Amazon 

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:15.155
 By the way, this table is amazing. Where did you get him? 

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:19.107
 I got it from Amazon Prime. Free shipping within two days. 

00:00:19.116 --> 00:00:21.738
 And from there you have this family? 

00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:24.975
 No, they don't have this on Amazon Prime. 

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:26.574
 I got from Rodinazon. 

00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:29.043
 So Amazon now sells whole families? 

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.143
 Yeah. 

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:32.388
 I've always wanted that. 

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.946
 Seriously, they really got better on Amazon. 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.257
 They sell everything. 

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:40.184
 Like what? 

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:42.710
 That's how Babizon is there. 

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.578
 I baked you cakes. 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.775
 Surely you would like Meaazon. 

00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:54.497
 Oh, and let's not forget Amazon Lime. 

00:00:56.353 --> 00:01:01.400
 You have to, but you really have to try the night delivery option 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.950
 on Chlapazone. 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.341
 It's a lot faster than going to the bar. 

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:15.565
 Wait, but what if they send you some bullshit. 

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.170
 Yes, sometimes they don't work, 

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.345
 but complaints are completely without problems. 

00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:23.244
 I don't have to leave the house for days. 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.147
 But you shouldn't live like this, what about fresh air? 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.129
 Fresh air is furnished. 

00:01:36.913 --> 00:01:39.147
 But what about real experiences? 

00:01:39.357 --> 00:01:41.953
 Mental and emotional satisfaction? 

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:46.394
 So they have the Amazon Tabernacle. 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.950
 And my biological clock is ticking 

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.950
 so I put three kids in the wish list at Miminazon. 

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:59.157
 I also dealt with the ill need of recognition from others 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.436
 thanks to Amazon - Existential crisis. 

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:06.488
 Did you have a relationship with your father? 

00:02:07.282 --> 00:02:08.733
 Oh my God. 

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.647
 He never told me that he liked me. 

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.271
 He never told me! 

00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:18.209
 Molly! 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.590
 All this is crazy! 

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:23.544
 Look, I understand when you go to Amazon instead of the store. 

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.336
 But you can't solve all the problems! 

00:02:25.356 --> 00:02:26.569
 Come on, Tori. 

00:02:26.603 --> 00:02:30.311
 I bet you have a problem that would solve the Amazon box. 

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:31.972
 So yeah. Listen. 

00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:34.285
 My boss, the dick, 

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:35.882
 recently caught my ass. 

00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:38.145
 And that was the last straw I want him to die. 

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:41.099
 I bet you have no box from Amazon to arrange it. 

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:44.829
 So this is Amazon Crime. 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.848
 Amazon Crime? 

00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.684
 Do you want a bounty hunter or a blackmailer? 

00:02:48.938 --> 00:02:50.163
 Are you serious? 

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:53.598
 This one has four stars, that's pretty decent. 

00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:56.138
 She specializes in defenestration. 

00:02:57.153 --> 00:02:58.786
 I had more in mind 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.757
 something like Lisbeth Salander, torture and stuff. 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.714
 You don't know peace, I like it. 

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:07.682
 - What about this one? - Done! 

00:03:16.637 --> 00:03:18.077
 Can I kill him? 

00:03:20.342 --> 00:03:21.170
 Okay. 

00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:26.632
 Oh my God. 

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:28.514
 Oh my God! 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.564
 And it's over! 

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:30.686
 I told you. 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.067
 Amazon Crime ... and you're a criminal. 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.131
 Hi, I have a shipment from Amazon Amazon. 

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:41.725
 Ku ***, I love Amazon! 

00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:44.274
 - Hi, I'm Mad. - And I Moni 

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:45.859
 We call ourselves MadMoni. 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.133

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:51.534
