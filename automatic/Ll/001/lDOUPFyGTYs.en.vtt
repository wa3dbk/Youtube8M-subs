Braveheart<00:03:59.040> I've<00:03:59.280> seen<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.579> like<00:03:59.700> 16<00:04:00.239> times

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
Braveheart I've seen it like 16 times

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.430 
Braveheart I've seen it like 16 times
and<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.870> still<00:04:01.079> hasn't<00:04:01.170> gotten<00:04:01.409> old<00:04:03.440> alright

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
and it still hasn't gotten old alright

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.979 
and it still hasn't gotten old alright
so<00:04:04.849> you<00:04:05.849> can<00:04:05.970> see<00:04:06.090> my<00:04:06.209> guys<00:04:06.389> are<00:04:06.540> holding<00:04:06.690> out

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
so you can see my guys are holding out

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.539 
so you can see my guys are holding out
and<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.440> surprising<00:04:07.889> thing<00:04:07.920> for<00:04:08.220> me<00:04:08.340> was<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
and the surprising thing for me was that

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.099 
and the surprising thing for me was that
they<00:04:08.819> weren't<00:04:09.000> routing<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.599> guess<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.930> didn't

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
they weren't routing I guess I didn't

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.080 
they weren't routing I guess I didn't
have<00:04:10.200> enough<00:04:10.409> forces<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:11.129> route<00:04:11.280> them<00:04:11.549> mainly

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
have enough forces to route them mainly

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.670 
have enough forces to route them mainly
my<00:04:12.359> nobles<00:04:12.780> were<00:04:12.900> still<00:04:13.139> there<00:04:13.170> but<00:04:13.500> they<00:04:13.650> are

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
my nobles were still there but they are

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.009 
my nobles were still there but they are
heavy<00:04:13.950> too<00:04:14.099> heavily<00:04:14.489> depleted<00:04:14.819> i<00:04:15.239> right<00:04:15.720> flank

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
heavy too heavily depleted i right flank

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.449 
heavy too heavily depleted i right flank
wall<00:04:16.229> Gottfried<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.799> I'm<00:04:17.010> gonna<00:04:17.190> start

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
wall Gottfried and I'm gonna start

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.069 
wall Gottfried and I'm gonna start
fucking<00:04:18.209> up<00:04:18.299> these<00:04:18.419> dudes<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.810> those<00:04:18.930> are

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
fucking up these dudes and those are

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.270 
fucking up these dudes and those are
cross<00:04:19.320> boom<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.739> I'm<00:04:19.769> surprised<00:04:20.160> they

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
cross boom and I'm surprised they

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.009 
cross boom and I'm surprised they
haven't<00:04:20.310> routed<00:04:20.880> yet<00:04:21.090> which<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.840> very

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
haven't routed yet which is very

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.960 
haven't routed yet which is very
surprising<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.620> me<00:04:22.740> I'm<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.639> can<00:04:23.760> see<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
surprising to me I'm you can see the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.730 
surprising to me I'm you can see the
available<00:04:24.300> troops<00:04:24.539> I<00:04:24.660> have<00:04:24.960> they've<00:04:25.349> been

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
available troops I have they've been

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.980 
available troops I have they've been
made<00:04:25.889> an<00:04:25.949> entire<00:04:26.250> circle<00:04:26.789> I<00:04:27.000> generalized

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
made an entire circle I generalized

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.990 
made an entire circle I generalized

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
slain upon the final field and the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.600 
slain upon the final field and the
cocksucker<00:04:30.449> kills<00:04:30.750> my<00:04:30.930> general<00:04:31.400> matter<00:04:32.400> where

cocksucker kills my general matter where

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
cocksucker kills my general matter where
I<00:04:32.639> get<00:04:32.940> his<00:04:33.090> at<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.389> end<00:04:33.800> I'm<00:04:34.800> at<00:04:34.949> least<00:04:35.630> it's

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
I get his at the end I'm at least it's

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.879 
I get his at the end I'm at least it's
right<00:04:36.780> now<00:04:36.900> I'm<00:04:36.960> sort<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.320> starting<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.650> panic

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
right now I'm sort of starting to panic

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.050 
right now I'm sort of starting to panic
for<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.250> fact<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.550> even<00:04:38.820> though<00:04:39.000> I'm

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
for the fact that even though I'm

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.969 
for the fact that even though I'm
winning<00:04:39.300> on<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.510> walls<00:04:39.780> all<00:04:40.199> my<00:04:40.680> all<00:04:40.949> my

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
winning on the walls all my all my

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.339 
winning on the walls all my all my
infantry<00:04:41.520> on<00:04:41.669> the<00:04:41.760> floor<00:04:42.000> or<00:04:42.150> dying<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:43.260> i'm

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
infantry on the floor or dying and i'm

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.439 
infantry on the floor or dying and i'm
just<00:04:43.470> focusing<00:04:43.889> my<00:04:44.039> archers<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.610> here<00:04:44.880> and

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
just focusing my archers in here and

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.480 
just focusing my archers in here and
there<00:04:46.229> and<00:04:46.380> see<00:04:46.620> this<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.889> what<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.070> mean<00:04:47.250> this

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
there and see this is what I mean this

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.430 
there and see this is what I mean this
the<00:04:47.970> mercenaries<00:04:48.630> could<00:04:48.810> really<00:04:49.050> hold<00:04:49.199> their

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
the mercenaries could really hold their

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.439 
the mercenaries could really hold their
own<00:04:49.470> which<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:49.830> very<00:04:50.130> surprising<00:04:50.610> in<00:04:51.030> this

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
own which is very surprising in this

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.089 
own which is very surprising in this
video<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.960> shows<00:04:51.990> how<00:04:52.349> good<00:04:52.410> they<00:04:52.770> could<00:04:52.919> hold

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
video it shows how good they could hold

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.100 
video it shows how good they could hold
their<00:04:53.220> own<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:54.030> guess<00:04:54.389> it<00:04:54.539> was<00:04:54.660> mainly<00:04:54.810> the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
their own and I guess it was mainly the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.439 
their own and I guess it was mainly the
commander<00:04:55.620> on<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.280> commander<00:04:56.849> gate<00:04:57.150> the

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
commander on the commander gate the

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.570 
commander on the commander gate the
commander<00:04:57.750> had<00:04:57.900> like<00:04:58.080> fucking<00:04:58.979> eight<00:04:59.220> stars

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
commander had like fucking eight stars

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.170 
commander had like fucking eight stars
so<00:05:00.030> his<00:05:00.930> morale<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:02.070> he<00:05:02.159> get<00:05:02.370> gave<00:05:02.639> off<00:05:02.849> and

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
so his morale that he get gave off and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.439 
so his morale that he get gave off and
the<00:05:03.270> charge<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.690> illness<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.169> shit<00:05:04.320> must<00:05:04.590> have

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
the charge of illness and shit must have

one I think it's a pretty decent battle

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.360 
one I think it's a pretty decent battle
