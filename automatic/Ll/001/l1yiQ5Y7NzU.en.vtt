having trouble because when I made that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.370 
having trouble because when I made that
video<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.970> actually<00:00:24.210> didn't<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> was

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
video I actually didn't know what I was

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.890 
video I actually didn't know what I was
doing<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.800> all<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.670> actually<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.970> scoby<00:00:27.390> not<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
doing at all it's actually a scoby not a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.859 
doing at all it's actually a scoby not a
Scooby<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.400> symbiotic<00:00:29.939> culture<00:00:30.480> of

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
Scooby it's a symbiotic culture of

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
Scooby it's a symbiotic culture of
bacteria<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.560> yeast<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> sounds

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
bacteria and yeast and I know it sounds

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.510 
bacteria and yeast and I know it sounds
gross<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.510> what<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> does<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.010> eats<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
gross but what it does is it eats the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.569 
gross but what it does is it eats the
sugar<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.809> makes<00:00:37.350> B<00:00:37.680> vitamins<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
sugar and it makes B vitamins with it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.240 
sugar and it makes B vitamins with it
which<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> good<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:40.350> some<00:00:40.559> better<00:00:40.860> tips

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
which is good so I have some better tips

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
which is good so I have some better tips
for<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:41.760> ok<00:00:42.750> first<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.350> used<00:00:43.680> brown

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
for you now ok first of all I used brown

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190 
for you now ok first of all I used brown
sugar<00:00:44.370> turns<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.690> better<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> use

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
sugar turns out that it's better to use

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
sugar turns out that it's better to use
white<00:00:46.440> sugar<00:00:46.469> well<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> brown<00:00:47.550> sugar<00:00:47.730> will

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
white sugar well the brown sugar will

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
white sugar well the brown sugar will
give<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.210> more<00:00:48.360> sediment<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> also<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.739> will

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
give you more sediment and also it will

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.200 
give you more sediment and also it will
have<00:00:50.250> fewer<00:00:51.059> d<00:00:51.719> vitamins<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> now<00:00:52.800> to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
have fewer d vitamins in it now to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.310 
have fewer d vitamins in it now to
regarding<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> proportions<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.140> other

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
regarding the proportions in my other

regarding the proportions in my other
video<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.010> used<00:00:56.280> three<00:00:56.670> cups<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.180> water<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.930> one

video I used three cups of water and one
cup<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> sugar<00:01:00.140> actually<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> use<00:01:01.649> more

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
cup of sugar actually you can use more

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
cup of sugar actually you can use more
water<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.309> found<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> brew<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.270> pretty

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690

you<00:04:02.659> but<00:04:02.900> seriously<00:04:03.829> I<00:04:04.329> wouldn't<00:04:05.329> believe

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
you but seriously I wouldn't believe

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.199 
you but seriously I wouldn't believe
that<00:04:05.859> it's<00:04:06.859> mostly<00:04:07.069> based<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.819> case<00:04:08.030> of

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
that it's mostly based on the case of

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.619 
that it's mostly based on the case of
two<00:04:08.510> women<00:04:09.169> in<00:04:09.290> Iowa<00:04:09.889> who<00:04:10.099> suddenly<00:04:10.400> died<00:04:10.879> they

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
two women in Iowa who suddenly died they

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.949 
two women in Iowa who suddenly died they
had<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:12.400> acidosis<00:04:13.400> like<00:04:13.819> their<00:04:14.000> ph<00:04:14.329> level<00:04:14.780> went

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
had a acidosis like their ph level went

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.620 
had a acidosis like their ph level went
acidic<00:04:15.699> actually<00:04:16.699> they<00:04:16.789> didn't<00:04:16.970> both<00:04:17.090> die<00:04:17.269> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
acidic actually they didn't both die the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.229 
acidic actually they didn't both die the
older<00:04:17.930> one<00:04:18.139> was<00:04:18.380> 58<00:04:18.889> she<00:04:19.070> died<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.969> other<00:04:20.000> one

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
older one was 58 she died the other one

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.430 
older one was 58 she died the other one
was<00:04:20.389> 48<00:04:20.900> and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
was 48 and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.770 
was 48 and
she<00:04:21.530> lived<00:04:21.830> it<00:04:22.460> turned<00:04:22.670> out<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.030> 58<00:04:23.570> year

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
she lived it turned out that the 58 year

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.950 
she lived it turned out that the 58 year
old<00:04:23.870> had<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.110> perforated<00:04:24.530> bowel<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.750> I'd<00:04:26.750> say

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
old had a perforated bowel so I'd say

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.300 
old had a perforated bowel so I'd say
that<00:04:27.140> probably<00:04:27.320> had<00:04:27.590> more<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.920> do<00:04:28.010> with<00:04:28.040> why

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
that probably had more to do with why

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.620 
that probably had more to do with why
she<00:04:28.490> died<00:04:28.670> then<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.060> fact<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.300> she<00:04:29.510> was

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
she died then the fact that she was

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.810 
she died then the fact that she was
drinking<00:04:29.810> kombucha<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.980> CDC<00:04:31.520> when<00:04:31.700> they

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
drinking kombucha the CDC when they

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.460 
drinking kombucha the CDC when they
investigated<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.600> case<00:04:32.750> with<00:04:32.960> two<00:04:33.170> women<00:04:33.410> in

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
investigated the case with two women in

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.800 
investigated the case with two women in
Iowa<00:04:33.890> they<00:04:34.640> never<00:04:34.790> actually<00:04:35.030> tested<00:04:35.660> their

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
Iowa they never actually tested their

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.270 
Iowa they never actually tested their
brew<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.170> see<00:04:36.350> if<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.530> was<00:04:36.590> contaminated<00:04:37.160> with

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
brew to see if it was contaminated with

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.470 
brew to see if it was contaminated with
anything<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.000> they<00:04:38.510> never<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:39.020> found<00:04:39.440> out

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
anything so they never really found out

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.730 
anything so they never really found out
what-what<00:04:41.480> exactly<00:04:41.870> killed<00:04:42.560> them<00:04:42.710> and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
what-what exactly killed them and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.100 
what-what exactly killed them and
whether<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.880> kombucha<00:04:44.240> was<00:04:44.450> connected<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.020> in

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
whether the kombucha was connected to in

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.490 
whether the kombucha was connected to in
any<00:04:45.290> way<00:04:45.380> when<00:04:46.280> they<00:04:46.430> looked<00:04:46.940> at<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.500> bacteria

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
any way when they looked at the bacteria

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.020 
any way when they looked at the bacteria
and<00:04:48.560> yeast<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.190> were<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.580> the<00:04:49.760> kombucha

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and yeast that were in the kombucha

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.090 
and yeast that were in the kombucha
cultures<00:04:50.480> those<00:04:50.960> are<00:04:51.140> some<00:04:51.350> other<00:04:51.590> ones<00:04:51.830> that

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
cultures those are some other ones that

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.940 
cultures those are some other ones that
they<00:04:52.220> had<00:04:52.310> analyzed<00:04:52.790> long<00:04:53.060> before<00:04:53.480> so<00:04:53.950> the

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
they had analyzed long before so the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.740 
they had analyzed long before so the
other<00:04:55.070> issue<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.670> would<00:04:55.940> be<00:04:56.060> contamination

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
other issue that would be contamination

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.770 
other issue that would be contamination
well<00:04:57.230> you<00:04:57.410> want<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.710> put<00:04:57.980> you<00:04:58.190> know<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:59.510> mesh

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
well you want to put you know the mesh

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600 
well you want to put you know the mesh
like<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.350> so<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.620> don't<00:05:00.830> have<00:05:00.950> bugs<00:05:01.310> and

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
like this so you don't have bugs and

whatever else mold falling in there but
you<00:05:04.550> know<00:05:04.580> there<00:05:05.480> are<00:05:05.600> some<00:05:05.780> you<00:05:06.140> know<00:05:06.170> rumors

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
you know there are some you know rumors

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.590 
you know there are some you know rumors

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
that it could get contaminated with

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.200 
that it could get contaminated with
anthrax<00:05:09.350> but<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.100> easy<00:05:10.310> way<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:10.730> prevent

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
anthrax but the easy way to prevent

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.170 
anthrax but the easy way to prevent
anthrax<00:05:11.920> contamination<00:05:12.920> of<00:05:13.130> your<00:05:13.400> kombucha

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
anthrax contamination of your kombucha

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.510 
anthrax contamination of your kombucha
is<00:05:14.360> to<00:05:14.630> just<00:05:14.810> keep<00:05:15.080> anthrax<00:05:15.740> infected<00:05:16.310> cows

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
is to just keep anthrax infected cows

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520 
is to just keep anthrax infected cows
out<00:05:16.730> of<00:05:16.880> your<00:05:16.970> kitchen<00:05:17.120> it's<00:05:18.020> really<00:05:18.350> that

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
out of your kitchen it's really that

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.250 
out of your kitchen it's really that
simple<00:05:18.560> oh<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:20.000> kombucha<00:05:20.810> does<00:05:21.020> have<00:05:21.230> a

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
simple oh and kombucha does have a

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.660 
simple oh and kombucha does have a
little<00:05:21.500> bit<00:05:21.650> of<00:05:21.680> alcohol<00:05:21.920> in<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.400> but<00:05:22.520> it's

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
little bit of alcohol in it but it's

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.240 
little bit of alcohol in it but it's
like<00:05:22.910> it's<00:05:23.390> supposed<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.810> be<00:05:23.930> about<00:05:24.080> 0.5%<00:05:24.590> but

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
like it's supposed to be about 0.5% but

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.200 
like it's supposed to be about 0.5% but
if<00:05:25.340> you're<00:05:25.460> brewing<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.760> at<00:05:25.820> home<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.060> don't

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
if you're brewing it at home you don't

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.730 
if you're brewing it at home you don't
really<00:05:26.390> know<00:05:26.630> exactly<00:05:26.720> how<00:05:27.200> much<00:05:27.320> alcohol<00:05:27.500> is

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
really know exactly how much alcohol is

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.920 
really know exactly how much alcohol is
in<00:05:27.919> there<00:05:28.100> so<00:05:28.310> i<00:05:28.550> probably<00:05:29.330> wouldn't<00:05:29.660> give<00:05:29.810> it

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
in there so i probably wouldn't give it

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.409 
in there so i probably wouldn't give it
to<00:05:29.960> kids<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.620> know<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:31.700> they<00:05:31.820> sell<00:05:32.180> this<00:05:32.300> in

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
to kids you know so they sell this in

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.970 
to kids you know so they sell this in
the<00:05:32.510> store<00:05:32.750> it's<00:05:33.110> like<00:05:33.260> six<00:05:33.500> ounces<00:05:33.830> of
