 State Farm and the legendary laborer 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.759
 him 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.280
 mts-82 philistine, he is better known under 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 the name of Belarus does not mean that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.359
 this tractor is 10 years old and the thing is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.140
 what is agricultural machinery 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.060
 Much more durable than cars 2 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.580
 how can you be short-lived with such 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
 thick metal besides 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 agricultural equipment for salted 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.059
 the streets don't drive in traffic jams don't stand up to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 the ecology is all right with the tractor 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.719
 direct diesel engine 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.260

 one horsepower all wheel drive and 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.680
 self-locking rear differential 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.300
 Well, now look at the cabin situation 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.280
 no Spartan here for you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.680
 armrests with cup holders even 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
 will explain not to mention the air conditioner 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 only eighty second year after 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.460
 modernization of the cab is sealed and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.400
 the air began to flow into it through 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 filters dustproof but this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.260
 one of the first Soviet tractors on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.260
 which instead of the launcher installed 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 electric starter 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.430

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.890
 driver and the steering column can 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.080
 change the height and recline at the entrance and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.570
 out of the cab ordinary working 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.580
 the situation you can move on the tractor with 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.520
 any transmission but novice is not easy 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.050
 choose which one you need because they are 9 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.480
 forward and 2 back 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 Immediately touch 7 speed preset 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.700
 there is only one shock absorber 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.619
 driver's seat 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.920
 how many motorists should say 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.630
 thanks to this all-wheel drive tractor 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.020
 Belarus helped to pull out of impassable 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 dirt is not a single car for 34 years that its 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.700
 release mts-82 received eight gold

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.479
 international state test center 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 Nebraska in the United States can boast 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.410
 this is our auto industry 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.750
 apparently the quality was influenced by our genes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.209
 tanks close relatives of tractors 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.569

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.470
 enough to spend a couple of hours behind the wheel 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.630
 this machine to understand the work 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.760
 the tractor driver is still heavy 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.760
