that<00:05:13.740> cave<00:05:13.980> crawler

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
that cave crawler

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.070 
that cave crawler
tusk<00:05:14.670> that<00:05:14.790> I<00:05:14.850> had<00:05:14.970> a<00:05:15.000> long<00:05:15.210> time<00:05:15.390> ago<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.810> don't

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
tusk that I had a long time ago I don't

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.930 
tusk that I had a long time ago I don't
know<00:05:16.170> how<00:05:16.320> off<00:05:16.470> coping<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.310> but<00:05:17.460> now<00:05:17.580> my<00:05:17.700> stuffs

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
know how off coping it but now my stuffs

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.490 
know how off coping it but now my stuffs
are<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> lot<00:05:18.420> higher<00:05:18.600> than<00:05:18.630> before<00:05:19.050> so

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
are a lot higher than before so

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.050 
are a lot higher than before so
hopefully<00:05:19.830> I<00:05:19.890> should<00:05:20.130> hit<00:05:20.310> a<00:05:20.370> bit<00:05:20.580> better

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
hopefully I should hit a bit better

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.580 
hopefully I should hit a bit better
if<00:05:21.210> not<00:05:21.720> I'll<00:05:21.840> probably<00:05:21.990> just<00:05:22.200> trying<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.440> keep

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
if not I'll probably just trying to keep

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.960 
if not I'll probably just trying to keep
the<00:05:22.710> task<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.160> then<00:05:23.250> go<00:05:23.370> from<00:05:23.490> there<00:05:23.640> but<00:05:23.790> if<00:05:23.880> I

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
the task and then go from there but if I

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.490 
the task and then go from there but if I
can<00:05:24.180> actually<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.660> cave<00:05:24.840> crawl<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.170> task<00:05:25.380> I

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
can actually to cave crawl the task I

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.200 
can actually to cave crawl the task I
will<00:05:25.560> try<00:05:25.890> my<00:05:26.010> best<00:05:26.040> to<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:26.760> depends<00:05:27.090> how

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
will try my best to it just depends how

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.210

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
know he's good one to prove a point now

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.830 
know he's good one to prove a point now
if<00:05:32.820> it<00:05:33.030> can<00:05:33.150> let<00:05:33.270> me<00:05:33.360> first

there wasn't that much progress today
but<00:07:49.170> as<00:07:49.290> long<00:07:49.410> as<00:07:49.470> I<00:07:49.560> got<00:07:49.710> the<00:07:49.800> quests<00:07:50.100> on<00:07:50.220> that

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340 
but as long as I got the quests on that

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.770 
but as long as I got the quests on that
I<00:07:50.370> needed<00:07:50.610> to<00:07:50.700> do<00:07:50.850> I'm<00:07:51.000> rather<00:07:51.180> happy<00:07:51.360> with<00:07:51.570> it

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.770 
I think the main one would be the

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.380 
I think the main one would be the
fiftieth<00:07:53.130> tackling<00:07:53.580> with<00:07:53.670> the<00:07:53.790> offhand<00:07:54.150> whip

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:54.390 
fiftieth tackling with the offhand whip

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.610 
fiftieth tackling with the offhand whip
