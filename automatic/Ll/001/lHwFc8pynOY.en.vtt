yeah<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> color<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.060 
yeah I do like the color if I want it to
make<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.830> pastel<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:22.070> add

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
make it pastel I will just add

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.179 
make it pastel I will just add
conditioner<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.900> make<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.110> pastel

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.980 

rinsing<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.460> was<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.659> nice

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
rinsing it out was actually very nice

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.240 
rinsing it out was actually very nice
because<00:01:31.610> blue<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.939> tend<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> bleed<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.659> lot

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because blue is to tend to bleed a lot

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.080 
because blue is to tend to bleed a lot
so<00:01:36.530> rinsing<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.890> pretty<00:01:38.100> good<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.670> water

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so rinsing it was pretty good the water

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.179 
so rinsing it was pretty good the water
did<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.780> pretty<00:01:39.990> clear<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> color<00:01:43.409> itself<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
did get pretty clear the color itself is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.600 
did get pretty clear the color itself is
it's<00:01:44.430> very<00:01:44.700> rich<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:45.840> dense<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it's very rich it's very dense so it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's very rich it's very dense so it
doesn't<00:01:47.880> spread<00:01:48.180> very<00:01:48.360> easily<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.700> use

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
doesn't spread very easily so I did use

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.959 
doesn't spread very easily so I did use
