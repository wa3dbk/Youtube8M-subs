00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.020
 hello friends how are you welcome another 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.759
 video and well good friends how can 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 observe in the video today we will see a 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.939
 new video of how to know how many bits 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.679
 have my windows pc for windows vista and 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.399
 windows xp then well what are we going to 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:54.299
 First of all, it's very simple to 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.000
 because of course there are no programs nor 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.420
 nothing like that as they say in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.320
 some and well then let's start 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.229
 first thing is your start 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.900
 then what we are going to do is go to 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.660
 all the programs below and we 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.240
 let's go to there are two folders that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.630
 they say accessories will have to find 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.520
 the one with the most files this 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.840
 because in accessories comes only one 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.420
 folder in a folder and it comes this are 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.010
 system tools and they come for 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.370
 I come internet explorer I do not know if 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.990
 someone else have this but good we 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.180
 let's go to the correct folder that would be 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:42.970
 this accessories and we go to where it says 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.720
 System tools 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.480
 and we go to the system information 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.590
 we click 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.590
 and we hope 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.130
 very good here is the picture and good 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.319
 we are going to load it is updated and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.689
 it's updated 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.519
 then as you can see in these two 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:12.209
 parts here says system type and 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:17.579
 processor when it is in 86 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.810
 these numbers x86 x86 means that 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:25.730
 have we have 32 bits if you have 64 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.480
 it means that they are 64 bits 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.519
 this 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.860
 I do not understand why this is true but 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:40.340
 good that means 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:44.930
 86 32 bits and 64 64 bits and then here is 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.719
 as you can see and well 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.260
 then we can close it and then 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.260
 we will know 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.930
 how many bits do we have in our pc 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.220
 I say that maybe it 's the same 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:07.910
 not me that the same in both windows xp or 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:10.850
 view to a windows 89 because then I think 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.200
 which is the same not without new I'm wrong 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:19.040
 it's the same do not be different because you do not 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.130
 I know but I have the idea that 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.350
 the same procedure or 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.910
 like some that she 20 like some 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.350
 that you laptops do not have the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.530
 run an example has the run 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.160
 at the beginning they have to put him or not 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.450
 confused because he says about three tell them 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.060
 we go to my pc and then one another 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.750
 computers do not have this they do not have 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.569
 this to my pc but the team says team 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.409
 instead of fish my pc 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:05:00.259
 and then then that is the problem 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:03.919
 true but then I do not know maybe it's 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:06.649
 another procedure says that to that area 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.669
 different is to say I do not know if he himself 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:12.439
 but good anyway and well good friends 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.990
 this has been all I hope that I have 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:17.779
 liked the video if you liked it like 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:24.099
