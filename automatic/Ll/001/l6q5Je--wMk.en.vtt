00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
to say before you do it you have to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.210 
to say before you do it you have to
check<00:01:28.920> them<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.490> market<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.799> value<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the players because all the websites

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
of players are definitely wrong at the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.749 
of players are definitely wrong at the
moment<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.100> use<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> web<00:01:38.520> app<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
moment because they use a web app to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.390 
moment because they use a web app to
kind<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:38.970> gauge<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.869> prices<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
kind of gauge on the prices so that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
kind of gauge on the prices so that
inaccurate<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> moment<00:01:42.390> unless<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.869> know

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
inaccurate at the moment unless you know

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
inaccurate at the moment unless you know
one<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.409> she<00:01:43.649> does<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> console<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
one that she does it by the console I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.310 
one that she does it by the console I
don't<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> console

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
don't think you can do it on the console

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.340 
don't think you can do it on the console
then<00:01:46.829> only<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:47.759> off<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.840> example

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
then only take off that but for example

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.370 
then only take off that but for example

prices<00:02:03.420> before<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.780> actually<00:02:03.899> go<00:02:04.110> ahead<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
prices before you actually go ahead and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.499 
prices before you actually go ahead and
pick<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> plan<00:02:05.399> from<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.909> minute<00:02:06.119> method

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
pick up the plan from that minute method

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.760 
pick up the plan from that minute method
if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.960> don't<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.350> 59th<00:02:07.740> minute

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
if you don't know what the 59th minute

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.980 
if you don't know what the 59th minute
method<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.940> basically<00:02:09.209> where<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
method is it's basically where you

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.710 
method is it's basically where you
the<00:02:10.230> 59th<00:02:10.620> minute<00:02:10.680> wait<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.240> deals<00:02:12.570> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the 59th minute wait there for deals to

the 59th minute wait there for deals to
be<00:02:12.750> put<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.350> because<00:02:13.710> one<00:02:14.040> hour<00:02:14.250> listing

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
be put on that because one hour listing

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.730 
be put on that because one hour listing
time<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.570> most<00:02:15.720> popular<00:02:16.230> listing<00:02:16.530> time

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
time is the most popular listing time

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.830 
time is the most popular listing time

for players to be partners the transfer

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
for players to be partners the transfer
market<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.800> any<00:02:20.100> players<00:02:20.730> which

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
seconds after about I would say it could

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.970

be<00:03:25.610> put<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:26.820> ten<00:03:27.780> minutes<00:03:27.930> I'd<00:03:28.320> say<00:03:28.560> so

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
be put it about ten minutes I'd say so

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.500

obviously<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.820> something<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.390> do

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
obviously this is something that you do

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.120 
obviously this is something that you do
whilst<00:03:30.810> you're<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.290> know<00:03:31.410> on<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> computer

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
whilst you're you know on the computer

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.370 
whilst you're you know on the computer
or<00:03:32.400> something<00:03:32.580> else<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.870> isn't<00:03:34.170> something

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
or something else this isn't something

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.210 
or something else this isn't something
that<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.650> would<00:03:34.860> do<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.880> know<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.390> by<00:03:36.600> luck

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
that you would do you know just by luck

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.500 
that you would do you know just by luck
basically<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:38.460> an<00:03:38.550> easier<00:03:38.880> way<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.060> doing<00:03:39.420> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
basically it's an easier way of doing it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.060 
basically it's an easier way of doing it
than<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:39.750> doing<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.290> yourself<00:03:40.380> manually

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070
