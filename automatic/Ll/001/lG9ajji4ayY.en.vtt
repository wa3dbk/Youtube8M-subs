00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
a little bit of research there's no

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.720 
a little bit of research there's no
arrow<00:03:40.380> keys<00:03:40.800> telling<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.130> where<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.400> for

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.850 
arrow keys telling you where to go for
quests<00:03:42.270> so<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.230> actually<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.710> figure

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.300 
quests so you do actually have to figure
out<00:03:44.040> kind<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.280> what<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.550> doing<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:47.100> looks

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
out kind of what you're doing it looks

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.160 
out kind of what you're doing it looks
like<00:03:47.430> oh<00:03:47.550> oh<00:03:47.790> oh<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.300> thought<00:03:48.630> I'd<00:03:48.810> cleared<00:03:49.080> the
