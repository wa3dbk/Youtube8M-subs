because it's a rare sight of 20 of these
babies<00:00:29.480> if<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> would<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.840> asked<00:00:31.170> me<00:00:31.289> five

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
babies if it would have asked me five

on<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.350> only<00:00:37.500> possible

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
on and I think there was only possible

because only the best rates engineered
engineered<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.350> car<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.010> everybody<00:00:41.670> has

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
engineered that car and everybody has

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
right the most stunning figures we make

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
right the most stunning figures we make
with<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> car<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> 718<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> notch<00:00:59.730> level

with the car is a 718 and a notch level

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:36.430 
with the car is a 718 and a notch level
because<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> absolute

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.040 

it<00:01:37.280> was<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.490> very<00:01:37.580> long<00:01:38.060> project<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.840> in<00:01:38.960> that

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
it was a very long project and in that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.080 
it was a very long project and in that
unexpected<00:01:39.770> one<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.400> wasn't<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.790> sales

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
unexpected one because it wasn't a sales

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.670 
unexpected one because it wasn't a sales
trip<00:01:41.330> abroad<00:01:41.660> trip<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.140> was<00:01:42.170> more<00:01:42.470> like<00:01:42.650> a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
trip abroad trip it was more like a

this<00:02:12.220> project<00:02:12.670> was<00:02:12.790> born<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:13.600> took<00:02:13.840> all<00:02:14.050> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
this project was born we took all the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.410 
this project was born we took all the
weight<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.650> could<00:02:14.830> find<00:02:15.100> out<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.580> normal<00:02:15.790> gt2

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
weight we could find out of a normal gt2

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.740 
weight we could find out of a normal gt2
and<00:02:16.690> put<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:17.800> carbon<00:02:18.640> fiber<00:02:18.880> parts<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
and put in carbon fiber parts and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.140 
and put in carbon fiber parts and
without<00:02:20.650> taking<00:02:21.130> too<00:02:21.250> much<00:02:21.400> consideration

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
and care about the feasibility for our

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.620 
and care about the feasibility for our
future<00:02:24.100> product<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:24.910> we<00:02:25.060> wanted<00:02:25.270> to<00:02:25.420> learn

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
future product what we wanted to learn

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.580 
future product what we wanted to learn
is<00:02:26.170> how<00:02:26.230> does<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.620> GT<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.370> feel<00:02:28.270> when<00:02:28.990> it's<00:02:29.020> maxed

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
is how does a GT to feel when it's maxed

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.550 
is how does a GT to feel when it's maxed
out<00:02:29.740> regarding<00:02:30.280> weight<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.760> power<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.560> when

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
out regarding weight and power and when

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.960 
out regarding weight and power and when
we<00:02:32.680> went<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> knowledge<00:02:33.310> level<00:02:33.580> with<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
we went to the knowledge level with the
