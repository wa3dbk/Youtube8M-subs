workflow that's right we can actually to
pologize<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.990> actually<00:00:25.439> build<00:00:26.070> up<00:00:26.250> base

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
pologize we can actually build up base

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.670 
pologize we can actually build up base
meshes<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:27.930> topology<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.470> don't

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
meshes that have good topology we don't

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
meshes that have good topology we don't
have<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.039> outside<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.460> other<00:00:30.300> programs

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
have to go outside to other programs

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.900 
have to go outside to other programs
anymore<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.830> something<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.820> go

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
anymore to get something that we can go

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.220 
anymore to get something that we can go
ahead<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.210> start<00:00:33.390> rigging<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> start

a lot of the standard tools especially

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.630 
a lot of the standard tools especially
something<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> wax<00:00:46.200> tool<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:47.399> all

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
something like the wax tool and with all

what<00:00:51.030> he'd<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> use<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> his

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
what he'd like to use is it one of his

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.290 
what he'd like to use is it one of his
base<00:00:52.350> brushes<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.300> specifically

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
base brushes all the time specifically

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.260 
base brushes all the time specifically
created<00:00:54.780> clay<00:00:55.170> brush<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.680> ZBrush<00:00:56.160> um<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
created clay brush in ZBrush um so it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
created clay brush in ZBrush um so it
was<00:00:57.719> kind<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.960> neat<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.379> somebody<00:00:59.100> who

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
was kind of neat to see somebody who

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.920 
was kind of neat to see somebody who
really<00:00:59.550> never<00:00:59.820> used<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> program<00:01:00.390> short<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
really never used the program short of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
really never used the program short of
maybe<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> dare<00:01:01.469> twos<00:01:01.739> worth<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> tutorials<00:01:02.460> go

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
maybe a dare twos worth of tutorials go

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
maybe a dare twos worth of tutorials go
through<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.229> kind<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> blow<00:01:04.530> us<00:01:04.650> away<00:01:04.710> with

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
through and kind of blow us away with

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
through and kind of blow us away with
how<00:01:05.159> fast<00:01:05.430> he's<00:01:05.670> able<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> adopt<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
how fast he's able to adopt the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.940 
how fast he's able to adopt the
sculpting<00:01:07.020> tools<00:01:07.200> which<00:01:07.350> personally<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> feel

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
sculpting tools which personally I feel

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
sculpting tools which personally I feel
like<00:01:08.130> haven't<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.700> been<00:01:09.000> explored<00:01:09.479> all

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
like haven't really been explored all

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.330 
like haven't really been explored all
that<00:01:09.780> much<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.170> most<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> us<00:01:10.830> who<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.040> used<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that much by most of us who are used to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.500 
that much by most of us who are used to
using<00:01:11.520> cinema<00:01:11.850> every<00:01:12.000> single<00:01:12.270> day<00:01:12.360> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
using cinema every single day it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.850 
using cinema every single day it's
actually<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> an<00:01:13.049> inspiration<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.650> see

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
actually kind of an inspiration to see

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
actually kind of an inspiration to see
somebody<00:01:14.340> who's<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> great<00:01:15.000> sculptor

somebody who's just a great sculptor
who's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:15.750> artist<00:01:16.110> adaptive<00:01:16.860> tools<00:01:17.009> he's

who's a great artist adaptive tools he's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.890 
who's a great artist adaptive tools he's
never<00:01:17.220> used<00:01:17.460> before<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:18.060> our<00:01:18.180> 16<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
never used before in our 16 we have a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
never used before in our 16 we have a
couple<00:01:19.170> new<00:01:19.350> features<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> coolest

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
couple new features one of the coolest

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.940 
couple new features one of the coolest
features<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> thought<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.229> may<00:01:22.409> slip<00:01:22.650> past

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
features that I thought it may slip past

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.140 
features that I thought it may slip past
a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> people<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> ability

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
a lot of people is we have the ability

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.390 
a lot of people is we have the ability
to<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.299> spline<00:01:24.689> snapping<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.380> our<00:01:25.799> sculpt<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to do spline snapping on our sculpt so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.690 
to do spline snapping on our sculpt so
if<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.240> drew<00:01:27.990> out<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.439> spline<00:01:29.310> say

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
if you actually drew out a spline say

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.740 
if you actually drew out a spline say
something<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.509> would<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.720> a
