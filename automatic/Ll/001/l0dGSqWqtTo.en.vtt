the way cities are run on a day-to-day

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.279 
the way cities are run on a day-to-day
basis<00:00:49.190> it's<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> wheel<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.079> tell<00:00:52.260> me

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
basis it's all in the wheel so tell me

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.470 
basis it's all in the wheel so tell me
why<00:00:52.590> did<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> decide<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> reinvent<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> wheel

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
why did you decide to reinvent the wheel

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
why did you decide to reinvent the wheel
we<00:00:55.260> started<00:00:55.530> looking<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:55.949> different<00:00:56.309> reasons

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
we started looking at different reasons

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
we started looking at different reasons
why<00:00:56.760> people<00:00:57.030> don't<00:00:57.329> cycle<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
why people don't cycle and one of the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.959 
why people don't cycle and one of the
things<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.620> came<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.430> people

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
things that came up with that people

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.340 
things that came up with that people
have<00:01:00.059> certain<00:01:00.300> limitations<00:01:00.329> whether<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
have certain limitations whether it be

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
have certain limitations whether it be
held<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.760> distance<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> travel

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
held or the distance they have to travel

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
held or the distance they have to travel
to<00:01:03.840> get<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> work<00:01:04.229> maybe<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> hill<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to get to work maybe it's up a hill and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
to get to work maybe it's up a hill and
so<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.030> started<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> think<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.540> how<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.810> we

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
so we started to think about how can we

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.050 
so we started to think about how can we
change<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.950> make<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> bike

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
change that and actually make a bike

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
change that and actually make a bike
more<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.049> available<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> everyone

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
more you know more available to everyone

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.700 
more you know more available to everyone
so<00:01:11.760> Jennifer<00:01:12.330> Dunham<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.840> her<00:01:12.930> team<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.350> MIT

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so Jennifer Dunham and her team at MIT

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.460 
so Jennifer Dunham and her team at MIT
senseable<00:01:14.369> City<00:01:14.939> lab<00:01:15.210> came<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.439> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
senseable City lab came up not with a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.980 
senseable City lab came up not with a
new<00:01:16.680> bike<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> new<00:01:17.610> wheel<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.479> turns<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
new bike but a new wheel that turns a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
new bike but a new wheel that turns a
bicycle<00:01:19.530> into<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.860> information-gathering

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
bicycle into an information-gathering

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.899 
bicycle into an information-gathering
powerhouse<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> actually<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.430> interesting

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
powerhouse so actually the interesting

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.609 
powerhouse so actually the interesting
thing<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.450> code<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> Copenhagen

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
thing about this code the Copenhagen

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.899 
thing about this code the Copenhagen
wheel<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.820> an

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
wheel is it's not actually just an

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
wheel is it's not actually just an
electric<00:01:27.270> bike<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.110> electric<00:01:28.530> hub

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
electric bike but it's an electric hub

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
electric bike but it's an electric hub
we're<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.490> giving<00:01:29.850> people<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
we're actually giving people the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
we're actually giving people the
potential<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.990> track<00:01:31.409> where<00:01:32.310> they're<00:01:32.490> cycling

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
potential to track where they're cycling

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
potential to track where they're cycling
in<00:01:32.909> cities<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.180> then<00:01:33.450> use<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.840> data<00:01:34.110> from

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
in cities and then use this data from

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
in cities and then use this data from
municipalities<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
municipalities so that we can make a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.149 
municipalities so that we can make a
very<00:01:36.840> clear<00:01:37.200> statement<00:01:37.290> about<00:01:37.829> how<00:01:38.009> many

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
very clear statement about how many

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
very clear statement about how many
people<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.549> traveling<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:39.119> bicycles<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> how

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
people are traveling on bicycles and how

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.749 
people are traveling on bicycles and how
many<00:01:40.229> people<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> travel<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.220> bicycles

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
many people want to travel on bicycles

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.550 
many people want to travel on bicycles
and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.509> city<00:01:42.810> municipalities<00:01:43.530> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
and then city municipalities can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
and then city municipalities can
actually<00:01:43.979> look<00:01:44.070> at<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.280> data<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:45.000> where

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
actually look at this data and see where

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
actually look at this data and see where
they<00:01:45.420> need<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.600> allocate<00:01:46.229> their<00:01:46.649> expenses<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
they need to allocate their expenses so

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.679 
they need to allocate their expenses so
that<00:01:47.490> maybe<00:01:47.610> bike<00:01:47.939> lanes<00:01:48.180> need<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that maybe bike lanes need to be in

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
that maybe bike lanes need to be in
places<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.200> hadn't<00:01:49.500> previously<00:01:49.649> thought<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
places they hadn't previously thought of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
places they hadn't previously thought of
so<00:01:50.820> you've<00:01:51.270> been<00:01:51.420> talking<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:52.590> bikes

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so you've been talking about these bikes

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.039 
so you've been talking about these bikes
collecting<00:01:53.610> data<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.970> connecting<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.780> each

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
collecting data and connecting with each

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.130 
collecting data and connecting with each
other<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:56.040> use<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.369> iPhone<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
other you use an iPhone to do this so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
other you use an iPhone to do this so
the<00:01:58.259> wheel<00:01:58.409> actually<00:01:58.799> works<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.700> any

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the wheel actually works with any

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.639 
the wheel actually works with any
smartphone<00:02:00.149> we've<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.079> made<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> where

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
smartphone we've also made it to where

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.840 
smartphone we've also made it to where
you<00:02:01.829> could<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.100> there's<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> switch<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you could just there's a switch on the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.130 
you could just there's a switch on the
wheel<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> don't<00:02:03.689> actually<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> have

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
wheel so you don't actually have to have

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.899 
wheel so you don't actually have to have
smart<00:02:04.530> phone<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> power<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
smart phone but the power of the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.100 
smart phone but the power of the
smartphone<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.899> can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
smartphone is that actually you can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.870 
smartphone is that actually you can
immediately<00:02:07.619> see<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.129> real<00:02:08.250> time<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.520> day

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
immediately see in real time the day

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.910 
immediately see in real time the day
you're<00:02:09.150> collecting<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:09.870> inside<00:02:10.410> our<00:02:10.590> wheel<00:02:10.740> we

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
you're collecting so inside our wheel we

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.340 
you're collecting so inside our wheel we
have<00:02:11.100> since<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> variety<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.810> environmental

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
have since or a variety of environmental

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.500 
have since or a variety of environmental
sensors<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.400> gps<00:02:14.580> tracking<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.450> you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
sensors you have gps tracking and you

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.570 
sensors you have gps tracking and you
can<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.720> live<00:02:15.900> updates<00:02:15.930> about<00:02:16.530> em<00:02:16.890> where<00:02:17.460> you

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
can get live updates about em where you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.040 
can get live updates about em where you
are<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> city<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> status<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
are in the city what the status of the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.930 
are in the city what the status of the
city<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.470> where<00:02:19.770> your<00:02:19.890> friends<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.370> how<00:02:20.790> does

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
city is where your friends are how does

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.310 
city is where your friends are how does
it<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.360> how<00:02:21.570> do<00:02:21.630> how<00:02:21.870> does<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.170> where

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
it do this how do how does it know where

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.530 
it do this how do how does it know where
traffic<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.220> how<00:02:23.490> does<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.760> analyzed

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
traffic is or how does it analyzed

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.050 
traffic is or how does it analyzed
particulates<00:02:25.280> everything<00:02:26.280> talks<00:02:26.550> these<00:02:26.820> days

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
particulates everything talks these days

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.370 
particulates everything talks these days
so<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.540> actually<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:27.900> information

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
so we can actually get information

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.950 
so we can actually get information
everywhere<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> through<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.910> smartphone<00:02:30.840> you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
everywhere and through a smartphone you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.360 
everywhere and through a smartphone you
can<00:02:30.990> actually<00:02:31.380> pull<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.190> data

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
can actually pull in all of this data

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.250 
can actually pull in all of this data
and<00:02:32.730> then<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.330> bike<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.690> actually<00:02:34.020> assess

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and then the bike can actually assess

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.990 
and then the bike can actually assess
what<00:02:34.350> kind<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.710> information<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.280> need<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
what kind of information you need so it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.340 
what kind of information you need so it
can<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.510> you're<00:02:36.660> approaching<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
can see if you're approaching a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.650 
can see if you're approaching a
potential<00:02:38.190> traffic<00:02:38.400> congestion<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.180> make

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
potential traffic congestion and make

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.060 
potential traffic congestion and make
suggestions<00:02:40.050> maybe<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.530> want<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.740> reroute

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
suggestions maybe you want to reroute

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.350 
suggestions maybe you want to reroute
maybe<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.520> don't<00:02:41.610> want<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.850> be<00:02:41.940> next<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.210> all

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
maybe you don't want to be next to all

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
maybe you don't want to be next to all
the<00:02:42.480> car<00:02:42.690> exhaust<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.620> this<00:02:44.010> bike<00:02:44.190> can

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the car exhaust so this bike can

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.440 
the car exhaust so this bike can
actually<00:02:44.670> give<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
actually give you all of that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.510 
actually give you all of that
information<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> Copenhagen<00:02:47.490> wheel

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
information if the Copenhagen wheel

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.250 
information if the Copenhagen wheel
sounds<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.270> something<00:02:48.660> you'd<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.140> get

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
sounds like something you'd like to get

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.200 
sounds like something you'd like to get
your<00:02:49.410> hands<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.370> love<00:02:50.640> your<00:02:50.850> current

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
your hands on but you love your current

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.910 
your hands on but you love your current
bike<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:51.810> don't<00:02:52.200> want<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.440> buy<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> whole<00:02:52.890> new

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
bike or don't want to buy a whole new

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.520 
bike or don't want to buy a whole new
one<00:02:53.340> don't<00:02:53.910> worry<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.900> actually<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
one don't worry so actually the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.140 
one don't worry so actually the
interesting<00:02:56.430> thing<00:02:56.550> about<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:56.910> at

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
interesting thing about this at

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.790 
interesting thing about this at
Copenhagen<00:02:57.810> wheel<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.290> we're<00:02:58.740> not

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
Copenhagen wheel is that we're not

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.950 
Copenhagen wheel is that we're not
actually<00:02:59.010> proposing<00:02:59.790> an<00:03:00.030> electric<00:03:00.390> bike<00:03:00.600> but

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
actually proposing an electric bike but

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960 
actually proposing an electric bike but
actually<00:03:01.200> an<00:03:01.260> electric<00:03:01.620> wheel<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.640> makes<00:03:02.850> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
actually an electric wheel this makes it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.340 
actually an electric wheel this makes it
to<00:03:03.030> where<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.210> can<00:03:03.360> use<00:03:03.390> your<00:03:03.600> existing<00:03:03.990> bike

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
to where you can use your existing bike

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.900 
to where you can use your existing bike
and<00:03:04.590> by<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:04.980> switching<00:03:05.250> out<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.400> back<00:03:05.640> wheel

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
and by just switching out the back wheel

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.210 
and by just switching out the back wheel
you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:06.900> completely<00:03:07.320> transform<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:08.010> bike

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you can completely transform your bike

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.190 
you can completely transform your bike
into<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.940> data<00:03:09.180> collector<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:09.720> then<00:03:09.810> also<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
into a data collector and then also it

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.020 
into a data collector and then also it
has<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.350> motor<00:03:10.650> inside<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.220> um<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> way<00:03:11.940> it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
has a motor inside it um and the way it

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.130 
has a motor inside it um and the way it
works<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.420> actually<00:03:12.690> through<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> torque

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
works is actually through a torque

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.100 
works is actually through a torque
sensor<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.710> there's<00:03:13.890> no<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.460> off<00:03:14.580> switch

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
sensor so there's no on and off switch

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.780 
sensor so there's no on and off switch
while<00:03:16.110> you're<00:03:16.260> pedaling<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:17.580> do<00:03:17.760> is

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
while you're pedaling so what you do is

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.250 
while you're pedaling so what you do is
you<00:03:18.000> decide<00:03:18.270> ahead<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.510> time<00:03:18.600> how<00:03:18.750> much<00:03:19.110> energy

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
you decide ahead of time how much energy

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.960 
you decide ahead of time how much energy
you<00:03:19.620> know<00:03:19.770> are<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.280> using<00:03:20.730> today

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
you know are you going to be using today

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.790 
you know are you going to be using today
maybe<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:21.930> kind<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.170> slow<00:03:22.320> day<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.500> you

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
maybe it's kind of a slow day for you

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.400 
maybe it's kind of a slow day for you
want<00:03:23.010> maximum<00:03:23.520> power<00:03:23.700> as<00:03:24.630> soon<00:03:24.840> as<00:03:24.960> it<00:03:25.080> senses

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
want maximum power as soon as it senses

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.900 
want maximum power as soon as it senses
you<00:03:25.530> struggling<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.250> when<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:26.610> start<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
you struggling so when you start to

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.640 
you struggling so when you start to
really<00:03:27.060> put<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.330> lot<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.720> effort<00:03:28.320> into<00:03:28.560> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
really put a lot of it effort into the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.530 
really put a lot of it effort into the
pedals<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.430> motor<00:03:29.640> kicks<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.270> just<00:03:30.360> kind

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
pedals the motor kicks on and just kind

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.750 
pedals the motor kicks on and just kind
of<00:03:30.570> settling<00:03:30.960> adjust<00:03:31.380> your<00:03:32.100> pedaling<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.640> that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
of settling adjust your pedaling so that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.190 
of settling adjust your pedaling so that
it's<00:03:32.880> a<00:03:32.910> little<00:03:32.940> bit<00:03:33.120> easier<00:03:33.300> are<00:03:33.960> these

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
it's a little bit easier are these

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.100 
it's a little bit easier are these
wheels<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:34.890> all<00:03:35.100> like<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:36.090> devices<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.750> they

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
wheels at all like the devices that they

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.410 
wheels at all like the devices that they
have<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.590> stationary<00:03:38.130> bikes<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.760> Jim's<00:03:39.030> maybe

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
have in stationary bikes and Jim's maybe

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.600 
have in stationary bikes and Jim's maybe
some<00:03:39.750> people<00:03:40.709> at<00:03:40.770> home<00:03:40.920> are<00:03:41.100> saying<00:03:41.160> oh<00:03:41.400> yeah<00:03:41.580> I

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
some people at home are saying oh yeah I

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.630 
some people at home are saying oh yeah I
already<00:03:41.820> put<00:03:42.150> my<00:03:42.209> ipod<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:43.380> my<00:03:43.890> bike<00:03:44.250> at<00:03:44.490> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
already put my ipod on my bike at the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.960 
already put my ipod on my bike at the
gym<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> track<00:03:45.450> how<00:03:45.750> far<00:03:46.260> I've<00:03:46.410> gone<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:47.100> how

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
gym in track how far I've gone and how

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.120 
gym in track how far I've gone and how
many<00:03:48.030> calories<00:03:48.300> I've<00:03:48.690> burned<00:03:48.990> is<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.920> similar

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
many calories I've burned is it similar

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.130 
many calories I've burned is it similar
technology<00:03:50.820> we're<00:03:51.690> definitely<00:03:51.840> interested

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
technology we're definitely interested

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.110 
technology we're definitely interested
in<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.590> kind<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.860> technology<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:54.000> of

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
in that kind of technology and one of

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.430 
in that kind of technology and one of
the<00:03:54.180> features<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.720> bike<00:03:54.870> actually<00:03:55.140> is

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
the features of the bike actually is

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.410 
the features of the bike actually is
that<00:03:55.560> there's<00:03:55.709> different<00:03:56.010> levels<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.550> motor

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
that there's different levels of motor

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.720 
that there's different levels of motor
assists<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.110> can<00:03:58.260> give<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.740> then<00:03:59.250> also

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
assists that you can give and then also

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.980 
assists that you can give and then also
there's<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> opposite<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.900> can

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
there's the opposite of that so you can

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.080 
there's the opposite of that so you can
actually<00:04:01.200> set<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.950> bike<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.550> work<00:04:02.580> against

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
actually set the bike to work against

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.730 
actually set the bike to work against
you<00:04:03.209> so<00:04:03.420> maybe<00:04:03.600> you're<00:04:03.840> always<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.320> very

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
you so maybe you're always on a very

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.199 
you so maybe you're always on a very
flat<00:04:05.010> surface<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.850> want<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.090> get<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
flat surface and you want to get a

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.820 
flat surface and you want to get a
little<00:04:06.330> bit<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.600> an<00:04:06.690> exercise<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.709> can

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
little bit of an exercise so you can

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.260 
little bit of an exercise so you can
actually<00:04:07.950> make<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> bike<00:04:08.490> work<00:04:08.670> against<00:04:09.120> you

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
actually make the bike work against you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.240 
actually make the bike work against you
and<00:04:09.450> some<00:04:09.570> when<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.720> pedal<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.170> kind<00:04:11.130> of<00:04:11.160> goes

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
and some when you pedal it kind of goes

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.620 
and some when you pedal it kind of goes
you<00:04:11.550> know<00:04:11.670> pushes<00:04:12.030> against<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.540> to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
you know pushes against you and to

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.910 
you know pushes against you and to
really<00:04:12.870> get<00:04:12.990> a<00:04:13.050> workout<00:04:13.350> out<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.830> a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
really get a workout out of just a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.370 
really get a workout out of just a
regular<00:04:14.130> bike<00:04:14.730> group<00:04:15.030> that's<00:04:15.780> great<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.200> tell

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
regular bike group that's great and tell

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.719 
regular bike group that's great and tell
me<00:04:16.470> about<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> design<00:04:17.040> that's<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.489> part<00:04:17.669> that

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
me about the design that's the part that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.150 
me about the design that's the part that
you<00:04:18.000> initially<00:04:18.479> became<00:04:18.930> involved<00:04:19.260> with<00:04:19.470> right

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
you initially became involved with right

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.500 
you initially became involved with right
so<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.430> design<00:04:20.640> was<00:04:20.790> actually<00:04:20.850> a<00:04:21.150> really<00:04:21.239> fun

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
so the design was actually a really fun

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.970 
so the design was actually a really fun
part<00:04:21.780> of

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
part of

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.620 
part of
because<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.430> wanted<00:04:22.700> this<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:23.060> be<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.510> be<00:04:23.540> a

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
because we wanted this to be to be a

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
because we wanted this to be to be a
statement<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:24.200> mean<00:04:24.350> it's<00:04:24.500> definitely

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
statement I mean it's definitely

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.740 
statement I mean it's definitely
something<00:04:25.240> unusual<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.270> see<00:04:26.450> on<00:04:26.570> a<00:04:26.600> bicycle

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
something unusual to see on a bicycle

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.630 
something unusual to see on a bicycle
but<00:04:27.290> we<00:04:27.380> also<00:04:27.500> wanted<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.890> be<00:04:28.010> very<00:04:28.190> clearly

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
but we also wanted to be very clearly

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.460 
but we also wanted to be very clearly
integrated<00:04:29.300> into<00:04:29.480> bicycle<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.200> tried<00:04:30.350> to

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
integrated into bicycle so we tried to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.700 
integrated into bicycle so we tried to
make<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:30.620> a<00:04:30.740> sin<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.310> slender<00:04:31.760> and<00:04:32.000> you<00:04:32.480> know

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
make it a sin and slender and you know

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.500 
make it a sin and slender and you know
streamlined<00:04:33.710> as<00:04:33.860> possible<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.240> funny

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
streamlined as possible and a funny

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.000 
streamlined as possible and a funny
thing<00:04:35.660> about<00:04:35.720> it<00:04:36.020> actually<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.680> we<00:04:36.890> had

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
thing about it actually is that we had

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.380 
thing about it actually is that we had
all<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.250> discussion<00:04:37.790> about<00:04:38.000> how<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.210> can

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
all this discussion about how we can

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.880 
all this discussion about how we can
make<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.600> shape<00:04:38.780> really<00:04:39.140> disappear<00:04:39.710> on<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
make the shape really disappear on the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.890 
make the shape really disappear on the
bike<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.250> then<00:04:40.790> in<00:04:41.030> kind<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.420> 11th<00:04:41.780> hour

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900
