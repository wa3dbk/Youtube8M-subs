00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
and marksman for some reason I thought

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.330 
and marksman for some reason I thought
marksmen<00:00:39.750> would<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.079> appropriate<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.129> could

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
marksmen would be appropriate so I could

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
marksmen would be appropriate so I could
see<00:00:41.489> them<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.760> even<00:00:41.910> greater<00:00:42.210> distances<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
see them are even greater distances I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.900 
see them are even greater distances I
should<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.860> had<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.129> steady<00:00:44.489> aim<00:00:44.700> or

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
should have had like steady aim or

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.459 
should have had like steady aim or
something<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.780> steady<00:00:46.050> aim<00:00:46.230> does

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
something I don't have steady aim does

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.740

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this area here because I know if I did I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.399 
this area here because I know if I did I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
own little brain and you know why it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.219 
own little brain and you know why it's
somewhat<00:01:45.180> worked<00:01:45.420> because<00:01:45.659> my<00:01:45.869> kill<00:01:46.079> death

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
somewhat worked because my kill death

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.700 
somewhat worked because my kill death
