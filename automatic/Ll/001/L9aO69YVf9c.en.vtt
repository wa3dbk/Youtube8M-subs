weren't too worried about me the two
twins<00:06:45.679> but<00:06:46.009> that<00:06:46.699> was<00:06:47.059> a<00:06:47.299> very<00:06:47.569> memorable<00:06:47.839> book

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
twins but that was a very memorable book

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:49.959 
twins but that was a very memorable book
memorable<00:06:49.039> experience<00:06:49.519> too<00:06:49.699> so<00:06:49.849> I<00:06:49.939> guess

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:49.969 
memorable experience too so I guess

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.779 
memorable experience too so I guess
that's<00:06:50.239> total<00:06:50.779> of<00:06:50.869> three<00:06:51.079> anyway<00:06:51.919> I<00:06:52.369> thought

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:52.789 
that's total of three anyway I thought

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.769 
that's total of three anyway I thought
I'd<00:06:52.939> make<00:06:53.119> a<00:06:53.149> quick<00:06:53.389> video<00:06:53.539> about<00:06:53.719> it<00:06:54.079> see<00:06:54.649> ya
