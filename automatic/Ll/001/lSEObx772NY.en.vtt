00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 My name is Tor-Arne Eilertsen. Hi, my name is Thor-Ana Ellerson. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 I live in Kasfurd, around Hasched in northern Norway. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 I now run a dairy factory and a meat factory. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 In 2008 I installed a DeLaval automatic milking machine VMS. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 This machine 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 It has been operating for 5 years now. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 In addition, the herd flow system is designed with feeding priority. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 It becomes a system with the automatic milking machine VMS 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 On average, about 50-60 cows in my barn are lactating cows. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 What I appreciate is that we have a chance today. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Modern high-tech and biological sciences can be used in the milk industry's production process 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Beautifully combined 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Before working on the automatic milking machine, 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 One of the most important factors is 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Well-functioning cowshed environment 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 An effective herd flow system is another important factor. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 There are many effective ways to do this. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Let the cows cycle around in the cowshed 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It is expected that cows will remain in motion for most of the day. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Use to get the best cow circulation 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Many factors that may have affected have been discussed 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 One of them is to use the feeding truck to frequently distribute coarse forage. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Therefore, the feeding area should ensure that there is sufficient forage 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Allow cattle to graze in the area at any time 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 This is probably one of the most important factors 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 But I found that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Driving herd 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 The most important factor in milking 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Is the supply of concentrate 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 This is the core driving the dairy flow system 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 My personal opinion is that the concentrate is the core strength of the entire barn drive. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 When using concentrate to drive the flow of cattle, 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 There are some points that are crucial 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Today, many ranchers roughly estimate 33 00:02:37,000 --&gt; 00:00:42,000 A concentrate station can feed 25 cows in a cowshed. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 And the milking robot is also seen as a concentrate feeding station. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 I think this is wrong. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Feeding 25 animals at a feeding station 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 I personally think it is not enough. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 And the milking robot should not be seen as a concentrate feeding station. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 In fact if 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Having a good cow flow system means 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Can best play the role of VMS 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And this also becomes a prerequisite for ensuring the health of dairy cows. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 If the herd flow system is working well 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Cows can pass the smart door several times a day 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Then I can milk it as many times as I want. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 I have done this now. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 If the cows flow like I hoped 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Then using with somatic cell measurements will allow for more efficient milking 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Somatic cell measurement of milk after each milking 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Moreover, the breasts are also cleaned more often 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Like the calf sucking breasts under natural conditions 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 10-12 times a day 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Under these conditions you can get a healthier herd, which is what I try to do. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And includes reasonable control of herd flow and somatic cell counts 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 When I saw the growth of the number of somatic cells of a certain cow, 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 I will reduce the time between the milking interval of this cow. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And through the control of the smart door, she is more often milked. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 In general, cattle can be squeezed to 8-9 kg at a time, which of course is related to annual production. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 But generally 9 kg may be the average of the amount of milk being milked. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 If I see an increase in the number of somatic cells in a cow, 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Especially those groups where the number of somatic cells changes frequently, I will 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Reduce their milking interval and reduce the allowable milking to 5 kg 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 When I do this, you will find that the number of somatic cells drops quickly. 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Replaced the rise of non-health 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 All this change will happen within 24 hours 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 The sooner the milking interval is lowered, the faster the cow will be 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Return to the normal value of the number of somatic cells 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 This is the basic management philosophy of this system. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 It can have a positive impact on annual production 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 I found the OCC to run very stable. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Compared with traditional somatic cell number measurement methods, 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 It can give very much to the number of somatic cells 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Precise measurement 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 This somatic measurement method can tell you immediately which cow has a problem with the breast. 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 If the cow has acute mastitis, the sharp increase in the number of somatic cells can immediately convey information directly to you. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 You can of course also draw conclusions by monitoring changes in conductivity and salt content. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 But these changes will be slow, you wonâ€™t know the problem immediately as you have OCC. 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 OCC tests every milking of each cow 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 I think OCC is a reliable investment because it can make you 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 Identify problems early so that certain individuals can be made 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 Get antibiotic treatment 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 If you milk alone in the traditional way, it means increased costs and workload. 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 And the loss of milk production 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 I want to buy OCC based on VMS. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Equipment costs will be compensated several times soon 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 OCC became the most successful investment in cattle house in addition to VMS
