sixteenth note so one E and uh one E and
a<00:01:40.109> one<00:01:40.439> E<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:40.710> AH<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.609> get<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:55.100> which<00:01:56.100> we

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
a one E and AH you get this which we

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
a one E and AH you get this which we
Pizan<00:01:56.610> itself<00:01:56.970> now<00:01:57.360> let's<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.930> usable<00:01:58.649> so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
Pizan itself now let's make it usable so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
Pizan itself now let's make it usable so
we<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.280> play<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.820> gig<00:02:00.000> scenario<00:02:00.390> by

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
we can we can play in a gig scenario by

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
we can we can play in a gig scenario by
putting<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.040> snare<00:02:02.250> drum<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> downbeat

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
putting the snare drum on the downbeat

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:13.280 
putting the snare drum on the downbeat
so<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> falling<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> two<00:02:12.569> or<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.989> five

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
so so the falling on the two or the five

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.330 
so so the falling on the two or the five
if<00:02:13.470> you're<00:02:13.590> counting<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:13.980> two<00:02:14.010> three<00:02:14.220> four

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
if you're counting one two three four

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.920 
if you're counting one two three four
five<00:02:14.489> six<00:02:14.550> seven<00:02:14.819> eight<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
five six seven eight and then we do the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.630 
five six seven eight and then we do the
same<00:02:16.140> process<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.920> bass<00:02:17.099> drum<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.519> this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
same process with the bass drum so this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:43.640 
same process with the bass drum so this
is<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.930> key<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.260> here<00:02:43.500> is

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
is what you get the key is here is

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.259 
is what you get the key is here is
