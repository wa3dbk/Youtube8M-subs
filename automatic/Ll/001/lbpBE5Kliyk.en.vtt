a Mia strd 101 five I've had this thing

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.090 
a Mia strd 101 five I've had this thing
for<00:01:22.360> years<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.140> just<00:01:23.289> got<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.770> one<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:23.979> just

for years I just got this one I just

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.410 
for years I just got this one I just
fixed<00:01:24.549> this<00:01:24.670> one

tweeters<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:40.780> these<00:01:41.259> fissures<00:01:41.799> yet<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.819> I

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
tweeters in these fissures yet and I

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.480 
tweeters in these fissures yet and I
know<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.569> can't<00:01:43.990> find<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.319> power<00:01:44.500> supplies<00:01:45.009> for

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
know I can't find the power supplies for

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.850 
know I can't find the power supplies for
the<00:01:45.729> EPS<00:01:46.539> so<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.959> woofers<00:01:47.289> are<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:47.619> playing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
the EPS so the woofers are just playing

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.620 
the EPS so the woofers are just playing
in<00:01:48.009> these<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.579> mid<00:01:48.700> ranges<00:01:49.000> in<00:01:49.209> the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
in these in the mid ranges in the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.569 
in these in the mid ranges in the
fissures<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.560> that's<00:01:50.709> why<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> treble

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
fissures so that's why I have the treble

00:01:51.579 --> 00:02:00.899 
fissures so that's why I have the treble
cranked<00:01:51.909> on<00:01:51.969> these<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.979> vibrates<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.640> floor

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
cranked on these that vibrates the floor

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.609 
cranked on these that vibrates the floor
look<00:02:01.090> crazy

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.310 

and<00:02:05.130> I'm<00:02:05.969> gonna<00:02:06.119> interconnect<00:02:06.780> these<00:02:06.929> these

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and I'm gonna interconnect these these

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.550 
and I'm gonna interconnect these these
both<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.859> video<00:02:08.459> inputs<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.149> outputs<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.750> in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
both have video inputs and outputs as in

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.729 
both have video inputs and outputs as in
video<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.340> audio<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.910> I've<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.200> fan

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
video for audio and I've got this fan

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.160 
video for audio and I've got this fan
here<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.430> amplifier<00:02:14.849> gets<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.569> hot<00:02:15.930> for

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
here this amplifier gets really hot for

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.009 
here this amplifier gets really hot for
some<00:02:16.410> reason<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.300> does<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.599> one<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:18.900> not

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
some reason but so does that one but not

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.940 
some reason but so does that one but not
as<00:02:19.140> bad<00:02:20.299> but<00:02:21.299> I've<00:02:21.569> got<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.810> connected<00:02:22.230> into

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
as bad but I've got it connected into

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.650 
as bad but I've got it connected into
I've<00:02:23.220> gotta<00:02:23.459> interconnected<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.209> amplifier

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
I've gotta interconnected with amplifier

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.030 
I've gotta interconnected with amplifier
watch<00:02:24.870> when<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.049> turn<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.319> on<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.209> yeah

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.890 

so<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> audio<00:02:33.540> coming<00:02:33.870> from

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
so I have the audio coming from

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.619 
so I have the audio coming from
television<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.950> receiver<00:02:35.310> box<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
television on the receiver box going to

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.420 
television on the receiver box going to
here<00:02:36.989> then<00:02:37.230> coming<00:02:37.500> back<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.220> into

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
here then coming back out of here into

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.410 
here then coming back out of here into
here<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.890> center<00:02:41.220> channel<00:02:41.430> speakers

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
here and the center channel speakers

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.949 
here and the center channel speakers
right<00:02:42.659> here<00:02:43.019> will<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:43.980> powered<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.430> this

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
right here will be powered with this

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.589 
right here will be powered with this
Rotel<00:02:45.959> amplifier<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.939> then<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.120> got<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.269> CD

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
Rotel amplifier and then I got a CD

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.140 
Rotel amplifier and then I got a CD
player<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.989> record<00:02:49.260> player<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:50.000> I've<00:02:51.000> also

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
player and a record player and I've also

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.520 
player and a record player and I've also
got<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.390> few<00:02:51.659> cassette<00:02:51.989> decks<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.290> need<00:02:52.440> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
got a few cassette decks I need to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.539 
got a few cassette decks I need to
install<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:54.750> let's<00:02:55.319> change<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.310> station

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
install but let's change the station

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.979 
install but let's change the station
this<00:02:56.879> thing<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.450> kind<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.780> hard<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
this thing right here is kind of hard to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.599 
this thing right here is kind of hard to
change<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.440> station<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.859> have<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.040> get<00:02:59.340> just

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
change the station you have to get just

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:55.770 
change the station you have to get just
