in<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.960> video<00:00:01.350> for<00:00:01.589> my<00:00:01.740> tea<00:00:01.800> free<00:00:02.220> training<00:00:02.610> I

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
in this video for my tea free training I

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this video for my tea free training I
will<00:00:03.030> look<00:00:03.389> at<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.689> different<00:00:04.110> components<00:00:04.259> in

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
will look at the different components in

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.519 
will look at the different components in
Active<00:00:05.250> Directory<00:00:05.279> Federation<00:00:05.910> services<00:00:06.720> in

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
Active Directory Federation services in

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.280 
Active Directory Federation services in
particular<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.240> looks<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.599> what<00:00:10.080> each

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
particular this video looks at what each

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
particular this video looks at what each
component<00:00:10.740> does<00:00:11.280> rather<00:00:11.759> than<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> features

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
component does rather than the features

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.820 
component does rather than the features
each<00:00:12.929> version<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.380> Active<00:00:13.710> Directory

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
each version of Active Directory

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.849 
each version of Active Directory
Federation<00:00:14.309> services<00:00:15.059> has<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.619> will

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
Federation services has that I will

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.870 
Federation services has that I will
leave<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> different<00:00:17.640> video

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
leave to a different video

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.019 
leave to a different video
as<00:00:18.939> shown<00:00:19.929> the<00:00:20.439> components<00:00:21.189> change<00:00:21.460> depending

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
as shown the components change depending

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.519 
as shown the components change depending
on<00:00:22.150> which<00:00:22.419> version<00:00:22.480> of<00:00:23.019> Active<00:00:23.410> Directory

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
on which version of Active Directory

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.409 
on which version of Active Directory

however<00:00:26.289> most<00:00:26.949> of<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.279> changes<00:00:27.730> are<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.269> the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
however most of the changes are to the

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.979 
however most of the changes are to the
name<00:00:28.720> or<00:00:28.989> the<00:00:29.140> location<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.189> component

is Active Directory Federation services

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.999 
is Active Directory Federation services

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.370 
and the main component is Federation
services<00:01:06.490> so<00:01:07.299> the<00:01:07.420> main<00:01:07.630> difference<00:01:08.229> between

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380

this and version 3 is that the

Federation service component is now a

Federation service component is now a
role<00:01:13.150> rather<00:01:13.570> than<00:01:13.869> a<00:01:13.960> component<00:01:14.409> of<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.950> role

look at this in a moment but essentially

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.690

has the same functionality as Federation
service<00:03:37.970> proxy<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.600> thus<00:03:39.230> replaces<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.130> the

point to remember is that it has the

point to remember is that it has the
