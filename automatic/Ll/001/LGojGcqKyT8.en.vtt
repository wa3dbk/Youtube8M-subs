00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 U 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.340
 U 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.210
 l3 919 yb 700 ea The most basic performance difference is Gwangyang 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.720
 You can see it. 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.750
 Until the day the Gwangyang difference is somewhat difference 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.750
 Let me explain what I understand. 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.270
 In fact the 910 Epi 's chip 10 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.180
 80 s1 911 when viewed in the performance of cancer 100% O color therapy 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.949
 Show performance of 80 pros 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.340
 Joe talk show direction ah, if not the performance Can he do you know 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:54.880
 I can confirm that it is beyond the guide 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.530
 If you have a guide number 1 and you see that stack on the homepage 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:02.170
 There are a lot of people in front of the lot . 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:07.869
 What temperature is one at all income surveys chicken at 20 degrees is what is represented 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:12.729
 But when you look at the numbers in 201 it is marked as sd 2 melting 48 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:19.119
 There will be and s2 700 won 39 It will be pooled 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:21.729
 So take a look at calculating 39 to 48 show the Gwangyang No. 80 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.829
 You know 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:32.289
 Little toad when things are actually shooting doenya make any difference If yo 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:37.719
 In case of sb 910, it supports up to 200mm telephoto 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:44.950
 On the other hand, the sd 700 will support up to 120mm . 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:52.109
 Of course , 0.6m from the distance 0.6m to 20m from the two flash 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:57.860
 I will accompany you, but when you give rnz support to your mind, 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:02:00.640
 $ 80 cb support. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.640
 U 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810
 U 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:15.950
 If you look at the flash mode of Uh Ne Tree 910 and its breath 700 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 By default, m mode after tt or pta mode 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:25.910
 Whoa you name two, it is common to both Flash 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.370
 But if you look a little further, there is sl 910 , 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.610
 There are two modes that do not exist 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.470
 The first is called a while the second is called rpt mode. 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.170
 Let me give you an explanation. 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:48.890
 2 a mode control function tl before the camera, unplug unprecedented 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:52.310
 Mount other cameras with 2 sb 700 or 910 of other cameras 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.540
 That is the mode you can use when you are 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.500
 It's a little eoryeopjyo Paris To explain difficult words easily 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.950
 For sb 910 is in a mode yi raneunge 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.830
 In the old camera that I learned a while ago 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.420
 John and automatically talk to that can be taken to calculate the Gwangyang sd for a friend 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.790
 There is no mode 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.900
 To calculate and write directions automatically Nikon's latest dts sense 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.500
 By product only 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.810
 I can shoot you. I am. 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.480
 Battery 912 has such an advantage that it can be used on a slightly different camera 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:35.600
 That did me in, and you have had 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.410
 There are many Nikon cameras, five different cameras, a cam 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.610
 camera 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.020
 I will spend two days there this well as features that do not need all his 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.020
 You can see it. 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.020
 U 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 U 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.970
 The second mode is sb-900 10 and sd 700 yen 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:03.430
 rpt mode 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:09.370
 Yale pt is a ret luminosity scholar and no fittings luminescent patient 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.570
 While taking a picture, the flash will emit light to give you exposure. 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.370
 I will. 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:19.840
 In general, when shooting a fast-moving subject 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:25.900
 Mode. When you shoot a fast-moving body, 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:32.260
 When you move, the flash replenishes every time you do your arm 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:37.660
 There is such an effect because it shows a little consecutive minutes of motion 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:43.360
 However, this rpt mode is just generally used to flash the amount of light 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:49.540
 Or write to the lack julyeojwo what language one contests yet give up this mainly 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.300
 Because it is a rather specific purpose rather than a purpose, 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:58.300
 It's not in writing mode . 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:02.260
 So the sc method is enough for general use, but ssd 910 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:09.210
 There's one more thing that's funny. 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.210
 I will take 9 minutes and make a selection. 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.400
 Oo
