00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
both of these to be fair to the apogee I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.530 
both of these to be fair to the apogee I
am<00:00:40.079> also<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.739> give<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.700> hint<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
am also going to give it just a hint of

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.619 
am also going to give it just a hint of
compression<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:44.340> EQ<00:00:44.910> because<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
compression and a little EQ because the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
compression and a little EQ because the
diaphragm<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.530> microphone<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.129> much

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
diaphragm on that microphone is much

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.729 
diaphragm on that microphone is much
smaller<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> gnomon<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
smaller than the one on the gnomon the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
smaller than the one on the gnomon the
comparison<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.340> start<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> gnomon

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
comparison will start with the gnomon

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
comparison will start with the gnomon
microphone<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.710> you'll<00:00:52.829> hear<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
microphone and then you'll hear the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.270 
microphone and then you'll hear the
exact<00:00:53.460> same<00:00:53.640> line<00:00:53.940> recorded<00:00:54.629> through<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
exact same line recorded through the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
exact same line recorded through the
apogee<00:00:56.640> mic<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.750> doing<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.050> promo<00:00:58.350> say

so<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.420> again<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> little

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
so now again there was a little

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130 
so now again there was a little
compression<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.670> EQ<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:48.090> both<00:01:48.479> mics<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.049> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
compression and EQ on both mics and I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
compression and EQ on both mics and I
brought<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.860> apogee<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.460> up<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.850> sounds<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
brought the apogee one up to sounds is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690 
brought the apogee one up to sounds is
