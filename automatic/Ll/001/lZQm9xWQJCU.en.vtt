two different sizes there's kind of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.540 
two different sizes there's kind of
regular<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.410> guess<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> smaller<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
regular and I guess a smaller one you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.770 
regular and I guess a smaller one you
know<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> doesn't<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.180> doesn't<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
know it doesn't it doesn't really make a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.410 
know it doesn't it doesn't really make a
difference<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.980> five<00:01:02.850> different<00:01:03.030> font

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
difference with five different font

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.410 
difference with five different font
sizes<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.860> also<00:01:04.979> search<00:01:05.309> text<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.299> can

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
sizes you can also search text you can

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.109 
sizes you can also search text you can
adjust<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.810> brightness<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.970> also

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
adjust the brightness and you can also

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:06.490 
lit up to see if you can go out to the
beach<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.970> actually<00:02:00.970> read<00:02:01.210> an<00:02:01.330> iPad

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.320 

so<00:02:07.130> as<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.580> can<00:02:07.700> see<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.390> kind<00:02:08.600> of<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:08.810> very

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
so as you can see it's kind of it's very

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.270 
so as you can see it's kind of it's very
we<00:02:10.780> can't<00:02:10.990> actually<00:02:11.080> see<00:02:11.350> anything<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:12.040> gloss

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
we can't actually see anything the gloss

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.070 
we can't actually see anything the gloss
finish<00:02:12.670> allows<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.390> very<00:02:13.480> reflective

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
finish allows it to be very reflective

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.650 
finish allows it to be very reflective
so<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:14.740> actually<00:02:14.890> looking<00:02:15.160> at<00:02:15.340> my<00:02:15.460> reflection

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so I'm actually looking at my reflection

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.800 
so I'm actually looking at my reflection
more<00:02:16.660> than<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.930> words<00:02:17.110> themselves<00:02:17.670> but

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
more than the words themselves but

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.750 
more than the words themselves but
actually<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.960> our<00:02:20.260> checkbook<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.250> catch

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
actually have our checkbook that catch

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.820 
actually have our checkbook that catch
up<00:02:21.940> with<00:02:22.090> light<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:22.570> also<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.620> as

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
comparison pulling it out of my back

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.860 
comparison pulling it out of my back
