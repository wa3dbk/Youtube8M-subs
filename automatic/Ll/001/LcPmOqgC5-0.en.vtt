00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.210 
I picked up every color of the new of
the<00:03:59.580> new<00:04:00.110> vectors<00:04:01.110> by<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.379> way<00:04:01.709> there<00:04:01.920> sounds

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
the new vectors by the way there sounds

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.210 
the new vectors by the way there sounds
thumb<00:04:02.430> with<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.700> suppressor<00:04:03.330> or<00:04:04.189> extension

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
thumb with the suppressor or extension

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.600 
thumb with the suppressor or extension
barrel<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:06.900> that's<00:04:07.620> that<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:07.980> guess<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.430> could

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
barrel so that's that I guess I could

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:18.400 
barrel so that's that I guess I could
show<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.730> that

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.890 

so<00:04:19.410> by<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.739> way<00:04:19.950> this<00:04:20.130> one<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:21.000> reloaded

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
so by the way this one is the reloaded

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.230 
so by the way this one is the reloaded
one<00:04:22.260> so<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.490> prototype<00:04:23.730> one

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
one so this is like the prototype one

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.690 
one so this is like the prototype one
just<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.630> let<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.900> guys<00:04:24.930> know<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.160> here's<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
just to let you guys know so here's the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.130 
just to let you guys know so here's the
prototype<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.600> Reve

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
prototype it Reve

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.020 
prototype it Reve
reloaded<00:04:28.950> one<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.460> then<00:04:29.700> here's<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
reloaded one and then here's the

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.980 
reloaded one and then here's the
production<00:04:30.870> one<00:04:31.560> right<00:04:31.800> here<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:33.840> could

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
production one right here so you could

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.980 
production one right here so you could
tell<00:04:34.230> by<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.800> difference<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.730> over<00:04:36.630> molten

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
tell by the difference the over molten

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.350 
tell by the difference the over molten
ones<00:04:37.200> two<00:04:37.560> different<00:04:37.920> colors<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:39.180> the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
ones two different colors and the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.860 
ones two different colors and the
production<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:40.140> one<00:04:40.500> solid<00:04:40.710> color<00:04:41.600> but<00:04:42.600> I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
production is just one solid color but I

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.660 
production is just one solid color but I
got<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:44.010> in<00:04:44.700> OD<00:04:45.180> green<00:04:45.390> since<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.670> forgot

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
got this is in OD green since I forgot

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.420 
got this is in OD green since I forgot
to<00:04:47.940> pick<00:04:48.120> up<00:04:48.300> black<00:04:48.570> or<00:04:48.930> they<00:04:49.920> don't<00:04:50.040> have<00:04:50.280> it

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
to pick up black or they don't have it

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.890 
to pick up black or they don't have it
so<00:04:50.730> that's<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.820> then<00:04:53.820> for<00:04:54.090> my<00:04:54.270> other<00:04:54.600> one

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
so that's that and then for my other one

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.070 
so that's that and then for my other one
got<00:04:55.500> an<00:04:55.680> olive<00:04:56.250> green<00:04:56.580> one<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.300> well<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.870> this

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
got an olive green one as well so this

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.650 
got an olive green one as well so this
is<00:04:58.140> actually<00:04:58.590> a<00:04:58.620> really<00:04:58.920> nice<00:04:59.420> color<00:05:00.420> that

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
is actually a really nice color that

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.450 
is actually a really nice color that
Lego<00:05:00.990> has<00:05:01.170> come<00:05:01.410> out<00:05:01.530> with<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.300> that's<00:05:03.300> that's

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
Lego has come out with so that's that's

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.850 
Lego has come out with so that's that's
and<00:05:05.460> onto<00:05:05.970> like<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.270> more<00:05:06.510> useful<00:05:07.200> ones<00:05:07.680> I

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
and onto like the more useful ones I

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.680 
and onto like the more useful ones I
guess<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.190> could<00:05:08.340> say<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.490> got<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.790> gunmetal<00:05:09.300> one

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
guess I could say I got a gunmetal one

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.380 
guess I could say I got a gunmetal one
so<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.470> one's<00:05:10.650> really<00:05:10.800> nice<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:11.340> by<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.180> way

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
so that one's really nice and by the way

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.840 
so that one's really nice and by the way
they<00:05:12.540> all<00:05:12.690> have<00:05:13.160> holographics<00:05:14.160> on<00:05:14.370> them<00:05:14.580> so

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
they all have holographics on them so

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.090 
they all have holographics on them so
they<00:05:14.970> have<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.240> low<00:05:15.390> holographic<00:05:15.990> so<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.919> got

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
they have that low holographic so I got

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.750 
they have that low holographic so I got
it<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.370> steel<00:05:17.970> as<00:05:18.270> well<00:05:19.310> pretty<00:05:20.310> much<00:05:20.460> every

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
it in steel as well pretty much every

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.480 
it in steel as well pretty much every
color<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.240> then<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.470> got<00:05:22.950> this<00:05:23.460> one<00:05:23.730> in<00:05:24.030> brown

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
color and then I got this one in brown

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.659 
color and then I got this one in brown
and<00:05:27.080> there<00:05:28.080> were<00:05:28.230> their<00:05:28.500> reason<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.250> bought<00:05:29.430> all

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
and there were their reason I bought all

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.310 
and there were their reason I bought all
of<00:05:29.820> them<00:05:29.970> in<00:05:30.060> one<00:05:30.180> color<00:05:30.450> cuz<00:05:30.750> they're<00:05:30.930> at<00:05:31.080> one

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
of them in one color cuz they're at one

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.940 
of them in one color cuz they're at one
dollar<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:32.010> that's<00:05:32.250> a<00:05:32.490> really<00:05:32.760> nice<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.860> I

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
dollar so that's a really nice and I

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.190 
dollar so that's a really nice and I
feel<00:05:35.190> like<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.490> most<00:05:35.640> ones<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.660> can't<00:05:36.960> really

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
feel like the most ones I can't really

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.280 
feel like the most ones I can't really
use<00:05:37.470> but<00:05:37.770> still<00:05:38.370> pretty<00:05:38.550> cool<00:05:38.669> I<00:05:38.820> have<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.419> got<00:05:40.110> a

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
use but still pretty cool I have I got a

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.220 
use but still pretty cool I have I got a
trans<00:05:40.770> clear<00:05:41.340> one<00:05:41.520> which<00:05:41.700> is<00:05:41.880> okay<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:42.480> that

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
trans clear one which is okay so that

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.430 
trans clear one which is okay so that
one's<00:05:43.380> cool<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:45.210> then<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:45.450> also<00:05:45.600> got<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.930> trans

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
one's cool and then I also got a trans

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.260 
one's cool and then I also got a trans
red<00:05:46.890> one<00:05:47.100> so<00:05:47.370> I'm<00:05:47.490> not<00:05:47.520> too<00:05:47.760> sure<00:05:47.910> what<00:05:47.940> I'll<00:05:48.120> do

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
red one so I'm not too sure what I'll do

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.150 
red one so I'm not too sure what I'll do
without<00:05:48.540> buttons<00:05:48.870> it's<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:49.470> cool<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.830> have<00:05:49.980> it

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
without buttons it's so cool to have it

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.820 
without buttons it's so cool to have it

brick<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.230> got<00:05:55.470> a<00:05:55.500> pink<00:05:56.370> stout<00:05:56.730> then<00:05:56.970> I<00:05:57.150> think

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
brick I got a pink stout then I think

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.420 
brick I got a pink stout then I think
that<00:05:57.540> it's<00:05:57.810> called<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.350> about<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.040> removable

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
that it's called so about the removable

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.540 
that it's called so about the removable
mag<00:05:59.820> like<00:06:00.090> all<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.480> rest<00:06:00.690> of<00:06:00.870> them<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:01.890> that's

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
mag like all the rest of them so that's

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.600 
mag like all the rest of them so that's
that<00:06:03.530> I've<00:06:04.530> actually<00:06:04.710> never<00:06:05.130> owned<00:06:05.430> one<00:06:05.520> of

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
that I've actually never owned one of

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.790 
that I've actually never owned one of
these<00:06:05.820> funds<00:06:06.060> so<00:06:06.210> that's<00:06:06.330> pretty<00:06:06.570> cool<00:06:06.800> so

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
these funds so that's pretty cool so

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.620 
these funds so that's pretty cool so
that's<00:06:08.100> pretty<00:06:08.340> much<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.730> like<00:06:08.910> my<00:06:09.090> order<00:06:09.419> guys

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
that's pretty much it like my order guys
