00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
can't really judge her by the way that

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.950 
can't really judge her by the way that
she<00:03:54.250> looks<00:03:54.490> because<00:03:54.760> she<00:03:54.940> looks<00:03:55.210> like<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.750> put

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
she looks because she looks like to put

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.230 
she looks because she looks like to put
together<00:03:56.110> but<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.160> know<00:03:57.280> she's<00:03:57.700> very<00:03:57.760> smart

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
together but you know she's very smart

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.230 
together but you know she's very smart
