 the topographic survey by radiation 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:21.100
 materials used tripod ruler theodor

 marreta marie and kate first step 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.220
 materialize the topographic point that 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.220
 will be the seat of radiation 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.510
 the mounted tripod 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:43.819
 the beautiful term is carefully removed 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:43.819
 of the box fixed the theodolite on the tripod 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.759
 the theodolite is centralized in the picket 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.939
 the theodolite is leveled by moving the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.819
 two feet up or down to 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:03:05.340
 that the profic adjusted to the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:03:07.980
 picket if the bubble is 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.159
 fully within the small circle in the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.159
 pum 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.260
 reveal the bubble from above using the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.260
 gallant 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:43.220
 after all adjustments made 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.220
 measurement of the desired area is started 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:58.700
 the zero point is read and the reading is 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.700
 of the lower middle upper wire 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:28.850
 after zeroing the horizontal angle, the note 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:31.310
 the zenith angle and spun yarns one 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.090
 from the horizontal angle to the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.090
 next point 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:11.820
 reading the children and the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:14.700
 angles in digital and horizontal and then 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.600
 only repeat this procedure for the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.600
 other points 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.230
