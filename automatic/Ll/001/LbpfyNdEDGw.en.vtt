00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
be a really good setter and then Ali has

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.690 
be a really good setter and then Ali has
also<00:01:47.560> come<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.860> long<00:01:48.100> way<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> middle

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
also come a long way in the middle

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
think they're wants to watch upgrade up

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.139 
think they're wants to watch upgrade up
and<00:01:57.159> up<00:01:57.429> that's<00:01:58.119> it<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:03.490> ball<00:02:03.729> Tombo<00:02:04.119> Tombo

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.309 
were competitive I think will even take
a<00:02:08.920> step<00:02:09.250> forward<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.849> year<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:11.200> know<00:02:11.290> I

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
a step forward this year so you know I

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.740 
a step forward this year so you know I
think<00:02:11.709> if<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.280> add<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.790> new<00:02:12.970> people<00:02:13.420> with<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
think if you add the new people with the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
think if you add the new people with the
mix<00:02:14.019> we<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.709> our<00:02:14.830> junior<00:02:15.220> class<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:16.150> lone

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
mix we have of our junior class the lone

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.870 
mix we have of our junior class the lone
senior<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.260> think<00:02:18.099> this<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.459> going<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.670> be<00:02:18.849> a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
senior I think this is going to be a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.750 
senior I think this is going to be a
very<00:02:19.360> competitive<00:02:20.290> group<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.310> think

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
very competitive group that I think

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.600 
very competitive group that I think
could<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> lot<00:02:23.019> of<00:02:23.049> damage<00:02:23.440> if<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.069> continue

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
could do a lot of damage if we continue

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360 
could do a lot of damage if we continue
improving<00:02:25.049> this<00:02:26.049> group<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.440> girls<00:02:26.470> gels

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
improving this group of girls gels

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.130 
improving this group of girls gels

good player I want them to want me to
play<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> moment<00:03:14.540> you've<00:03:15.530> got<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.860> be<00:03:15.950> above

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
play the moment you've got to be above

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.090 
play the moment you've got to be above
500<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:17.600> that's<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:18.080> goal<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.320> have<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.830> winning

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
500 so that's a goal that have a winning

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.910 
500 so that's a goal that have a winning
season<00:03:19.400> be<00:03:19.880> above<00:03:20.150> 500<00:03:20.410> it's<00:03:21.410> really

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
season be above 500 it's really

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.800 
season be above 500 it's really
dependent<00:03:22.280> on<00:03:22.640> how<00:03:22.820> well<00:03:23.060> we<00:03:23.090> do<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.540> first

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
dependent on how well we do the first

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.720 
dependent on how well we do the first
three<00:03:24.020> weekends<00:03:24.380> of<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.650> season<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.490> think

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
three weekends of the season and I think

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.460 
three weekends of the season and I think
it<00:03:25.850> really<00:03:25.880> starts<00:03:26.450> with<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.750> first<00:03:27.020> weekend

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
it really starts with that first weekend

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.100 
it really starts with that first weekend
starts<00:03:27.830> with<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.070> first<00:03:28.280> match<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.989> know

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
starts with the first match and you know

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.840 
starts with the first match and you know
I<00:03:30.140> really<00:03:30.350> feel<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.680> one<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.640> real

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
I really feel that one of the real

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.449 
I really feel that one of the real
drawbacks<00:03:32.450> last<00:03:32.870> year<00:03:33.290> was<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> way<00:03:34.100> we<00:03:34.250> got
