00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
doesn't look too bad i'm going to put

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.550 
doesn't look too bad i'm going to put
them<00:02:48.030> into<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.359> fridge<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.079> i<00:02:49.109> can<00:02:49.409> take

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
them into the fridge and then i can take

00:02:49.560 --> 00:03:00.650 
them into the fridge and then i can take
them<00:02:49.709> out

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.810

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
so what kind of failed but I think that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.210

um<00:03:03.210> next<00:03:03.930> time<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.350> make<00:03:04.590> something<00:03:05.100> like

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
um next time that I make something like

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.450 
um next time that I make something like
this<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.790> i<00:03:06.270> will<00:03:07.130> look<00:03:08.130> at<00:03:08.250> better
