calories<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.510> burn<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.050> how<00:00:34.200> many<00:00:34.260> steps<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
calories you burn and how many steps you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.630 
calories you burn and how many steps you
make<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.430> accurate

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
make and I think it's pretty accurate

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.380 
make and I think it's pretty accurate
and<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:40.020> how<00:00:40.170> many<00:00:40.230> steps<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.800> take<00:00:41.059> it<00:00:42.059> can

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and by how many steps you take it can

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.510 
and by how many steps you take it can
track<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:43.079> far<00:00:43.440> you've<00:00:43.649> gone<00:00:43.920> throughout<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
track how far you've gone throughout the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.470 
track how far you've gone throughout the
day<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.969> think<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.690> pretty<00:00:45.840> cool<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.760> yeah

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
day I think that's pretty cool so yeah

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
day I think that's pretty cool so yeah
the<00:00:48.870> steps<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.379> accurate<00:00:50.340> uh<00:00:52.100> sometimes

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the steps are very accurate uh sometimes

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.790 
the steps are very accurate uh sometimes
I've<00:00:54.090> tested<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.410> when<00:00:55.710> I'm

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800

I've tested to see if like when I'm
sitting<00:00:56.039> down<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.640> move<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.660> if

sitting down and move a lot to see if

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.869 
sitting down and move a lot to see if
the<00:00:57.899> step<00:00:58.199> number<00:00:58.440> goes<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.190> sometimes<00:00:59.699> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the step number goes up and sometimes it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.340
