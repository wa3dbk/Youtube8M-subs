produced they were big hits back in the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.359 
produced they were big hits back in the
day<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:26.570> as<00:00:27.570> such<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.380> had<00:00:28.590> exhaust<00:00:29.010> stacks

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
coming up the back of the cab so this

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
coming up the back of the cab so this
kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> follows<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> same<00:00:36.230> general

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
direction of course it's red and there

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.729 
direction of course it's red and there
you<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.530> mr.<00:00:41.120> Norman

so<00:00:50.309> evidently<00:00:50.969> he<00:00:51.210> designed<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> truck

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
trucks interestingly enough the ones in

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.650 
trucks interestingly enough the ones in
78<00:01:40.660> didn't<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.620> catalytic<00:01:42.190> converter<00:01:42.660> but

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
78 didn't have catalytic converter but

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.130 
78 didn't have catalytic converter but
in<00:01:43.810> 79<00:01:44.380> they<00:01:44.590> did<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.860> interior<00:01:48.400> is<00:01:48.550> really

really<00:01:50.140> cool<00:01:50.470> on<00:01:50.650> this<00:01:50.830> vehicle

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.999 

now<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.689> were<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> exhaust<00:02:07.290> stacks<00:02:07.649> there

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
now there were the exhaust stacks there

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.270 
now there were the exhaust stacks there
see<00:02:08.759> them<00:02:08.940> again<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> minute

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.160 

nice<00:02:12.790> gold<00:02:13.630> trim<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.950> side<00:02:16.080> matching<00:02:17.080> the

wheels

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:39.620 

there<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.250> stacks

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.820 

now<00:02:39.960> if<00:02:40.080> you're<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> member<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
now if you're a member of the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.620 
now if you're a member of the
overexpressed<00:02:41.730> trucks<00:02:42.030> had<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:43.550> wooden<00:02:44.630> wooden

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
overexpressed trucks had a wooden wooden

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.440 
overexpressed trucks had a wooden wooden
floor<00:02:45.900> so

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.050 

you'll<00:02:50.020> see<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.440> minute<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:50.920> one<00:02:51.250> mimics

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you'll see in a minute this one mimics

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
you'll see in a minute this one mimics
that<00:02:52.270> also

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.800 

there<00:03:05.680> we<00:03:05.860> are

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
there we are

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.560 
there we are
really
