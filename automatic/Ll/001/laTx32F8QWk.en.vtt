notice this one is blue this one is red
I<00:00:18.869> could<00:00:19.800> stop<00:00:20.039> there<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.460> differences

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
I could stop there at the differences

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.970 
I could stop there at the differences
but<00:00:21.090> what<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.600> means<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.680> has<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
but what that means is that this has a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.970 
but what that means is that this has a
one-year<00:00:23.789> orgy<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> three<00:00:24.980> I'm

generally the blue tools from LD are of

generally the blue tools from LD are of
poor<00:00:29.279> quality<00:00:29.340> than<00:00:30.269> those<00:00:30.539> were<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.019> red<00:00:31.340> that

poor quality than those were in red that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.420 
poor quality than those were in red that
was<00:00:33.450> handled<00:00:33.780> by<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.290> random<00:00:34.530> third-party

it's<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> packed<00:00:45.989> cell<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:47.280> very

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it's a packed cell one very very very

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.290 
it's a packed cell one very very very
similar<00:00:48.270> model<00:00:49.309> has<00:00:50.309> basically<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> exact

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
similar model has basically the exact

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
similar model has basically the exact
same<00:00:51.329> specs<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.469> coloring

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
same specs just different coloring

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220 
same specs just different coloring
different<00:00:53.309> badge<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.960> goes<00:00:55.140> for

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
different badge on and that goes for

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
different badge on and that goes for
about<00:00:55.640> $200<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:57.059> 129<00:00:58.910> Ryobi<00:00:59.910> also

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
about $200 this was 129 Ryobi also

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.479 
about $200 this was 129 Ryobi also
produced<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> exact<00:01:01.140> same<00:01:01.379> unit<00:01:01.739> except<00:01:02.370> in

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
produced the exact same unit except in

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.350 
produced the exact same unit except in
their<00:01:02.670> hideous<00:01:03.739> flora<00:01:04.739> yellowy<00:01:05.369> green<00:01:05.670> column

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
their hideous flora yellowy green column

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
their hideous flora yellowy green column
and<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.350> about<00:01:07.880> 180<00:01:09.080> 198<00:01:10.080> bunnies

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and that's about 180 198 bunnies

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.450 
and that's about 180 198 bunnies
so<00:01:12.240> anything<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.229> applies<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> either<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
so anything that applies to either of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.999 
so anything that applies to either of
those<00:01:14.580> two<00:01:14.640> model<00:01:15.360> also<00:01:16.110> applies<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:19.009> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
those two model also applies to this so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.940 
those two model also applies to this so
compared<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> models<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.740> through

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
compared to models as well as go through

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.550 
compared to models as well as go through
the<00:01:23.040> facialist<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.170> way

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the facialist of this first up this way

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.789 
the facialist of this first up this way
is<00:01:25.759> considerably<00:01:26.759> more<00:01:27.000> than<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.080> blue<00:01:28.350> unit

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is considerably more than the blue unit

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
is considerably more than the blue unit
um<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> curse<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.509> vase<00:01:30.869> all

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
um this is got a curse on vase all

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.039 
um this is got a curse on vase all
around<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> just

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
around here or is this is just

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.780 
around here or is this is just
relatively<00:01:34.049> thin<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.530> bounces<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.520> these

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
relatively thin little bounces of these

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.630 
relatively thin little bounces of these
lines<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.570> heft<00:01:36.930> us

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
lines it's got a bit more heft us

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.600 
lines it's got a bit more heft us
although<00:01:38.640> they're<00:01:39.060> both<00:01:39.619> 375<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.920> motors

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
although they're both 375 what motors

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
although they're both 375 what motors
the<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:43.350> unit<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.770> considerably

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the one in this unit is considerably

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
the one in this unit is considerably
more<00:01:44.729> powerful<00:01:45.380> seem<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> lot<00:01:46.799> more

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
more powerful seem to have a lot more

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.929 
more powerful seem to have a lot more
talking<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:48.560> Belden<00:01:49.560> discs<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.670> slow

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
talking the Belden discs in not to slow

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.230 
talking the Belden discs in not to slow
down<00:01:51.119> half<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.810> much<00:01:52.820> faster<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> disc

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
down half as much faster on the disc

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.810 
down half as much faster on the disc
here<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.590> small<00:01:56.070> disc<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.579> only

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
here is not as it is small disc is only

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.709 
here is not as it is small disc is only
150<00:01:57.509> ml<00:01:58.009> 200<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.219> 300<00:01:59.759> mil<00:01:59.969> disc<00:02:00.270> would<00:02:00.450> be<00:02:00.540> much

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
150 ml 200 or 300 mil disc would be much

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.850 
150 ml 200 or 300 mil disc would be much
nicer<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> pay<00:02:02.549> for

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
nicer but you get what you pay for

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.580 
nicer but you get what you pay for
so<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.070> means

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
so that means

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
so that means
that<00:02:07.590> means<00:02:07.800> adding<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> curve<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.880> piece<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that means adding a curve to piece of

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.950 
that means adding a curve to piece of
work

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
work

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.840 
work
just<00:02:10.590> getting<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.220> nice<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.400> flat<00:02:11.670> that's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
found the table is a better quality

find<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.190> tended<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.980> pull<00:02:37.980> out<00:02:38.190> too

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
find that this tended to pull out too

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.650 
find that this tended to pull out too
easily<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.890> interesting<00:02:41.850> thing<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
easily the interesting thing is that the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.530 
easily the interesting thing is that the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.170 
miter bar on the cheapy on the old unit
is<00:02:45.660> actually<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.020> little<00:02:46.140> bit<00:02:46.489> better<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.910> some

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
is actually a little bit better in some

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.490 
is actually a little bit better in some
ways<00:02:48.530> they're<00:02:49.530> both<00:02:49.770> iminium<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:52.070> plastic

gauge<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:55.830> it<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.510> T<00:02:57.750> track

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080

gauge on it but this is the T track
style<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.370> once<00:02:59.550> you<00:02:59.700> slot<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.270> in<00:03:02.600> can't

lift<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:04.020> does<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.680> bit<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.220> planar<00:03:05.489> but

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
lift it up does have a bit of planar but

you<00:03:06.300> can't<00:03:06.510> lift<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.380> one<00:03:07.560> you

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
you can't lift it up on this one you

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.110 
you can't lift it up on this one you
drop<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:09.480> can<00:03:09.600> move<00:03:11.000> simple<00:03:12.000> we're

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
what's good and bad on this as I said

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.280 
what's good and bad on this as I said
the<00:03:20.310> ryobi<00:03:20.610> model<00:03:21.000> life<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.420> reviews<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.989> and

the ryobi model life and reviews on and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.289 
the ryobi model life and reviews on and
anything<00:03:22.830> bad<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.549> all<00:03:23.820> good<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.269> that

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
anything bad on that all good on that

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.979 
anything bad on that all good on that
can<00:03:24.900> be<00:03:24.989> found<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.350> this<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.540> starting<00:03:27.900> from

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
can be found on this so starting from

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.900 
can be found on this so starting from
the<00:03:28.170> top<00:03:28.350> you've<00:03:28.560> got<00:03:28.590> actually<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.610> pretty

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the top you've got actually a pretty

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.810 
the top you've got actually a pretty
nice<00:03:30.060> guy<00:03:30.299> this<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.660> fairly<00:03:30.989> stable<00:03:31.340> it's<00:03:32.340> over

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
nice guy this is fairly stable it's over

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.110 
nice guy this is fairly stable it's over
this<00:03:32.970> table<00:03:33.420> whereas<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.200> old<00:03:34.320> model<00:03:34.829> wasn't

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
this table whereas the old model wasn't

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.490 
this table whereas the old model wasn't
so<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.540> jam<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.019> there<00:03:37.290> and

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
so that you can jam it up there and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.620 
so that you can jam it up there and
still<00:03:37.799> get<00:03:37.950> good<00:03:38.160> pressure<00:03:38.400> across<00:03:38.820> there

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
still get good pressure across there

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.470 
still get good pressure across there
these<00:03:40.140> are<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:40.380> valve<00:03:40.799> edges<00:03:41.250> which<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.850> much

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
these are now valve edges which is much

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.640 
these are now valve edges which is much
much<00:03:42.750> nicer<00:03:42.810> than<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> one<00:03:43.890> style<00:03:47.239> this<00:03:48.650> lets

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
much nicer than the one style this lets

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.350 
much nicer than the one style this lets
you<00:03:49.799> change<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.190> belt<00:03:50.459> by<00:03:50.610> releasing<00:03:51.030> tension

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
you change the belt by releasing tension

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.289 
you change the belt by releasing tension
but<00:03:51.660> there's<00:03:51.840> no<00:03:51.959> knob<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.910> fall<00:03:54.180> in

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
but there's no knob so if you fall in

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.390 
but there's no knob so if you fall in
that<00:03:54.329> this<00:03:54.600> slips<00:03:55.140> because<00:03:56.010> you're<00:03:56.250> trying

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
that this slips because you're trying

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.850 
that this slips because you're trying
too<00:03:56.640> much<00:03:56.670> pressure<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.209> whatever<00:03:57.860> there's

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
too much pressure and whatever there's

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.759 
too much pressure and whatever there's
nothing<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> do<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.970> fix<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:01.530> will

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
nothing to do to fix that this will

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.590 
nothing to do to fix that this will
adjust<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.340> tracking<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.030> can<00:04:03.180> make<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.360> go

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
adjust the tracking so you can make a go

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.100 
adjust the tracking so you can make a go
back<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.930> forth<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:04.320> it's<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.650> centered<00:04:07.070> and

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
back and forth if it's not centered and

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.030 
back and forth if it's not centered and
power<00:04:10.110> buttons

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
power buttons

power buttons
this<00:04:12.880> isn't<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.270> greatest<00:04:13.540> table<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:13.990> these

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
this isn't the greatest table of these

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.990 
this isn't the greatest table of these
better<00:04:14.380> than<00:04:14.590> what<00:04:14.709> they<00:04:14.830> had<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.700> can<00:04:15.849> see

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
better than what they had you can see

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.090 
better than what they had you can see
it's<00:04:16.120> got<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.359> zero<00:04:16.570> clearance<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.380> that's

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
it's got the zero clearance so that's

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.490 
it's got the zero clearance so that's
alright<00:04:18.579> until<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:19.030> change<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.540> angle<00:04:19.570> then

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
alright until you change the angle then

is that there is no weekend to indicate
zero<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.669> actually<00:04:42.910> tilt<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.330> back
