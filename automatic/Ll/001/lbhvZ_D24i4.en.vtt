00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
fret so so so nine ten nine it's kind of

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.420 
fret so so so nine ten nine it's kind of
hard<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.290> see<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.500> if<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.769> follow<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.250> tab

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
hard to see you if you follow on the tab

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.710 
hard to see you if you follow on the tab
you<00:03:24.459> can<00:03:24.639> see<00:03:24.819> how<00:03:24.940> I'm<00:03:25.000> doing<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:25.359> I'll<00:03:25.569> do

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you can see how I'm doing this I'll do

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.119 
you can see how I'm doing this I'll do
it<00:03:25.810> really<00:03:25.930> slow<00:03:26.139> at<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.349> end<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.949> it<00:03:27.040> goes<00:03:29.129> so

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
it really slow at the end and it goes so

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.920 
it really slow at the end and it goes so
again<00:03:30.340> we're<00:03:30.459> doing<00:03:30.519> this<00:03:30.639> same<00:03:30.910> thing<00:03:33.930> now

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
again we're doing this same thing now

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.420 
again we're doing this same thing now
use<00:03:35.169> your<00:03:35.290> third<00:03:35.440> finger<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.769> slide<00:03:35.980> back<00:03:36.280> from

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
use your third finger to slide back from

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.369 
use your third finger to slide back from
seven<00:03:36.699> to<00:03:36.760> five<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.750> then<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.109> with<00:03:41.230> my

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
seven to five and then I go with my

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.960 
seven to five and then I go with my
third<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.889> use<00:03:42.010> my<00:03:42.159> third<00:03:42.340> finger<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.609> slide<00:03:42.760> up

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
third I use my third finger to slide up

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.649 
third I use my third finger to slide up
so<00:03:43.060> I'm<00:03:43.120> gonna<00:03:43.239> go<00:03:43.359> three<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.109> five<00:03:45.659> right

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
so I'm gonna go three to five right

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.979 
so I'm gonna go three to five right
there

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
there

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:53.420 
there
I'll<00:03:47.079> turn<00:03:47.229> this<00:03:47.349> this<00:03:47.500> way<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> little<00:03:47.739> bit<00:03:47.859> so

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.440 

like<00:03:54.430> that

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.059 

so<00:03:59.450> that's<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.349> basically<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.740> whole<00:04:00.860> thing

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
so that's the basically the whole thing

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.380 
so that's the basically the whole thing
through<00:04:01.280> it's<00:04:01.490> kind<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.819> tricky<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.090> show<00:04:02.330> you

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
through it's kind of tricky to show you

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.300 
through it's kind of tricky to show you
but<00:04:02.599> I<00:04:02.810> thought<00:04:03.260> I'd<00:04:03.410> give<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.530> slow<00:04:03.830> version<00:04:04.069> of

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
but I thought I'd give a slow version of

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.400 
but I thought I'd give a slow version of
it<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.430> see<00:04:04.700> how<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.849> play<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.060> ago<00:04:05.300> so<00:04:06.290> I'll

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
it to see how you play this ago so I'll

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:43.200 
it to see how you play this ago so I'll
play<00:04:06.560> through<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:06.860> whole<00:04:06.950> way<00:04:07.069> slow

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.790 

and<00:04:43.449> then<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.080> goes<00:04:44.169> written<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.560> c-sharp

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
and then that goes written a c-sharp

00:04:44.800 --> 00:05:07.719 
and then that goes written a c-sharp
minor<00:04:45.210> so<00:04:46.210> I'll<00:04:46.270> do<00:04:46.419> a<00:04:46.449> quick<00:04:46.600> now

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.700 

so<00:05:08.729> that<00:05:08.970> helps<00:05:09.210> you<00:05:09.300> at<00:05:09.510> home<00:05:09.660> let<00:05:09.960> me<00:05:10.110> know<00:05:10.260> if

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
so that helps you at home let me know if

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.110 
so that helps you at home let me know if
not<00:05:11.010> if<00:05:11.160> you<00:05:11.250> have<00:05:11.400> any<00:05:11.520> ways<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:11.820> can<00:05:11.940> improve

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
not if you have any ways I can improve

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.540
