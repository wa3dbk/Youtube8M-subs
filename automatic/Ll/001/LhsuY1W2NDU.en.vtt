00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.889
 [Music] 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.630
 For many owners, the question arises 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.219
 after cats such is always great 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.629
 everywhere dogs were like at 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.969
 cats own that makes the whole 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.150
 thing so dangerous so it's a few 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.679
 virus that means it goes on that means 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.119
 not that the few virus in itself 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.099
 from the dog to the cat but that goes 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.919
 few videos that the cats they are such 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.259
 triggers is for dogs as well 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.790
 for cats dangerous to deadly so 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.860
 in most cases fatal, it 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.910
 is a very heavy high 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.989
 feverish diarrhea and 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.329
 gastrointestinal diseases the cats 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.579
 really blood is coming back too 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.989
 blood out there is terribly bad 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.870
 and most of them are still dying 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.910
 within a week in total 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 of course the little ones again 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.089
 young cats and the old cats more 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.059
 endangered as the normal cats so 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.780
 the 1-18 years old who are 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.330
 not so dangerously endangered that is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.340
 also a very very persistent virus 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.829
 you get it scary it simply 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.659
 as said before, the dogs will run outside 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.549
 I can walk around through it 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.110
 after a few days not see if 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.390
 the dust that I'm watching right now 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 Run and the sand maybe because one 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.610
 HundhÃ¤ufchen was or a 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.549
 cash cottage 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.840
 I carry with my streets that carries 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.659
 virus in the apartment 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 the card can record it there by 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.229
 Just on your shoes 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.970
 sniffs and maybe afterwards 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.009
 cleans and so the virus on that is 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.439
 home cats as endangered as 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.579
 cats are outside 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.219
 therefore there is always an inoculation 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.750
 to advise so there are not too 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.530
 vaccinating is really a bit like that 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.270
 gepokert 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.040
 It is also still before we had 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.110
 in our practice this year 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.030
 already two cases with parvovirose it 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.219
 Both puppies were from the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.079
 may come from abroad may mean nothing 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.579
 You can still do it in the meantime 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.350
 to have been outside before that 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.899
 has broken out and a heap 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 stopped and then it just stops 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.450
 really take care of his running
