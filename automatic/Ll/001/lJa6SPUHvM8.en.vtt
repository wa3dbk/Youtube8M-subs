let's take a look at it so this weapon

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.609 
let's take a look at it so this weapon
is<00:01:01.440> basically<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.129> sniper<00:01:02.969> rifle<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.260> an

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
extremely long range and it's also very

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.070 
extremely long range and it's also very
very<00:01:08.340> accurate<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> primary<00:01:10.700> firing<00:01:11.700> mode

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
very accurate on the primary firing mode

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.660 
very accurate on the primary firing mode
but<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.010> careful<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
because they only holds three bullets

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.149 
because they only holds three bullets
and<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:18.299> alternative<00:01:18.750> alternative<00:01:19.439> firing

and the alternative alternative firing
mode<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.520> pretty<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.360> line<00:01:21.780> gun<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.840> very

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
mode is pretty much a line gun so very

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.800
