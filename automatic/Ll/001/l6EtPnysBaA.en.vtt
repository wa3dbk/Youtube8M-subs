00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.310 
you've got other collections and then
you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.479> go<00:01:42.600> through<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.960> look<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.170> your

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you can go through and look at your

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
you can go through and look at your
action<00:01:43.740> movies<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.070> again<00:01:44.310> each<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> these

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
action movies and again each of these

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.069 
action movies and again each of these
things<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> takes<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> moment<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> add

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
things it takes a moment for it to add

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
things it takes a moment for it to add
it<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.740> again<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.130> going

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it up there because again you're going

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.670 
it up there because again you're going
through<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> internet<00:01:48.180> user<00:01:48.479> interface<00:01:49.079> but

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
through the internet user interface but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.749 
through the internet user interface but
you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.070> doesn't<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.369> take<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you can see it doesn't really take that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.609 
you can see it doesn't really take that
long<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> find<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.320> want<00:01:52.590> to

watch<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.369> simply<00:01:53.759> would<00:01:53.909> click<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:57.170> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
watch you simply would click on it and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230
