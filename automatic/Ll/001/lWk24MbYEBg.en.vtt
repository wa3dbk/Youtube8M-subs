CBA 3 i'm going to run this at ten ants
but<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.240> parallel<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.439> see<00:00:22.619> i

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
but in parallel to that you can see i

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.820 
but in parallel to that you can see i
have<00:00:22.710> these<00:00:22.949> two<00:00:23.189> jumper<00:00:23.730> cable<00:00:24.180> set<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.260> to

have these two jumper cable set on to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.810 
have these two jumper cable set on to
the<00:00:26.430> tabs<00:00:27.230> they're<00:00:28.230> hooked<00:00:29.220> up<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.640> with

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the tabs they're hooked up there with

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.680 
the tabs they're hooked up there with
some<00:00:29.939> aluminum<00:00:30.449> clamps<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.910> they're<00:00:32.910> sitting

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
some aluminum clamps and they're sitting

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260 
some aluminum clamps and they're sitting
here<00:00:33.930> ready<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> go<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.890> instead<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> load

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
here ready to go and instead of the load

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
here ready to go and instead of the load
that<00:00:36.690> i<00:00:36.960> checked<00:00:37.440> them<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.770> before<00:00:37.950> i'm<00:00:38.550> going

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that i checked them on before i'm going

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.830 
that i checked them on before i'm going
to<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.000> dead<00:00:39.360> short<00:00:39.750> them<00:00:39.870> I've<00:00:40.860> done<00:00:41.370> some

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
to just dead short them I've done some

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.750 
to just dead short them I've done some
tests<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> have<00:00:43.260> an<00:00:43.350> idea<00:00:43.579> what<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
tests and I have an idea what the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.510 
tests and I have an idea what the
resistance<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.690> these<00:00:45.840> cables<00:00:46.520> predicting

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
resistance is in these cables predicting

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
resistance is in these cables predicting
it<00:00:47.730> should<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.120> somewhere<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:48.660> 200<00:00:49.200> amps

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it should be somewhere over 200 amps

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.369 
it should be somewhere over 200 amps
draw<00:00:50.600> I<00:00:52.039> may<00:00:53.039> try<00:00:53.789> similar<00:00:54.270> tests<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:55.020> some

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
draw I may try similar tests with some

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
draw I may try similar tests with some
of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> others<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.250> stack<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
of the others you see I got a stack of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.390 
of the others you see I got a stack of
these<00:00:56.969> cells

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.080 

and<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.970> couple<00:01:00.150> more<00:01:00.450> stacks<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.080> these<00:01:01.230> cells

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
and a couple more stacks of these cells

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.220 
and a couple more stacks of these cells
that<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.360> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.540> try<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> build<00:01:03.990> some

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
that I'm going to try to build some

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.550 
that I'm going to try to build some
batteries<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:06.020> if<00:01:07.020> everything<00:01:07.290> goes

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
batteries with and if everything goes

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.210 
batteries with and if everything goes
according<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.100> plan<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:08.760> should<00:01:09.740> see<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.980> just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
according to plan we should see in just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.860 
according to plan we should see in just
a<00:01:11.430> second<00:01:12.380> what's<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> happen<00:01:14.160> here<00:01:14.870> so

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
a second what's going to happen here so

let me go ahead and I don't know if you
can<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.680> computer<00:01:20.160> screen<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.910> i'm

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
can see that computer screen but i'm

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.460 
can see that computer screen but i'm
about<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:22.550> start<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.910> cba<00:01:24.360> three<00:01:24.870> run<00:01:25.170> into

see 3.29 bolts so insperity sagging this
is<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.659> 20s<00:02:00.200> our<00:02:00.440> capacity<00:02:01.100> battery<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:04.659> now

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
is a 20s our capacity battery and now

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.880 
is a 20s our capacity battery and now
comes<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.470> big<00:02:06.680> test<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:09.350> going<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.709> take

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
comes the big test is going to take

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.540 
comes the big test is going to take
these<00:02:10.100> cables<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:13.010> might<00:02:13.190> not<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.520> able

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
these cables and you might not be able

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.309 
these cables and you might not be able
to<00:02:13.760> see<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.239> when<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.170> i'm

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
to see you this when I do it but i'm

to see you this when I do it but i'm
just<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:15.880> plant<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> other

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.520 

and<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.870> doesn't<00:02:32.379> seem<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> be<00:02:32.980> doing<00:02:33.159> much

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.340 

there<00:02:39.069> you<00:02:39.220> go<00:02:39.370> i<00:02:39.400> think<00:02:39.760> i<00:02:39.880> got<00:02:40.060> some<00:02:40.959> current

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
there you go i think i got some current

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.309 
there you go i think i got some current
draw<00:02:42.300> okay<00:02:43.300> they're<00:02:43.480> dead<00:02:43.660> sure<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.140> now

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
draw okay they're dead sure it is now

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.040 
draw okay they're dead sure it is now
you<00:02:44.620> see<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> line<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:49.120> has<00:02:49.390> dropped<00:02:49.750> down

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
you see the line and it has dropped down

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.750 
you see the line and it has dropped down
to<00:02:50.350> right<00:02:51.190> now<00:02:52.830> 2.89<00:02:53.940> bolts<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:56.430> we'll<00:02:57.430> check

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
to right now 2.89 bolts so we'll check

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.270 
to right now 2.89 bolts so we'll check
the<00:02:58.209> capacity<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.140> i'm<00:02:59.800> holding<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the capacity of this i'm holding the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.400 
the capacity of this i'm holding the
cables<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.819> my<00:03:00.940> hand<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.330> feel<00:03:01.600> for<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:02.230> get

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
cables in my hand to feel for they get

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.770 
cables in my hand to feel for they get
too<00:03:02.620> hot<00:03:02.650> i<00:03:03.190> might<00:03:03.489> have<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.670> stop<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.209> test

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.130 

let's<00:03:07.780> watch<00:03:07.989> this<00:03:08.380> still<00:03:09.010> holding<00:03:09.360> 2.87<00:03:10.360> we

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
let's watch this still holding 2.87 we

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.199 
let's watch this still holding 2.87 we
would<00:03:11.320> expect<00:03:11.709> for<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.070> dead<00:03:12.400> short<00:03:12.670> test<00:03:13.000> like

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
would expect for a dead short test like

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.290 
would expect for a dead short test like
this<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.660> have<00:03:13.870> some<00:03:14.290> voltage<00:03:14.830> sag<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:16.090> these

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
this to have some voltage sag in these

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.350 
this to have some voltage sag in these
cells<00:03:16.600> but<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.050> have<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.410> say<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.910> holding

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
cells but I have to say it's holding

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.009 
cells but I have to say it's holding
very<00:03:20.350> close<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.890> 33<00:03:21.760> volts<00:03:22.209> which<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.750> pretty

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
very close to 33 volts which is pretty

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.550 
very close to 33 volts which is pretty
good<00:03:24.269> when<00:03:25.269> we're<00:03:25.420> done<00:03:25.450> we'll<00:03:25.780> calculate<00:03:26.019> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
good when we're done we'll calculate the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.100 
good when we're done we'll calculate the
ants<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:27.220> I'll<00:03:27.340> write<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:27.970> down<00:03:28.870> somewhere

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
ants and I'll write that down somewhere

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.020 
ants and I'll write that down somewhere
and<00:03:29.670> post<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.910> with<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> video<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.700> holding

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
and post it with the video so holding

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.110 
and post it with the video so holding
2.87<00:03:34.900> volts<00:03:35.440> nice<00:03:35.709> flat<00:03:36.310> discharge<00:03:36.970> curve

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
2.87 volts nice flat discharge curve

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.650 
2.87 volts nice flat discharge curve
we're<00:03:40.120> at<00:03:40.360> we<00:03:40.810> started<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.380> test<00:03:41.650> at<00:03:42.660> 1.1

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
we're at we started to test at 1.1

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.370 
we're at we started to test at 1.1
minutes<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:45.540> we're<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:46.660> going<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.959> watch

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
minutes and we're just going to watch

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.110 
minutes and we're just going to watch
this<00:03:47.709> graph<00:03:48.100> go<00:03:48.519> for<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:48.940> couple<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.360> minutes

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.559 

I<00:03:53.209> would<00:03:53.750> expect<00:03:54.200> it's<00:03:54.440> going<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:55.209> last<00:03:56.209> no

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
I would expect it's going to last no

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.100 
I would expect it's going to last no
more<00:03:56.870> than<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:58.269> couple<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.450> minutes<00:03:59.599> at<00:03:59.959> this

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
more than a couple of minutes at this

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.140 
more than a couple of minutes at this
current<00:04:00.470> let's<00:04:00.920> see<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.250> say<00:04:01.730> we're<00:04:02.030> getting

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
current let's see it say we're getting

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.670 
current let's see it say we're getting
200<00:04:02.840> amps<00:04:03.260> like<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:03.799> think<00:04:03.980> we're<00:04:04.250> getting

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
200 amps like we think we're getting

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.160 
200 amps like we think we're getting
then<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:07.310> should<00:04:07.610> actually<00:04:08.180> could<00:04:08.690> go<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:09.049> long

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
then it should actually could go as long

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.210 
then it should actually could go as long
as<00:04:09.319> 10<00:04:09.560> minutes<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.459> may<00:04:11.390> have<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.659> end<00:04:11.840> this

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
as 10 minutes so I may have to end this

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.979 
as 10 minutes so I may have to end this
before<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.700> but<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.030> just<00:04:14.239> want<00:04:14.450> I'm<00:04:14.599> ready<00:04:14.810> to

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
before that but I just want I'm ready to

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.180 
before that but I just want I'm ready to
see<00:04:15.200> these<00:04:16.510> cells<00:04:17.510> can<00:04:18.049> handle<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.650> dead<00:04:18.859> short

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
see these cells can handle a dead short

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.300 
see these cells can handle a dead short
and<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:20.780> don't<00:04:20.959> believe<00:04:21.049> me<00:04:21.380> there's<00:04:21.949> the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
and you don't believe me there's the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.529 
and you don't believe me there's the
jumper<00:04:22.639> cables<00:04:23.380> hooked<00:04:24.380> up<00:04:25.210> right<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.389> each

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
jumper cables hooked up right to each

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.010 
jumper cables hooked up right to each
other<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:28.060> coming<00:04:29.060> right<00:04:29.240> off<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.630> tabs<00:04:29.870> of

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
other and coming right off the tabs of

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.070 
other and coming right off the tabs of
that<00:04:30.169> battery<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.400> don't<00:04:32.330> forget<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.630> CBA

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
that battery and don't forget the CBA

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.590 
that battery and don't forget the CBA
three<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.889> drawing<00:04:34.250> 10s<00:04:34.639> itself<00:04:35.090> now<00:04:35.479> I'm

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
three is drawing 10s itself now I'm

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.969 
three is drawing 10s itself now I'm
starting<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:35.930> feel<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.169> wire<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.800> get<00:04:36.949> a

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
starting to feel a wire just get a

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.730 
starting to feel a wire just get a
little<00:04:37.130> bit<00:04:37.370> warm<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.870> probably<00:04:39.440> what<00:04:39.590> I'm

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
little bit warm so probably what I'm

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.420 
little bit warm so probably what I'm
going<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:39.949> do<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:41.110> before<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.620> start<00:04:42.949> generating

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
going to do is before I start generating

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.370 
going to do is before I start generating
smoke<00:04:43.910> in<00:04:44.150> my<00:04:44.270> house<00:04:44.539> and<00:04:44.960> have<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.169> get<00:04:45.289> the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
smoke in my house and have to get the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.900 
smoke in my house and have to get the
fire<00:04:45.650> extinguisher<00:04:45.680> I'm<00:04:46.460> just<00:04:46.580> going<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.820> go

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
fire extinguisher I'm just going to go

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.189 
fire extinguisher I'm just going to go
ahead<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.330> end<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.440> test<00:04:48.850> but<00:04:49.850> look<00:04:50.199> one

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
ahead and end the test but look one

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.379 
ahead and end the test but look one
thing<00:04:51.380> I<00:04:51.470> want<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.650> see<00:04:51.889> is<00:04:51.949> actually<00:04:52.389> the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
thing I want to see is actually the

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.710 
thing I want to see is actually the
voltage<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.800> 2.87<00:04:55.639> before<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.479> it's

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
voltage is it 2.87 before and it's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.370 
voltage is it 2.87 before and it's
actually<00:04:57.050> gone<00:04:57.200> up<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.770> 2.91<00:04:58.990> while<00:04:59.990> this

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
actually gone up the 2.91 while this

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.000 
actually gone up the 2.91 while this
test<00:05:01.010> is<00:05:01.190> going<00:05:01.460> on<00:05:01.729> so<00:05:02.229> that<00:05:03.229> may<00:05:03.500> be<00:05:03.530> due<00:05:03.979> to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
test is going on so that may be due to

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.760 
test is going on so that may be due to
the<00:05:04.340> fact<00:05:04.550> that<00:05:04.789> the<00:05:05.229> cables<00:05:06.229> are<00:05:06.320> getting<00:05:06.590> hot

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
the fact that the cables are getting hot

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.260 
the fact that the cables are getting hot
and<00:05:06.950> generating<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.639> little<00:05:08.000> bit<00:05:08.120> more

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
and generating a little bit more

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.409 
and generating a little bit more
resistance<00:05:08.870> and<00:05:09.580> that's<00:05:10.580> lowering<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
resistance and that's lowering the

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.920 
resistance and that's lowering the
current<00:05:12.070> but<00:05:13.070> pretty<00:05:13.610> interesting<00:05:14.090> test<00:05:14.330> I'm

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
current but pretty interesting test I'm

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.990 
current but pretty interesting test I'm
starting<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.410> smell<00:05:15.650> some<00:05:15.950> insulation<00:05:16.400> now<00:05:16.729> so

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
starting to smell some insulation now so

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.700 
starting to smell some insulation now so
I'm<00:05:17.090> going<00:05:17.240> to<00:05:17.300> unhook<00:05:17.690> these<00:05:17.900> cables<00:05:18.470> and

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
I'm going to unhook these cables and

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:29.370 
I'm going to unhook these cables and
we'll<00:05:19.520> see<00:05:19.729> what<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.120> rest<00:05:20.270> of<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.570> test<00:05:20.780> does

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.220 

okay<00:05:29.740> we're<00:05:29.920> unhooked<00:05:33.120> graph<00:05:34.120> goes<00:05:34.420> back<00:05:34.900> to

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
okay we're unhooked graph goes back to

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:47.250 
okay we're unhooked graph goes back to
our<00:05:38.230> on<00:05:40.680> 3.17<00:05:41.680> bolts<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:43.000> holding<00:05:43.810> steady<00:05:46.260> so

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
our on 3.17 bolts and holding steady so

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.700 
our on 3.17 bolts and holding steady so
that<00:05:47.680> hold<00:05:48.930> like<00:05:49.930> i<00:05:50.020> said<00:05:50.230> i<00:05:50.260> estimated

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
that hold like i said i estimated

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.680 
that hold like i said i estimated
resistance<00:05:51.340> before<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.820> I<00:05:51.880> expect<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.390> was

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
resistance before and I expect that was

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.980 
resistance before and I expect that was
somewhere<00:05:53.230> over<00:05:53.470> 200<00:05:53.980> amps<00:05:54.310> at<00:05:54.460> this<00:05:54.610> point

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
somewhere over 200 amps at this point

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.750 
somewhere over 200 amps at this point
they're<00:05:55.990> rated<00:05:56.230> at<00:05:56.530> six<00:05:56.860> hundred<00:05:57.160> amps<00:05:57.520> and

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
they're rated at six hundred amps and

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.560 
they're rated at six hundred amps and
there's<00:05:58.000> some<00:05:58.180> tests<00:05:58.810> you<00:05:58.930> can<00:05:58.960> see<00:06:00.090> not<00:06:01.090> by<00:06:01.300> me

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
there's some tests you can see not by me

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
there's some tests you can see not by me
where<00:06:02.200> they've<00:06:02.410> done<00:06:02.970> high<00:06:03.970> current<00:06:04.510> draw<00:06:05.440> us

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
where they've done high current draw us

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.830 
where they've done high current draw us
like<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.980> but<00:06:07.620> I'd<00:06:08.620> say<00:06:08.830> on<00:06:09.010> all<00:06:09.420> these<00:06:10.420> cells

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
like that but I'd say on all these cells

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.140 
like that but I'd say on all these cells
are<00:06:11.200> pretty<00:06:11.650> good<00:06:12.690> at<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.720> very<00:06:14.230> high<00:06:14.400> 200<00:06:15.400> +<00:06:15.580> +

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
are pretty good at a very high 200 + +

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.020 
are pretty good at a very high 200 + +
aunt<00:06:16.540> load<00:06:16.810> which<00:06:17.140> I<00:06:17.290> shall<00:06:17.560> calculate

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
aunt load which I shall calculate

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.780 
aunt load which I shall calculate
shortly<00:06:19.030> that<00:06:19.960> if<00:06:20.710> I'm<00:06:20.950> able<00:06:21.190> to<00:06:21.370> do<00:06:21.610> that

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
shortly that if I'm able to do that

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.740 
shortly that if I'm able to do that
based<00:06:22.180> on<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:22.510> resistance<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.140> the<00:06:23.260> cables

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
based on the resistance of the cables

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.400 
based on the resistance of the cables
that<00:06:25.750> I<00:06:26.460> estimated<00:06:27.460> previously<00:06:28.120> okay<00:06:29.110> it's

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
that I estimated previously okay it's

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.230 
that I estimated previously okay it's
going<00:06:29.860> to<00:06:29.890> end<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.160> test<00:06:30.430> we're<00:06:30.760> back<00:06:30.940> up<00:06:31.120> at

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
going to end the test we're back up at

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:37.980 
going to end the test we're back up at
3.21<00:06:32.140> bolts<00:06:32.770> and<00:06:33.060> still<00:06:34.470> nice<00:06:35.470> and<00:06:35.500> flat
