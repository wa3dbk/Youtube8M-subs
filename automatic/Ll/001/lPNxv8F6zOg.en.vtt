 I had learned a kilo that is demanding but not just the one 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.949
 point in the right direction 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.460

 fire 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.080
 from the spot 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.940
 that one kilo that is a challenging track Bruckbauer behind 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.180
 and I can find 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.279
 APA the flowerpots 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.639
 not everybody has 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.900
 this is a demanding tiger i have the team thats me 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.900

 if at all feasible 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.229
 but I am 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.499
 that is a 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.000
 dpa from the table and then 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.710

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.889
 8th 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.990
 I noticed another form of the tiger that is a demanding one 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.759
 Claim the courts do not dominate 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.759
 that I just do not even have water and plenty of terrain is always his credo 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.020
 and now came 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020

 Tigers is a farmer who uses the farm throughout 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.290

 Lastly, that's my goal 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.770
 unlike Dr, I can stretch out my arm 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.770
