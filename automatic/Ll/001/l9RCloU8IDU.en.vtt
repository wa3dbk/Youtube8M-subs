00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.119 

my<00:06:30.989> biggest<00:06:31.199> problem<00:06:31.499> with<00:06:31.559> this<00:06:31.679> section<00:06:32.009> is

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:32.129 
my biggest problem with this section is

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:35.569 
my biggest problem with this section is
that<00:06:32.249> it's<00:06:32.429> just<00:06:32.729> simply<00:06:33.059> too<00:06:33.269> long<00:06:33.979> yeah<00:06:34.979> I

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:35.579 
that it's just simply too long yeah I

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:36.079 
that it's just simply too long yeah I
agree

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.089 
agree

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:40.449 
agree
just<00:06:36.629> like<00:06:36.749> the<00:06:36.899> griffon<00:06:37.110> section<00:06:37.679> in<00:06:38.119> earlier

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:40.459 
just like the griffon section in earlier

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:42.949 
just like the griffon section in earlier
the<00:06:41.459> Griffin<00:06:41.789> section<00:06:42.149> I<00:06:42.239> kind<00:06:42.539> of<00:06:42.629> find<00:06:42.869> a

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:42.959 
the Griffin section I kind of find a

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.299 
the Griffin section I kind of find a
little<00:06:43.199> bit<00:06:43.289> more<00:06:43.439> offensive<00:06:43.829> personally

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:44.309 
little bit more offensive personally

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:46.789 
little bit more offensive personally
simply<00:06:45.209> due<00:06:45.360> to<00:06:45.389> the<00:06:45.509> fact<00:06:45.539> that<00:06:45.869> the<00:06:46.499> Griffin

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:46.799 
simply due to the fact that the Griffin

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:49.489 
simply due to the fact that the Griffin
section<00:06:47.299> has<00:06:48.299> so<00:06:48.719> many<00:06:48.899> spots<00:06:49.139> where<00:06:49.409> you're

00:06:49.489 --> 00:06:49.499 
section has so many spots where you're

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:51.589 
section has so many spots where you're
sitting<00:06:49.769> there<00:06:49.889> doing<00:06:50.069> nothing<00:06:50.219> and<00:06:50.999> all<00:06:51.239> and

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 
sitting there doing nothing and all and

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.389 
sitting there doing nothing and all and
you're<00:06:51.989> just<00:06:52.169> watching<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.559> pretty<00:06:52.799> graphics

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:53.399 
you're just watching the pretty graphics

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.909 
you're just watching the pretty graphics
fly<00:06:53.669> on<00:06:53.849> by<00:06:54.059> at<00:06:54.719> least<00:06:55.139> in<00:06:55.379> this<00:06:55.469> one<00:06:55.709> you<00:06:55.829> were

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
fly on by at least in this one you were

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.559 
fly on by at least in this one you were
consistently<00:06:56.549> fighting<00:06:56.819> having<00:06:57.299> to<00:06:57.389> deal

00:06:57.559 --> 00:06:57.569 
consistently fighting having to deal

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:01.459 
consistently fighting having to deal
with<00:06:57.599> health<00:06:58.289> and<00:06:59.059> at<00:07:00.059> least<00:07:00.239> that<00:07:00.479> the<00:07:01.019> threat

00:07:01.459 --> 00:07:01.469 
with health and at least that the threat

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:04.519 
with health and at least that the threat
of<00:07:01.499> that<00:07:01.709> tally<00:07:02.069> getting<00:07:02.459> too<00:07:02.639> high<00:07:03.379> right<00:07:04.379> I

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:04.529 
of that tally getting too high right I

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:06.319 
of that tally getting too high right I
don't<00:07:05.039> know<00:07:05.099> there's<00:07:05.309> at<00:07:05.519> least<00:07:05.549> something<00:07:06.149> to

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:06.329 
don't know there's at least something to

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:08.209 
don't know there's at least something to
do<00:07:06.659> in<00:07:06.869> this<00:07:06.989> section<00:07:07.259> wallet<00:07:07.769> while<00:07:08.039> I<00:07:08.099> do

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:08.219 
do in this section wallet while I do

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:10.039 
do in this section wallet while I do
agree<00:07:08.639> with<00:07:08.729> you<00:07:08.879> that<00:07:08.999> it<00:07:09.329> does<00:07:09.479> go<00:07:09.689> way<00:07:09.989> too

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:10.049 
agree with you that it does go way too

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:12.859 
agree with you that it does go way too
long<00:07:10.439> I<00:07:10.799> think<00:07:11.579> we<00:07:11.699> clocked<00:07:11.969> it<00:07:12.179> like<00:07:12.389> 15

00:07:12.859 --> 00:07:12.869 
long I think we clocked it like 15

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:15.259 
long I think we clocked it like 15
minutes<00:07:13.199> or<00:07:13.319> so<00:07:13.559> that's<00:07:14.519> that's<00:07:14.939> pretty

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:15.269 
minutes or so that's that's pretty

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:19.009 
minutes or so that's that's pretty
ridiculous<00:07:15.749> but<00:07:16.229> I<00:07:17.209> still<00:07:18.209> prefer<00:07:18.360> it<00:07:18.749> to<00:07:18.779> the

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:19.019 
ridiculous but I still prefer it to the

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:24.429 
ridiculous but I still prefer it to the
little<00:07:19.469> Panzer<00:07:20.039> Dragoon<00:07:20.219> section

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:24.439
