00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.840 
only can come so this one is much
lighter<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.209> maybe<00:02:59.420> that's<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.750> different

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
lighter so maybe that's a different

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.340 
lighter so maybe that's a different
flower<00:03:03.100> different<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.959> that's<00:03:06.140> two

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
flower different but that's two

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.820 
flower different but that's two
different<00:03:06.980> but<00:03:07.519> it's<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.090> same<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.560> when<00:03:09.739> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
different but it's the same so when you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.070 
different but it's the same so when you
grind<00:03:10.130> them<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.700> peel<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.420> then<00:03:12.250> then<00:03:13.250> I

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
grind them so I peel and then then I

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.350 
grind them so I peel and then then I
took<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.380> skin<00:03:15.650> off<00:03:15.820> because<00:03:16.820> otherwise<00:03:17.030> you

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
took the skin off because otherwise you

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.420 
took the skin off because otherwise you
get<00:03:17.480> very<00:03:17.750> very<00:03:18.019> brown<00:03:18.410> if<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.769> get<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.100> skin

get very very brown if you get the skin

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.190 
get very very brown if you get the skin
