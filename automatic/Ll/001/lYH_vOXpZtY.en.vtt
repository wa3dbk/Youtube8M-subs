00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:10.580
 Well then that child's xv 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.170
 It is a dvd but pet 17,000 is what 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.620
 While to see 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:21.200
 I think let's characteristically described little by little 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:23.810
 This is No you both that Blu-ray and it is the avatar that you know dvd 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.070
 First of all from dvd 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.070
 In the wind like I was looking 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.080
 the burden 25 days 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.080
 Masu Tei to play from their own 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.610
 Though I'm 17,000 features or say this is I mackerel xv 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 Well the brightness is Victor's elx is ah 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.280
 1300 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.200
 Sony's 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 30 Jesus 1300 v dark Lumpur 92 s to connect to 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.630
 The song 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.760
 That bright of features and are taking this z 17,000 Hano 1000 and monitoring lumens 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.940
 is 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.280
 Naa catalog plant is Comte story with 40,000 other rate 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.280
 a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.220
 Toka 50,000-to-1 Victor x3 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:33.000
 That's right bw 90 es 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:37.950
 Although it is near the 150,000th position, this is actually the case of that projection on the screen 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.570
 It says this child tiger sweet is I'd difference of most white and most black 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.370
 In short, it is impossible to project black without a screen, and on the screen 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.460
 There is no need to project pure white 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:56.369
 The screen is always black and it is that aging 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.890
 The light on the projector that has been projected on the light science screen is reflected 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.040
 Will brighten the room 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:10.229
 It Tteyuu the fact that in the Fair has become bright is the obvious one cream bright 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.479
 Screen as long as you are watching the video in the projector is in the black door it does not become absolutely 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.150
 say 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.500
 If close to zero as possible is, for example is the black part of Tteyuu this contrast is referred to as 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.269
 The closer you get 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:28.120
 This ratio will increase, for example , Sony of this line ansi Lumen 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.870
 The projector is 150,000 thali child, but this is temporarily after the war how many figures are 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.470
 if there is 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.820
 It is said that it will be 150,000 one 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:40.670
 It's a matter of course but the projection of the image with a line ansi lumen projector 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.770
 The screen is reflected in the bright light of the room when you are 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.790
 that 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:51.040
 It's become a little more bright Toka 1 ansi lumen and crab ansi lumens 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.760
 So also said the contrast of the image to be projected as with any projector 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.819
 Is I do not even roughly woman that Sendai say 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:04.150
 So that's on the data of the projector 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:11.379
 If the contrast princess on the catalog is about more than just the first one, then it will be soft 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:14.750
 I do not know that fraud is more than it is actually reproduction of color and reproduction 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:20.990
 Those who like the black rose when projecting 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:25.450
 It is very wrong to choose a projector with good contrast because 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:28.750
 I would like you to be careful as this is an act 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:33.590
 Besides this projector is bright 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.900
 using a small mirror of the hole reflection type called dlp 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.599
 I use that element 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:46.610
 Unlike the stationmaster that the projector uses of the this that that the Tteyuu reflection type was 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:48.520
 I moved a small Mia lightly in August 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.500
 Do not thank thank 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.610
 Tracking speed is very fast because it adjusts the brightness of the image 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:01.380
 If it is 3d then that 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.890
 If this switching speed is slow 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.310
 Since afterimage remains, rushing speed 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:12.270
 Love that is switched does not show a picture, that is, a picture 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.220
 It is necessary to stop desperately, but the place is dlb 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.630
 In that blue team speed the case of dlp is the very fast 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.920
 That light is completely effective 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:29.170
 If you use 3d you can use 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:33.820
 The problem is the light but with this Sharp's z 17,000 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:37.540
 In addition to being originally bright with 1600 ansi lumens 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.650
 The switching speed is very fast because of dlp 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:45.680
 To reduce crosstalk 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:50.090
 Image other when because time without video output is watched by 3 d to take very short 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.470
 There is that feature that hole is overwhelmingly brighter than maker's projector later 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.590
 When I watched 3d because it is nice to see the picture 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:04.360
 Will be considered in the wind that better than those of other manufacturers Well this area is actually the over-the-counter 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.430
 I will exhibit it, so I hope you can check it on the actual machine. 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.770
 As I explained at the beginning, this projector is inferior to those of other manufacturers 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:18.129
 The zoom is 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:19.270
 I wonder if this is right or not it was assumed that 40 yen less than 400,000 yen was assumed 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:25.300
 Though 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:29.409
 Victor d and dna 's x3 are surprisingly similar, but just a nice Nico 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.760
 Well a number that glasses are lucky Toka emitter say is bought to have been built 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:36.129
 Shot 17,000 is that 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:42.099
 It belongs to the cheap class as a projector to which 3 d moves 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:46.300
 Ace thereof include Well um also had other effects the following effect for in the ward that dlp 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:50.440
 I think that I will never be inferior to people's 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:54.550
 It is zoom to manually take only a functionally good 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.210
 It is thing of other makers Victor doubles Zuney 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.610
 Sony's turn against 6 times 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.350
 Sharp is only one point 15 and a 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.630
 Almost can not move that 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.630
 Focus is teaching in Koizumi 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.230
 After all it is something like that 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.870
 I can not use lens shift at all 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:24.310
 Such a place is very important to say first to the installation environment I was a description of 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:27.520
 It does not be able to say eating Ano If you do not raise the projector to 2-1 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:34.540
 Well that's right, that's the weight after that 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:41.380
 This is compared to abl medicine think about 15 planes so Sony will go from 10 kilos in 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:44.850
 It is so light, 5.8 kg, that ceiling can be hung without special reinforcement . 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.850
 It seems as if there is no 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:54.990
 Well , that's a disco here, that's a disco 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.990
 I will try to replace it with Blu-ray
