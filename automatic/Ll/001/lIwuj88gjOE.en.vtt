quite quickly that tells me his
hip<00:02:11.580> flexors<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> week<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.600> we're<00:02:13.350> now<00:02:13.590> going

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
hip flexors a week and we're now going

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
hip flexors a week and we're now going
to<00:02:13.890> strengthen<00:02:14.400> them<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.270> check<00:02:15.450> his

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
to strengthen them up and then check his

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540 
to strengthen them up and then check his
hamstring<00:02:16.440> length<00:02:16.650> again<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.070> see<00:02:17.280> if<00:02:17.340> we've

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
hamstring length again to see if we've

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.090 
hamstring length again to see if we've
made<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.850> difference

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
made a difference

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.880 
made a difference
so<00:02:20.100> one<00:02:20.370> positive<00:02:20.940> assessment<00:02:21.720> done<00:02:21.990> one

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
so one positive assessment done one

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.930 
so one positive assessment done one
hopefully<00:02:23.880> positive<00:02:24.480> treatment<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
hopefully positive treatment to do the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.570 
hopefully positive treatment to do the

button<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.730> traditionally<00:02:35.730> what<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.570> I

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
button and traditionally what I do and I

button and traditionally what I do and I
find<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.000> works<00:02:39.180> quite<00:02:39.600> well<00:02:39.630> for<00:02:40.230> them

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
find that it works quite well for them

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.370 
find that it works quite well for them
is<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.680> use<00:02:40.920> two<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:41.490> three<00:02:41.700> fingers<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:43.080> rub

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
is I use two or three fingers and a rub

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.260 
is I use two or three fingers and a rub

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.170 

thirty<00:03:16.590> Seconds<00:03:17.160> how's<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.760> feel<00:03:18.000> then

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
thirty Seconds how's that feel then

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.420 
thirty Seconds how's that feel then
that's<00:03:18.570> good<00:03:18.840> sometimes<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:20.010> can<00:03:20.100> be<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.250> bit

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's good sometimes it can be a bit

right<00:03:26.670> that's<00:03:27.030> 30<00:03:27.360> seconds<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.050> we're<00:03:28.380> going

right that's 30 seconds and we're going

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.590 
right that's 30 seconds and we're going

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.250 
our hamstring length and L hip flexor
strength<00:03:34.850> we've<00:03:35.850> just<00:03:36.210> woken<00:03:36.750> up<00:03:37.050> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
strength we've just woken up and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.110 
strength we've just woken up and
facilitated<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.190> now<00:03:38.760> we're<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
facilitated and now we're going to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.000 
facilitated and now we're going to
retest<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.960> see<00:03:40.200> what's<00:03:40.470> happening<00:03:40.770> to<00:03:40.980> our

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
length but more importantly what's

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.080 
length but more importantly what's
happening<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> strength<00:03:43.920> ready<00:03:44.670> look

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
happening to the strength ready look

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.680 
happening to the strength ready look
great<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.620> leg<00:03:46.830> comes<00:03:47.180> just<00:03:48.180> tell<00:03:48.510> me

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
great up that leg comes just tell me

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.710 
great up that leg comes just tell me
when<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.230> start<00:03:49.530> feeling<00:03:49.800> tight<00:03:50.190> I'm<00:03:51.060> hoping

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
when you start feeling tight I'm hoping

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.790 
when you start feeling tight I'm hoping
that<00:03:51.870> we're<00:03:51.990> going<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.200> get<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.560> bit

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
that we're going to get a little bit

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.780 
that we're going to get a little bit
more<00:03:53.100> range<00:03:54.530> than<00:03:55.530> what<00:03:55.710> we<00:03:55.830> did<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.220> we've

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
more range than what we did and we've

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.030 
more range than what we did and we've
actually<00:03:56.940> already<00:03:57.240> passed<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.680> feels

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
actually already passed it it feels

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.530 
actually already passed it it feels
quite<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> bit<00:03:59.640> softer<00:04:00.470> where<00:04:01.470> are<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.680> feeling

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
quite a bit softer where are you feeling

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.030 
quite a bit softer where are you feeling
nothing<00:04:05.060> starting<00:04:06.060> about<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:06.510> all<00:04:06.750> right<00:04:06.990> so

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
nothing starting about that all right so

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
nothing starting about that all right so
that's<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.660> huge<00:04:09.710> huge<00:04:10.710> difference<00:04:10.980> let's<00:04:11.880> have

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
that's a huge huge difference let's have

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.520 
that's a huge huge difference let's have
a<00:04:12.090> look<00:04:12.270> at<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> strength<00:04:12.780> because<00:04:12.990> what<00:04:13.500> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
a look at the strength because what I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.430 
a look at the strength because what I
did<00:04:13.770> was<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.070> strength<00:04:14.430> component<00:04:15.109> hold<00:04:16.109> that

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
did was the strength component hold that

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.490 
did was the strength component hold that
leg<00:04:16.650> up<00:04:16.770> for<00:04:16.980> me<00:04:17.130> don't<00:04:17.940> let<00:04:18.120> me<00:04:18.180> push<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.540> down

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.590 

you<00:04:22.500> can<00:04:22.980> see<00:04:24.860> there<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.040> a<00:04:26.070> massive<00:04:26.910> massive

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
you can see there is a massive massive

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.170 
you can see there is a massive massive
change<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.620> we're<00:04:29.220> going<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.430> test<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.970> see

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
change and we're going to test and see

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.850 
change and we're going to test and see
how<00:04:30.210> he<00:04:30.450> goes<00:04:30.720> with<00:04:30.930> that<00:04:30.960> seated<00:04:31.560> hamstring

Ben has got an increase we had about

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.700 
Ben has got an increase we had about
this<00:04:41.729> much<00:04:42.090> difference<00:04:42.630> between<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:43.320> fingers

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
this much difference between the fingers

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.380 
this much difference between the fingers
and<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> toes

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390

shall<00:04:45.390> we<00:04:45.419> try<00:04:45.780> yep<00:04:46.140> okay<00:04:46.770> let's<00:04:47.190> go<00:04:50.030> there<00:04:51.030> we

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
shall we try yep okay let's go there we

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.260 
shall we try yep okay let's go there we
go<00:04:51.390> hey<00:04:51.900> feeling<00:04:52.380> stretching<00:04:53.220> he<00:04:53.880> could<00:04:54.060> stay

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
go hey feeling stretching he could stay

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.900 
go hey feeling stretching he could stay
here<00:04:54.479> all<00:04:54.540> day<00:04:54.690> though<00:04:55.280> not<00:04:56.280> really<00:04:56.460> but
