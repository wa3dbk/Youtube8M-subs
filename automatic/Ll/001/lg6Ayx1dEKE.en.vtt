with stretch fabrics one of the tricky
fabrics<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.370> week<00:00:08.610> we're<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.910> take<00:00:09.090> on

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
fabrics this week we're going to take on

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.540 
fabrics this week we're going to take on
another<00:00:09.510> tricky<00:00:09.960> fabric<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.500> napped<00:00:10.950> fabric

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
another tricky fabric a napped fabric

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.249 
another tricky fabric a napped fabric
I'm<00:00:11.790> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> show<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.450> some<00:00:12.809> tricks<00:00:13.049> on

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
I'm going to show you some tricks on

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.099 
I'm going to show you some tricks on
sewing<00:00:13.679> with<00:00:13.830> velvet<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:15.570> problem<00:00:15.990> with

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
sewing with velvet the problem with

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.349 
sewing with velvet the problem with
napped<00:00:16.410> fabrics<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.640> there<00:00:17.850> are<00:00:17.940> fibers

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
napped fabrics is that there are fibers

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.000 
napped fabrics is that there are fibers
that<00:00:18.600> are<00:00:18.660> sticking<00:00:19.109> straight<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
that are sticking straight up out of the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.460 
that are sticking straight up out of the
fabric<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.580> when<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.180> place<00:00:21.630> those<00:00:21.930> fibers

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
fabric and when you place those fibers

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.370 
fabric and when you place those fibers
face<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.189> face<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:23.730> nap<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.240> nap<00:00:24.449> they'll<00:00:25.140> tend

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
face to face or nap to nap they'll tend

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.370 
face to face or nap to nap they'll tend
to<00:00:25.529> walk<00:00:26.119> against<00:00:27.119> each<00:00:27.269> other<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.230> will

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to walk against each other and that will

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.960 
to walk against each other and that will
make<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> fabric<00:00:28.920> shift<00:00:29.400> around<00:00:29.670> while

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
make the fabric shift around while

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.889 
make the fabric shift around while
you're<00:00:30.150> trying<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.599> sew<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.710> happens<00:00:32.399> with

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
as bad with corduroy but especially bad

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
going to show you what happens if you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
going to show you what happens if you
sew<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.379> without<00:00:43.590> any<00:00:43.860> pins<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.610> what

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
sew this without any pins which is what

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.799 
sew this without any pins which is what
I<00:00:44.789> would<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.390> were<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> regular

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I would do if this were a regular

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.220 
I would do if this were a regular
quilting<00:00:46.440> cotton<00:00:53.480> it's<00:00:54.480> already<00:00:54.780> starting<00:00:55.170> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
quilting cotton it's already starting to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
quilting cotton it's already starting to
shift<00:00:55.469> overall<00:00:55.980> nice<00:00:56.190> I'm<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> try

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
shift overall nice I'm going to try

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:15.830 
shift overall nice I'm going to try
resetting<00:00:57.329> it<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:13.590> happened<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.840> that

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
resetting it so what happened is that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
resetting it so what happened is that
you<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.189> didn't<00:01:17.490> stay<00:01:17.790> lined

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you can see that they didn't stay lined

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.469 
you can see that they didn't stay lined
up<00:01:18.470> my<00:01:19.470> edges<00:01:20.159> started<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.700> lined<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
up my edges started out lined up but it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.690 
up my edges started out lined up but it
tended<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> walk<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.409> along<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> sides<00:01:23.280> there

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
tended to walk out along the sides there

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.690 
tended to walk out along the sides there
and<00:01:24.290> I<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.409> able<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> correct<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.430> but

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and I was able to correct it back but

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.950 
and I was able to correct it back but
you<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> keep<00:01:27.240> stopping<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you have to keep stopping and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.350 
you have to keep stopping and
readjusting<00:01:28.530> everything<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.640> other<00:01:29.790> problem

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
readjusting everything the other problem

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.630 
readjusting everything the other problem
is<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:31.049> these<00:01:31.770> started<00:01:32.189> out<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> same

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
is that these started out the same

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.060 
is that these started out the same
length<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> bottom<00:01:33.630> strip<00:01:34.560> ended<00:01:34.950> up

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
length and the bottom strip ended up

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.940 
length and the bottom strip ended up
being<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.240> bit<00:01:36.689> longer<00:01:37.350> than<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
being just a little bit longer than the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
being just a little bit longer than the
top<00:01:38.250> strip<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.329> were<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.780> example<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
top strip if this were for example the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
top strip if this were for example the
length<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> pair<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> pants<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:42.150> bottom

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
length of a pair of pants that bottom

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
length of a pair of pants that bottom
strip<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.049> off<00:01:43.200> by<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> full<00:01:43.860> inch<00:01:44.130> by<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
strip would be off by a full inch by the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.889 
strip would be off by a full inch by the
time<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> bottom<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.630> maybe<00:01:45.750> even

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
time you got to the bottom or maybe even

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.230 
time you got to the bottom or maybe even
more<00:01:46.439> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.790> thing<00:01:48.000> when

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
more which is not a good thing when

extra<00:02:05.969> pin<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.450> between<00:02:06.719> all<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.049> pins<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
extra pin in between all your pins you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
extra pin in between all your pins you
cannot<00:02:07.950> pin<00:02:08.220> too<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.640> when<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.090> working

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
cannot pin too much when you're working

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.750 
cannot pin too much when you're working
with<00:02:09.450> Velvets<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.459> I'm<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> sew<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.550 

and<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.900> stopped<00:02:17.290> at<00:02:17.530> every<00:02:17.980> pan<00:02:19.050> because<00:02:20.050> when

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
and I stopped at every pan because when

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770 
and I stopped at every pan because when
I<00:02:20.590> run<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.190> over<00:02:21.460> pins<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.970> break<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.390> needle<00:02:22.540> on

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
I run so over pins I break the needle on

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.100 
I run so over pins I break the needle on
my<00:02:22.900> machine<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.560> that's<00:02:24.220> irritating<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.960> it's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
my machine and that's irritating so it's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.010 
my machine and that's irritating so it's
kind<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.380> slow<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.240> pin<00:02:28.600> all

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
kind of slow going but if you pin all

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.850 
kind of slow going but if you pin all
along<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.430> seam<00:02:31.560> everything<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.680> going<00:02:32.830> to

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
along the seam everything is going to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.940 
along the seam everything is going to
stay<00:02:33.130> lined<00:02:33.370> up<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.110> your<00:02:35.110> fabric<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.710> not

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
stay lined up and your fabric is not

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.730 
stay lined up and your fabric is not
going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.340> grow<00:02:37.090> more<00:02:37.630> on<00:02:37.900> one<00:02:38.170> side<00:02:38.440> than<00:02:38.710> on

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
going to grow more on one side than on

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.850 
going to grow more on one side than on
the<00:02:38.860> other<00:02:39.960> everything<00:02:40.960> just<00:02:41.140> works<00:02:41.440> much

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
the other everything just works much

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.030 
the other everything just works much
much<00:02:42.400> better<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.810> can<00:02:43.990> sew<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.500> really

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
much better and you can sew a really

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.260 
much better and you can sew a really
precise<00:02:45.790> seam<00:02:47.040> even<00:02:48.040> though<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.610> fabric<00:02:49.060> is

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
precise seam even though the fabric is

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.600 
precise seam even though the fabric is
napped<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:50.710> I'm<00:02:50.770> going<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.980> flip<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.340> over

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
napped so I'm going to flip this over

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.920 
napped so I'm going to flip this over
because<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:52.000> always<00:02:52.120> looks<00:02:52.360> great<00:02:52.600> from<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
because it always looks great from the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.540 
because it always looks great from the
top<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.320> here's<00:02:53.830> how<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.070> looks<00:02:54.220> from<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
top and here's how it looks from the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.530 
top and here's how it looks from the
back<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.590> much<00:02:56.770> better<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:58.480> could

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
back which is much better and I could

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.210 
back which is much better and I could
tell<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.260> was<00:02:59.410> selling<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.830> too<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.130> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
tell as I was selling it too that it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.920 
tell as I was selling it too that it
wasn't<00:03:00.400> shifting<00:03:00.700> or<00:03:01.030> pulling<00:03:01.240> around<00:03:01.600> at<00:03:01.780> me

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
wasn't shifting or pulling around at me

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.980 
wasn't shifting or pulling around at me
at<00:03:02.020> all<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.170> had<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.560> babysit<00:03:02.950> it<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.160> lot<00:03:03.430> less<00:03:03.990> so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
at all I had to babysit it a lot less so

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.080 
at all I had to babysit it a lot less so
that's<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.410> there<00:03:05.740> is<00:03:05.890> one<00:03:06.190> secret<00:03:06.550> to<00:03:06.910> working

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
that's it there is one secret to working

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.300 
that's it there is one secret to working
with<00:03:07.420> napped<00:03:07.720> fabrics<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.590> is<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.920> pin

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
with napped fabrics and that is to pin

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.690 
with napped fabrics and that is to pin
pin<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.390> pin<00:03:10.720> some<00:03:11.020> more<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.100> true<00:03:12.460> for
