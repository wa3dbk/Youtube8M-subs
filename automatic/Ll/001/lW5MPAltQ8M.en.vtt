here<00:01:29.110> which<00:01:30.110> is<00:01:30.229> about<00:01:30.440> three<00:01:31.960> let's<00:01:32.960> figure

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
here which is about three let's figure

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.320 
here which is about three let's figure
out<00:01:33.470> how<00:01:33.619> far<00:01:34.190> we<00:01:34.369> need<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.820> move<00:01:35.000> away<00:01:35.060> from

drops under three an inch to two inches
away<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:45.790> curious<00:02:50.910> e<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.060> varies<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:52.720> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
away just curious e it varies but it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.260 
away just curious e it varies but it
rests<00:02:53.230> at<00:02:53.350> around<00:02:53.620> 100<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.700> sometimes<00:02:57.850> goes

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
rests at around 100 but sometimes goes

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.680 
rests at around 100 but sometimes goes
all<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.510> way<00:02:58.660> down<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.900> 15<00:02:59.500> a<00:03:00.450> safe<00:03:01.450> distance

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
all the way down to 15 a safe distance

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:11.370 
all the way down to 15 a safe distance
away<00:03:02.080> would<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.830> around<00:03:09.690> five<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.959> six<00:03:11.170> inches

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.800 

right<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.610> one<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:44.120> think<00:04:45.120> I'm<00:04:45.420> measuring<00:04:45.570> up

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
right this one I think I'm measuring up

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.120 
right this one I think I'm measuring up
to<00:04:45.840> 12<00:04:46.910> well<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.180> wind<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.480> very<00:04:48.780> safe<00:04:49.140> it's

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
to 12 well the wind is very safe it's

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.470 
to 12 well the wind is very safe it's
not<00:04:50.280> even<00:04:50.430> one<00:04:50.760> now<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.840> is

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:04.370 

by<00:04:56.020> very<00:04:56.320> little<00:04:56.680> it's<00:04:57.400> still<00:04:57.700> about<00:04:58.210> one

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:40.840 

still<00:05:05.380> one

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.670 

the<00:05:41.850> measurement<00:05:42.330> here<00:05:42.570> is<00:05:42.720> only<00:05:42.900> seven<00:05:45.680> the

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
the measurement here is only seven the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.410 
the measurement here is only seven the
measurement<00:05:47.160> here<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.550> solid<00:05:48.060> one<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.390> a

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
measurement here is a solid one and a

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.060 
measurement here is a solid one and a
half<00:05:48.800> wow<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.160> measurement<00:05:50.580> here<00:05:50.790> is<00:05:51.030> 35

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
half wow the measurement here is 35

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.820 
half wow the measurement here is 35
maybe<00:05:53.070> it's<00:05:53.310> bad<00:05:53.490> wiring<00:05:54.230> what's<00:05:55.230> fun<00:05:55.440> ah

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
maybe it's bad wiring what's fun ah

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.720 
maybe it's bad wiring what's fun ah
right<00:05:56.400> there<00:05:59.600> it's<00:06:00.600> over<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:00.960> hundred<00:06:01.280> way<00:06:02.280> over

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
right there it's over a hundred way over

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.090 
right there it's over a hundred way over
100<00:06:02.910> maybe<00:06:03.900> it's<00:06:04.140> probably<00:06:04.650> due<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:04.890> those

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
100 maybe it's probably due to those

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.910 
100 maybe it's probably due to those
wires<00:06:05.430> up<00:06:05.700> there<00:06:05.990> they<00:06:06.990> are<00:06:07.020> poorly<00:06:07.380> concealed

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
wires up there they are poorly concealed

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.450 
wires up there they are poorly concealed
as<00:06:08.190> you<00:06:08.280> can<00:06:08.430> see<00:06:08.640> them<00:06:08.850> physically<00:06:10.100> we<00:06:11.100> go<00:06:11.280> on

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
as you can see them physically we go on

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.160 
as you can see them physically we go on
down<00:06:11.790> there<00:06:12.090> where<00:06:12.510> there's<00:06:12.630> overhead<00:06:13.140> wiring

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
down there where there's overhead wiring

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.280 
down there where there's overhead wiring
therefore<00:06:16.170> we<00:06:16.380> could<00:06:16.500> take<00:06:16.650> a<00:06:16.860> seat<00:06:17.990> this<00:06:18.990> call

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
therefore we could take a seat this call

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:32.280 
therefore we could take a seat this call
is<00:06:19.320> almost<00:06:19.770> a<00:06:19.920> hundred<00:06:20.070> say<00:06:20.580> it's<00:06:20.760> about<00:06:20.880> nine

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.570 

this<00:06:33.290> we're<00:06:33.440> gonna<00:06:33.500> walk<00:06:33.770> back<00:06:34.100> we<00:06:34.550> won<00:06:36.580> Wow

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
this we're gonna walk back we won Wow

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.910 
this we're gonna walk back we won Wow
energy<00:06:38.270> saving<00:06:38.660> both<00:06:38.870> still<00:06:39.200> have<00:06:39.380> a<00:06:39.410> move<00:06:39.710> on

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
energy saving both still have a move on

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.320 
energy saving both still have a move on
speaking<00:06:40.280> of<00:06:40.460> one<00:06:40.790> I<00:06:41.090> guess<00:06:41.510> the<00:06:41.780> power<00:06:42.170> saving

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
speaking of one I guess the power saving

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.560 
speaking of one I guess the power saving
these<00:06:44.330> very<00:06:44.810> little<00:06:45.110> what<00:06:45.200> tricity
