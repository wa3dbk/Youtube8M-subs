hi guys were back with sessions 33 now I
know<00:00:05.130> in<00:00:05.400> sessions<00:00:05.850> 32<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.420> mentioned<00:00:07.049> ICU<00:00:07.649> care

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
know in sessions 32 I mentioned ICU care

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.230 
know in sessions 32 I mentioned ICU care
and<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:09.090> some<00:00:09.330> degree<00:00:10.040> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.099> ICU<00:00:11.730> care<00:00:12.030> also

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
and to some degree this is ICU care also

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.829

but<00:00:12.719> bear<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.500> mind<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.130> there<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.580> ICU<00:00:15.570> care

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
but bear in mind that there is ICU care

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.890 
but bear in mind that there is ICU care
and<00:00:16.080> CCU<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:17.460> extensive<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.420> even<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.779> all

and CCU is extensive and even with all
that<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.230> mentioned<00:00:19.740> there's<00:00:20.340> still<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> lot<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that we mentioned there's still a lot to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.470 
that we mentioned there's still a lot to
learn

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480

because<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.660> see<00:00:39.660> use<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> CeCe<00:00:40.980> use<00:00:41.100> will

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
because I see use very and CeCe use will

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
because I see use very and CeCe use will
vary<00:00:41.550> from<00:00:41.760> one<00:00:42.000> place<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> next<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:43.590> are

site<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> catheter<00:03:41.250> take<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> look<00:03:42.329> at<00:03:42.449> this

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
site of the catheter take a look at this

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.059 
site of the catheter take a look at this
tracing<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.229> means<00:03:43.439> something<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:43.919> obviously

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
tracing it means something is obviously

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.640 
tracing it means something is obviously
wrong<00:03:44.609> if<00:03:44.939> you're<00:03:45.389> tracing<00:03:45.750> was<00:03:46.109> correct<00:03:46.530> this

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
wrong if you're tracing was correct this

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.349 
wrong if you're tracing was correct this
is<00:03:46.859> what<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.189> would<00:03:47.310> expect<00:03:47.370> something

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
is what you would expect something

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.360 
is what you would expect something
similar<00:03:48.959> you'd<00:03:49.109> see<00:03:49.349> a<00:03:49.379> wave<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.919> monitor

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
similar you'd see a wave on the monitor

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.550

complaining<00:04:38.139> of<00:04:38.349> indigestion<00:04:39.219> and<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.729> nurse

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
complaining of indigestion and the nurse

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.240 
complaining of indigestion and the nurse
medicates<00:04:40.509> him<00:04:40.750> but<00:04:41.349> she's<00:04:41.560> not<00:04:41.770> he's<00:04:42.069> not

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
myocardial infarction because it lies

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.670 
myocardial infarction because it lies
the<00:04:48.789> inferior<00:04:49.389> wall<00:04:49.599> of<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.900> heart<00:04:50.110> lies<00:04:50.409> on

the inferior wall of the heart lies on
the<00:04:50.770> diaphragm<00:04:51.099> so<00:04:51.939> what<00:04:52.150> do<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.389> get<00:04:52.599> a<00:04:52.629> lot

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
the diaphragm so what do you get a lot

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.320 
the diaphragm so what do you get a lot
of<00:04:52.990> complaining<00:04:53.469> of<00:04:53.650> indigestion<00:04:54.189> be<00:04:55.030> aware

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
of complaining of indigestion be aware

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.939 
of complaining of indigestion be aware
if<00:04:55.509> you<00:04:55.539> have<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.870> patient<00:04:56.139> who's<00:04:56.919> been

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
if you have a patient who's been

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.249 
if you have a patient who's been
complaining<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.729> indigestion<00:04:58.569> that's<00:04:58.990> not

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
complaining of indigestion that's not

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.600 
complaining of indigestion that's not
going<00:04:59.530> away<00:04:59.770> you've<00:05:00.069> treated<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.639> with<00:05:01.139> anti

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
going away you've treated it with anti

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.850 
going away you've treated it with anti
antacids<00:05:03.610> it's<00:05:03.759> just<00:05:03.940> not<00:05:04.180> going<00:05:04.449> away

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
antacids it's just not going away

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.439 
antacids it's just not going away
suspect<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.009> might<00:05:06.219> be<00:05:06.400> something<00:05:06.669> more

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
suspect it might be something more

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.839 
suspect it might be something more
involving<00:05:08.020> than<00:05:08.229> just<00:05:08.469> our<00:05:08.680> heartland<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:09.789> you

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
involving than just our heartland so you

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.420 
involving than just our heartland so you
need<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.300> check<00:05:10.599> the<00:05:10.780> vital<00:05:11.110> signs<00:05:11.430> administer

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
need to check the vital signs administer

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.089 
need to check the vital signs administer
or<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.819> notify<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.330> doctor<00:05:13.659> don't<00:05:14.530> forget<00:05:14.919> to

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
or to notify the doctor don't forget to

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.969 
or to notify the doctor don't forget to
ask<00:05:15.190> document<00:05:15.909> your<00:05:16.030> findings<00:05:16.569> now<00:05:17.469> we<00:05:17.530> talked

look at ventricular tachycardia you can

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.290 
look at ventricular tachycardia you can
see<00:05:35.469> that<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:35.830> have<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.190> distinct<00:05:36.759> wave<00:05:36.940> but

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
see that you have that distinct wave but

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.999 
see that you have that distinct wave but
indeed<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.139> don't<00:05:38.440> even<00:05:38.620> though<00:05:38.860> it's
