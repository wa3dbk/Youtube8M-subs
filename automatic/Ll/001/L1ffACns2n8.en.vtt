build<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.140> works<00:00:07.350> in<00:00:07.529> correlation<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
build that works in correlation with the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.310 
build that works in correlation with the
change<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.059> weapon<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:09.750> first<00:00:09.990> off<00:00:10.139> let's

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
change to the weapon but first off let's

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.720 
change to the weapon but first off let's
take<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> look<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:10.800> what<00:00:10.980> actually<00:00:11.130> got<00:00:11.400> buffed

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
take a look at what actually got buffed

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.459 
take a look at what actually got buffed
in<00:00:11.910> terms<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.300> stats<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> weapon<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
in terms of stats on the weapon so the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.570 
in terms of stats on the weapon so the
first<00:00:13.679> thing<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> notice<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
first thing to notice is that the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.099 
first thing to notice is that the
overall<00:00:15.000> base<00:00:15.269> damage<00:00:15.660> actually<00:00:15.839> got

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
overall base damage actually got

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.870 
overall base damage actually got
increased<00:00:16.470> by<00:00:16.590> 25<00:00:17.070> points<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.609> went<00:00:17.699> from

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
increased by 25 points so it went from

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.929 
increased by 25 points so it went from
100<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> 125<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.710> still<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> mostly<00:00:20.460> puncture

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
100 to 125 it's still a mostly puncture

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.470 
100 to 125 it's still a mostly puncture
weapon<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.539> 93.8<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.619> 25<00:00:23.039> slash<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> 6.3

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
impact they didn't touch anything with

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.370 
impact they didn't touch anything with
the<00:00:26.519> status<00:00:26.849> chance<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.210> still<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.390> low<00:00:27.570> 10%<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the status chance is still a low 10% and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.349 
the status chance is still a low 10% and
the<00:00:28.439> crit<00:00:28.650> chance<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.039> still<00:00:29.130> only<00:00:29.460> 20%<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the crit chance is still only 20% with a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.870 
the crit chance is still only 20% with a
1.5<00:00:30.900> multiplier<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.890> full-on<00:00:32.189> status<00:00:32.550> fields

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
1.5 multiplier so full-on status fields

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
1.5 multiplier so full-on status fields
and<00:00:33.059> crit<00:00:33.690> builds<00:00:33.989> aren't<00:00:34.260> viable<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
and crit builds aren't viable on the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.170 
and crit builds aren't viable on the
weapon<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> next<00:00:35.489> change<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.820> happen<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
weapon the next change that happen is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
weapon the next change that happen is
that<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> clip<00:00:36.660> size<00:00:36.840> actually<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.410> doubles

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that the clip size actually got doubles

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.860 
that the clip size actually got doubles
so<00:00:38.040> went<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.309> 8<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.700> 16<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> pretty

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so went from 8 to 16 and this is pretty

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
so went from 8 to 16 and this is pretty
awesome<00:00:40.079> because<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> reload<00:00:41.010> time<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.309> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
awesome because the reload time on this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.310 
awesome because the reload time on this
weapon<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.969> pretty<00:00:42.239> ridiculous<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.050> just

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
weapon is pretty ridiculous it's just

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
weapon is pretty ridiculous it's just
shy<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> 3<00:00:44.010> seconds<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> pretty<00:00:45.239> big

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
shy of 3 seconds this is a pretty big

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
shy of 3 seconds this is a pretty big
boost<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> terms<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> utility<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> final

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
boost in terms of utility but the final

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.130 
boost in terms of utility but the final
buff<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> most<00:00:48.120> exciting<00:00:48.690> basically<00:00:49.050> what

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
buff is the most exciting basically what

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.720 
buff is the most exciting basically what
happened<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.530> fire<00:00:50.010> rate<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.219> almost

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
happened is that fire rate is almost

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.479 
happened is that fire rate is almost
double<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.629> sits<00:00:51.930> at<00:00:52.110> 3<00:00:52.410> point<00:00:52.739> 3<00:00:52.949> rounds

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
double that now sits at 3 point 3 rounds

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
double that now sits at 3 point 3 rounds
per<00:00:53.670> second<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> huge<00:00:54.930> increase<00:00:55.410> in

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
per second this is a huge increase in

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.010 
per second this is a huge increase in
terms<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> DPS<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.210> also<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:57.780> really

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
terms of DPS and is also what really

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
terms of DPS and is also what really
makes<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> Thunderbolt<00:00:58.980> build<00:00:59.250> work<00:00:59.579> now

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
makes the Thunderbolt build work now

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.340 
makes the Thunderbolt build work now
just<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> clarify<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.690> those<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
just to clarify for those of you that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.479 
just to clarify for those of you that
don't<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.620> what<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.859> talking<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.250> when

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
don't know what I'm talking about when

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.770 
don't know what I'm talking about when
I'm<00:01:02.579> saying<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.120> Thunderbolt<00:01:03.570> build

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I'm saying the Thunderbolt build

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
I'm saying the Thunderbolt build
basically<00:01:04.170> Thunderbolt<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> mod<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.339> used

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
basically Thunderbolt is a mod that used

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
basically Thunderbolt is a mod that used
to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> exclusive<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> Paras<00:01:07.260> prime<00:01:07.530> that

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to be exclusive to the Paras prime that

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.609 
to be exclusive to the Paras prime that
gave<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> 30%<00:01:08.850> chance<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.570> AoE<00:01:09.900> explosion

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
gave a 30% chance to do an AoE explosion

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.850 
gave a 30% chance to do an AoE explosion
that<00:01:10.799> did<00:01:11.180> 250<00:01:12.180> blast<00:01:12.510> damage<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> target

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that did 250 blast damage on the target

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.679 
that did 250 blast damage on the target
but<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> recent<00:01:14.640> patch<00:01:14.820> update<00:01:15.299> 14

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
but from the recent patch update 14

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.990 
but from the recent patch update 14
point<00:01:15.990> 2.0<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.009> been<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.580> only<00:01:17.610> made

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
point 2.0 it's been not only made

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.310 
point 2.0 it's been not only made
available<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> other<00:01:18.780> bows<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
available to the other bows like a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.020 
available to the other bows like a
cirno's<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.890> dread<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.340> most<00:01:20.490> importantly

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
cirno's the dread but most importantly

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.240 
cirno's the dread but most importantly
to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> Attica<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.650> why<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.860> works

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to the Attica now as to why this works

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.679 
to the Attica now as to why this works
so<00:01:23.340> good<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> Attica<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> other

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so good on the Attica and not the other

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.270 
so good on the Attica and not the other
bows<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.200> comes<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> fire<00:01:26.130> right

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
bows just comes down to the fire right

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
bows just comes down to the fire right
because<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> single<00:01:27.360> shot<00:01:27.540> bows<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
because on the single shot bows like the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
because on the single shot bows like the
Paris<00:01:28.470> primer<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> dread<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.729> example

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
Paris primer the dread for example

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
Paris primer the dread for example
you're<00:01:30.420> only<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.930> shooting<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.409> shot<00:01:31.619> at

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you're only really shooting one shot at

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.350 
you're only really shooting one shot at
a<00:01:31.740> time<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.220> charge<00:01:32.640> up<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.180> because

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
a time with the charge up and because

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.940 
a time with the charge up and because
there's<00:01:33.570> only<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.750> 30%<00:01:34.259> chance<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.680> proc<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there's only a 30% chance to proc the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
there's only a 30% chance to proc the
explosion<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.900> basically<00:01:36.900> wasn't<00:01:37.110> worth

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
explosion it basically wasn't worth

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.319 
explosion it basically wasn't worth
removing<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.920> damage<00:01:38.280> monitoring<00:01:38.670> element<00:01:39.119> for

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
removing a damage monitoring element for

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
removing a damage monitoring element for
it<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.049> Attica<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.680> fully

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it but because as Attica is fully

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
it but because as Attica is fully
automatic<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:42.180> much<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.600> your

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
automatic you can pretty much up your

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.780 
automatic you can pretty much up your
probability<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.220> based<00:01:44.520> off<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
probability a lot just based off the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.520 
probability a lot just based off the
fire<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.689> another<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.320> key

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
fire if you know another really key

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
fire if you know another really key
point<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.729> Thunderbolt<00:01:48.299> mod

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
point to know about the Thunderbolt mod

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
point to know about the Thunderbolt mod
is<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> actual<00:01:49.380> explosion<00:01:50.130> damage

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is that the actual explosion damage

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.219 
is that the actual explosion damage
itself<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.030> separate<00:01:51.509> from<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> regular<00:01:51.899> base

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
itself is separate from the regular base

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
itself is separate from the regular base
damage<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> weapon<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.640> mean<00:01:53.880> is

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
damage of the weapon so what I mean is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
damage of the weapon so what I mean is
you'll<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> initial<00:01:55.170> impact<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you'll get the initial impact of the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.410 
you'll get the initial impact of the
arrow<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.610> you'll<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> damage

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
arrow and then you'll get the damage

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.630 
arrow and then you'll get the damage
from<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> explosion<00:01:57.719> after<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> cool<00:01:59.280> trick

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
from the explosion after so a cool trick

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.219 
from the explosion after so a cool trick
is<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.909> you<00:01:59.939> use<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> shred<00:02:00.479> mod<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.869> example

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
is if you use a shred mod for example

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
is if you use a shred mod for example
which<00:02:01.380> buffs<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.369> fire<00:02:02.610> rate<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.939> also

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
which buffs your fire rate and also

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
which buffs your fire rate and also
gives<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> punch<00:02:04.020> through<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.530> possible<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
gives you punch through it's possible to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
gives you punch through it's possible to
actually<00:02:05.159> shoot<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:05.640> arrow<00:02:05.790> through<00:02:06.119> an<00:02:06.329> enemy

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
actually shoot an arrow through an enemy

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.119 
actually shoot an arrow through an enemy
and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.140> explode<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> other

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and then have it explode out the other

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.710 
and then have it explode out the other
side<00:02:08.459> another<00:02:08.879> thing<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> consider<00:02:09.270> too<00:02:09.690> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
side another thing to consider too is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240 
side another thing to consider too is
when<00:02:09.959> using<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.289> split<00:02:10.470> chamber<00:02:10.679> mod<00:02:10.979> which<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
when using the split chamber mod which I

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
when using the split chamber mod which I
recommend<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:12.060> primaries<00:02:12.660> by<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> way<00:02:13.080> is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
recommend on all primaries by the way is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.970 
recommend on all primaries by the way is
you<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.470> actually

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
you can actually

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.670 
you can actually
your<00:02:14.159> chance<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> explosion<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.680> 58.5

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
your chance of the explosion to a 58.5

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.619 
your chance of the explosion to a 58.5
chance<00:02:17.129> based<00:02:17.430> off<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> probability<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
chance based off the probability of the

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.080 
chance based off the probability of the
90%<00:02:18.930> chance<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.650> proc<00:02:19.890> two<00:02:20.129> arrows<00:02:20.519> per<00:02:20.790> shot

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
90% chance to proc two arrows per shot

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.119 
90% chance to proc two arrows per shot
and<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.480> final<00:02:21.720> thing<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.500> explosion

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
and a final thing is that the explosion

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.740 
and a final thing is that the explosion
from<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.280> Thunderbolt<00:02:23.730> actually<00:02:24.060> does<00:02:24.180> blast

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
from the Thunderbolt actually does blast

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.720 
from the Thunderbolt actually does blast
damage<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.349> has<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> chance<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.099> knock<00:02:26.519> down

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
damage so it has a chance to knock down

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.210 
damage so it has a chance to knock down
enemies<00:02:27.209> off<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.690> proc<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.560> also<00:02:28.739> can

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
enemies off the proc and it also can

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.070 
enemies off the proc and it also can
damage<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.269> mean<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.540> says<00:02:30.690> right<00:02:30.959> on

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
damage you so I mean it says right on

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080 
damage you so I mean it says right on
the<00:02:31.200> mod<00:02:31.379> used<00:02:31.739> with<00:02:32.010> caution<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.670> mean<00:02:32.940> it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the mod used with caution I mean it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
the mod used with caution I mean it
won't<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.450> much<00:02:33.629> damage<00:02:33.660> though<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.349> using

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
won't do as much damage though as using

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.470 
won't do as much damage though as using
the<00:02:34.739> Penta<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.250> example<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.120> won't<00:02:36.390> have

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the Penta for example so you won't have

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.789 
the Penta for example so you won't have
to<00:02:36.569> worry<00:02:36.780> about<00:02:36.840> one<00:02:37.200> shotting<00:02:37.500> yourself

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
to worry about one shotting yourself

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:38.869 
to worry about one shotting yourself
especially<00:02:37.920> if<00:02:38.129> you're<00:02:38.250> using<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.549> car<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.849> know

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
especially if you're using a car I know

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.670 
especially if you're using a car I know
but<00:02:39.209> still<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.660> should<00:02:39.840> be<00:02:40.049> careful<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
but still you should be careful with it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.259 
but still you should be careful with it
a<00:02:40.799> conclusion<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.549> weapon<00:02:41.730> definitely

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
a conclusion of this weapon definitely

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.819 
a conclusion of this weapon definitely
benefited<00:02:42.810> from<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.019> latest<00:02:43.290> buffs<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
benefited from the latest buffs from the

benefited from the latest buffs from the
recent<00:02:44.190> patch<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.640> I'm<00:02:44.730> glad<00:02:45.000> because<00:02:45.030> who

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.130 
of course is thunderbolt this will give
you<00:04:19.829> your<00:04:19.979> 30%<00:04:20.549> chance<00:04:20.729> for<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.510> explosion

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
you your 30% chance for the explosion

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.469 
you your 30% chance for the explosion
and<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.860> is<00:04:23.070> pretty<00:04:23.370> much<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.940> entire<00:04:24.210> build

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
and this is pretty much the entire build

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.510 
and this is pretty much the entire build
is<00:04:24.690> basically<00:04:25.650> sitting<00:04:25.919> around<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.340> and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
is basically sitting around this and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.860 
is basically sitting around this and
trying<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.760> complement<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.330> as<00:04:27.510> best

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
trying to complement this as best

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.469 
trying to complement this as best
can<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:29.010> config<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.669> though<00:04:29.880> is<00:04:30.090> for<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
can this config a though is for the

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.120 
can this config a though is for the
Grenier<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:30.870> your<00:04:30.990> best<00:04:31.169> elemental<00:04:31.680> combos<00:04:32.010> is

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
Grenier so your best elemental combos is

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.040 
Grenier so your best elemental combos is
going<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.430> radiation<00:04:32.820> first<00:04:33.180> as<00:04:33.510> electric

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
going to be radiation first as electric

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.960 
going to be radiation first as electric
and<00:04:34.260> fire<00:04:34.530> we'll<00:04:34.710> give<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:34.979> that<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.790> that's

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
and fire we'll give you that so that's

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.670 
and fire we'll give you that so that's
good<00:04:36.180> against<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.510> alloy<00:04:36.690> target<00:04:37.199> units<00:04:37.500> and

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
good against the alloy target units and

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.100 
good against the alloy target units and
then<00:04:37.979> toxic<00:04:38.880> on<00:04:39.030> its<00:04:39.240> own<00:04:39.419> is<00:04:39.690> good<00:04:39.900> against

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
then toxic on its own is good against

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.750 
then toxic on its own is good against
ferrite<00:04:40.530> Armour<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.340> way<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.550> get<00:04:41.699> a

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
ferrite Armour so this way you get a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.640 
ferrite Armour so this way you get a
really<00:04:42.120> good<00:04:42.270> coverage<00:04:42.750> against<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.380> entire

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
really good coverage against the entire

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.670 
really good coverage against the entire
faction<00:04:44.010> let's<00:04:44.820> move<00:04:45.000> on<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.330> corpus<00:04:46.290> now<00:04:46.440> so

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
faction let's move on to corpus now so

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.020 
faction let's move on to corpus now so
the<00:04:46.770> corpus<00:04:47.220> first<00:04:47.520> thing<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.669> want<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.850> build

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
the corpus first thing I want to build

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.060 
the corpus first thing I want to build
is<00:04:48.180> magnetic<00:04:48.720> that's<00:04:48.930> electric<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.590> ice<00:04:49.800> is

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
is magnetic that's electric and ice is

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.280 
is magnetic that's electric and ice is
damaging<00:04:50.490> shields<00:04:51.000> toxic<00:04:51.750> on<00:04:51.870> ozone<00:04:52.080> goes

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
damaging shields toxic on ozone goes

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.659 
damaging shields toxic on ozone goes
through<00:04:52.620> shields<00:04:52.949> gives<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.190> multipliers

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
through shields gives you multipliers

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.250 
through shields gives you multipliers
against<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.000> fleshy<00:04:54.270> units<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.840> then

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
against the fleshy units and then

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.159 
against the fleshy units and then
actually<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.699> crown's<00:04:57.180> is<00:04:57.419> nine

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
actually because the crown's is nine

00:04:58.169 --> 00:04:59.960 
actually because the crown's is nine
seven<00:04:58.530> eleven<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:58.949> was<00:04:59.160> able<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.460> max<00:04:59.760> out<00:04:59.940> my

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
seven eleven I was able to max out my

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.840 
seven eleven I was able to max out my
shred<00:05:00.479> for<00:05:00.750> this<00:05:00.930> particular<00:05:01.470> config<00:05:01.949> now<00:05:02.760> I'm

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
shred for this particular config now I'm

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.370 
shred for this particular config now I'm
moving<00:05:03.090> on<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.539> last<00:05:03.720> one<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.229> for

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
moving on to the last one this is for

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.070 
moving on to the last one this is for
your<00:05:04.590> infested<00:05:05.100> slash<00:05:05.479> void<00:05:06.479> build<00:05:06.840> and

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
your infested slash void build and

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.500 
your infested slash void build and
basically<00:05:07.680> first<00:05:07.949> is<00:05:08.220> corrosive<00:05:08.610> for<00:05:09.419> the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
basically first is corrosive for the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.300 
basically first is corrosive for the
infested<00:05:09.960> corrosive<00:05:10.410> does<00:05:10.620> extra<00:05:11.280> damage

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
infested corrosive does extra damage

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.840 
infested corrosive does extra damage
against<00:05:11.699> the<00:05:11.880> ancients<00:05:12.449> and<00:05:12.570> then<00:05:12.960> fire<00:05:13.850> will

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
against the ancients and then fire will

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.400 
against the ancients and then fire will
basically<00:05:15.000> do<00:05:15.270> good<00:05:15.600> damage<00:05:15.750> against<00:05:16.080> all<00:05:16.260> the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
basically do good damage against all the

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.510 
basically do good damage against all the
other<00:05:16.440> units<00:05:16.800> in<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:16.949> faction<00:05:17.280> like<00:05:17.370> the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
other units in the faction like the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.159 
other units in the faction like the
lighted<00:05:17.820> units<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.150> all<00:05:18.300> around<00:05:18.419> coverage<00:05:18.960> and

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
lighted units so all around coverage and

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.050 
lighted units so all around coverage and
then<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.680> voids<00:05:19.949> corrosive<00:05:20.789> is<00:05:20.880> great

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
then the voids corrosive is great

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.120 
then the voids corrosive is great
against<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.449> heavy<00:05:21.630> gunners<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.350> then<00:05:22.800> fire

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
against the heavy gunners and then fire

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.400 
against the heavy gunners and then fire
is<00:05:23.460> will<00:05:24.240> affect<00:05:24.539> the<00:05:24.630> heavy<00:05:24.780> gunners<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.350> the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
is will affect the heavy gunners and the

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.860 
is will affect the heavy gunners and the
Lancers<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.190> it's<00:05:26.970> just<00:05:27.180> it's<00:05:27.389> really<00:05:27.750> you

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
Lancers and it's just it's really you

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.300 
Lancers and it's just it's really you
just<00:05:28.050> used<00:05:28.229> fire<00:05:28.470> for<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.919> heavy<00:05:29.070> gunner

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
just used fire for the heavy gunner

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.500 
just used fire for the heavy gunner
because<00:05:29.490> they're<00:05:29.639> like<00:05:29.850> the<00:05:30.000> tanky<00:05:30.419> Asst

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
because they're like the tanky Asst

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.320 
because they're like the tanky Asst
unions<00:05:30.810> in<00:05:30.930> that<00:05:31.320> in<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.490> faction<00:05:32.910> basically

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
unions in that in that faction basically

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.909 
unions in that in that faction basically
if<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.510> can<00:05:33.539> call<00:05:33.870> it<00:05:33.960> that<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.289> that's<00:05:34.710> it

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
if you can call it that and that's it

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.430 
if you can call it that and that's it
guys<00:05:35.160> pretty<00:05:35.820> straightforward<00:05:36.030> build<00:05:36.960> it's<00:05:37.260> a

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
guys pretty straightforward build it's a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.589 
guys pretty straightforward build it's a
lot<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.800> fun<00:05:38.010> I'm<00:05:38.270> especially<00:05:39.270> when<00:05:39.479> you're

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
lot of fun I'm especially when you're

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.480 
lot of fun I'm especially when you're
using<00:05:39.750> Mirage<00:05:40.169> it's<00:05:40.650> just<00:05:40.919> like<00:05:41.070> explosions

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
using Mirage it's just like explosions

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.070 
using Mirage it's just like explosions
everywhere<00:05:41.940> so<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.240> highly<00:05:42.510> recommend<00:05:42.960> this

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
everywhere so I highly recommend this

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.650 
everywhere so I highly recommend this
weapon<00:05:43.470> now<00:05:43.620> it's<00:05:43.919> it<00:05:44.190> does<00:05:44.460> good<00:05:45.090> damage<00:05:45.330> I

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
weapon now it's it does good damage I

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.150 
weapon now it's it does good damage I
mean<00:05:45.810> it's<00:05:45.900> not<00:05:45.990> as<00:05:46.169> much<00:05:46.410> as<00:05:46.590> like<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.889> Paris

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
mean it's not as much as like the Paris

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.650 
mean it's not as much as like the Paris
prime<00:05:47.430> but<00:05:47.580> it's<00:05:47.729> still<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:47.880> lot<00:05:48.120> of<00:05:48.240> fun<00:05:48.450> and

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
prime but it's still a lot of fun and

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.779 
prime but it's still a lot of fun and
it's<00:05:49.200> a<00:05:49.349> good<00:05:49.590> a<00:05:49.800> we<00:05:50.039> clear<00:05:50.370> weapon<00:05:50.700> now

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
it's a good a we clear weapon now

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.909 
it's a good a we clear weapon now
especially<00:05:51.060> with<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.360> nerf<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.960> some<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.860> the

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
especially with the nerf to some of the
