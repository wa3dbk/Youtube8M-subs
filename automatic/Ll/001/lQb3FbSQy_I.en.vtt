00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.450
 real game and I am the gentleman 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.450

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.210

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.820
 and we will draw a very large monster and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:23.810
 terrifying now observe drawing a 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:30.180
 Round head with two protuberances 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:33.710

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.440
 line in the middle drawing two eyes 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.930
 creepy two wrinkles on the forehead and 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.649

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.060

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.240
 we finish it looks really good but 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.240
 do not militate scares a dragon so 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.790

 I am very kind friend but if you want 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.689
 I can fire 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.540
 is very impressive truth I think that 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.540
 we should look for another game 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.260
 to make a dragon first of all 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:21.360
 draw a round head with two 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.120
 protuberances above then do a great 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.030
 mouth and a line in the middle now 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.780
 draw two spooky eyes and two 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.910
 wrinkles of the forehead says that it is not a 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.789
 curve for the study and then one leg 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:44.229
 for the tail draws a line as a 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:48.210
 snake then you go back to the head and 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.780
 Now you can draw the other legs 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.520
 do not 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.520
 and its scales 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:06.979
 and most importantly do not forget your time 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.979
 and you can paint it as you want 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.189
 cute 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.860
 yes 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.210
 i 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:27.889
 but do not worry there is a very villain 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:33.280
 very very good and a dragon very joker 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:36.720
 now we can play all together 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.720
 get away dragon 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.699
