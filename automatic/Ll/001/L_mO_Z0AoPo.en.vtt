I<00:00:06.180> think<00:00:07.180> it's<00:00:07.330> important<00:00:07.870> that<00:00:07.960> the<00:00:08.410> World

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
I think it's important that the World

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.250 
I think it's important that the World

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
phone use as a potential cancer risk and

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779 
phone use as a potential cancer risk and
I<00:00:16.240> agree<00:00:16.510> with<00:00:16.690> the<00:00:16.810> conclusion<00:00:17.380> I<00:00:17.530> think<00:00:18.100> what

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
I agree with the conclusion I think what

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.460 
I agree with the conclusion I think what
really<00:00:19.000> pertains<00:00:19.780> here<00:00:20.199> is<00:00:20.320> the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
really pertains here is the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.519 
really pertains here is the
precautionary<00:00:21.100> principle<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.779> burden<00:00:23.439> of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
precautionary principle the burden of

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.970 
precautionary principle the burden of
proof<00:00:23.859> is<00:00:24.279> on<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:26.050> industry<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:26.679> on<00:00:26.800> those

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
proof is on the industry and on those

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.579 
proof is on the industry and on those
who<00:00:27.310> want<00:00:27.640> to<00:00:27.910> say<00:00:28.150> there<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.140> no<00:00:29.169> risk

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
who want to say there is no risk

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.850 
who want to say there is no risk
involved<00:00:30.330> people<00:00:31.330> need<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.480> be<00:00:31.660> aware<00:00:31.860> that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
involved people need to be aware that

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.400 
involved people need to be aware that
there<00:00:33.490> is<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:34.120> epidemiological<00:00:35.079> data<00:00:35.290> out

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
there is this epidemiological data out

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.390 
there is this epidemiological data out
there<00:00:35.500> that's<00:00:35.829> linking<00:00:37.350> electromagnetic

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
there that's linking electromagnetic

there that's linking electromagnetic
radiation<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.580> health<00:00:40.270> effects<00:00:40.660> so<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.260> think

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
radiation and health effects so I think

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.600 
radiation and health effects so I think
it's<00:00:41.830> not<00:00:42.220> unwise<00:00:43.060> to<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:45.370> precautions

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
it's not unwise to take precautions

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's not unwise to take precautions
meaning<00:00:46.600> for<00:00:46.930> example<00:00:47.470> instead<00:00:47.800> of<00:00:48.040> having

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
meaning for example instead of having

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.030 
meaning for example instead of having
the<00:00:48.490> cell<00:00:48.700> phone<00:00:48.910> up<00:00:49.120> against<00:00:49.420> your<00:00:49.630> ear<00:00:50.040> you

the cell phone up against your ear you

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.040 
the cell phone up against your ear you
could<00:00:51.220> have<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:52.260> microphone<00:00:53.260> that's<00:00:53.950> distant

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
could have a microphone that's distant

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620 
could have a microphone that's distant
such<00:00:56.050> as<00:00:56.260> on<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.650> cord<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.850> can<00:00:57.880> talk<00:00:58.240> into<00:00:58.450> the

such as on a cord you can talk into the

course<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.240> big<00:01:01.390> worry<00:01:01.630> is<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:02.520> children

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
course the big worry is that children

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.870 
course the big worry is that children
are<00:01:03.640> now<00:01:03.850> using<00:01:04.350> mobile<00:01:05.350> phones<00:01:05.880> extensively

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
are now using mobile phones extensively

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.240 
are now using mobile phones extensively
and<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:08.020> was<00:01:08.200> never<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> case<00:01:08.560> before<00:01:08.920> so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
and that was never the case before so

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.430 
and that was never the case before so
we're<00:01:09.369> now<00:01:09.520> looking<00:01:10.030> for<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.510> first<00:01:10.750> time<00:01:11.020> at

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
we're now looking for the first time at

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.190 
we're now looking for the first time at
life<00:01:12.040> long<00:01:12.310> exposure<00:01:12.790> decades<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.810> exposure

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
life long exposure decades of exposure

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.350 
life long exposure decades of exposure
and<00:01:14.530> nobody<00:01:15.430> knows<00:01:15.700> what<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.060> implications

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
and nobody knows what the implications

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.990 
and nobody knows what the implications
of<00:01:16.930> that<00:01:16.990> might<00:01:17.320> be<00:01:17.530> when<00:01:18.220> my<00:01:18.430> 8<00:01:18.640> month<00:01:18.670> old

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
of that might be when my 8 month old

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.510 
of that might be when my 8 month old
grandson<00:01:19.570> showed<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.350> he<00:01:20.500> was<00:01:20.530> really<00:01:21.220> smart

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
grandson showed that he was really smart

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.000 
grandson showed that he was really smart
with<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.880> phone<00:01:22.210> I<00:01:22.600> began<00:01:23.409> to<00:01:23.500> get<00:01:23.590> curious

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
with a phone I began to get curious

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.980 
with a phone I began to get curious
about<00:01:24.670> what<00:01:24.790> we<00:01:24.909> knew<00:01:25.000> about<00:01:25.030> cell<00:01:25.450> phones<00:01:25.480> and

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
about what we knew about cell phones and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.800 
about what we knew about cell phones and
what<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.800> found<00:01:27.130> really<00:01:27.460> concerned<00:01:28.360> me<00:01:28.480> I

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
what I found really concerned me I

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.720 
what I found really concerned me I
learned<00:01:29.440> that<00:01:29.560> other<00:01:29.800> countries<00:01:30.070> namely

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
learned that other countries namely

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.210 
learned that other countries namely
Israel<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.750> England<00:01:32.200> had<00:01:32.650> already<00:01:32.800> issued

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
Israel and England had already issued

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.680 
Israel and England had already issued
warnings<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.760> children<00:01:34.270> should<00:01:34.390> not<00:01:34.479> even

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
warnings that children should not even

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.719 
warnings that children should not even
use<00:01:34.870> cell<00:01:35.170> phones<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:35.979> began<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.610> do

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
use cell phones then I began to do

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.760 
use cell phones then I began to do
research<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:37.270> this<00:01:37.420> about<00:01:37.720> seven<00:01:38.470> years<00:01:38.590> ago

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
research on this about seven years ago

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.610 
research on this about seven years ago
the<00:01:39.280> brain<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.909> child<00:01:40.210> absorbs<00:01:40.720> twice<00:01:41.409> as

much radiation as an adult that's a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.810 
much radiation as an adult that's a
stunning<00:01:44.350> fact<00:01:44.590> few<00:01:44.950> people<00:01:45.250> are<00:01:45.340> aware<00:01:45.370> of<00:01:45.640> it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
stunning fact few people are aware of it

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.330

they're<00:01:55.240> benign<00:01:55.690> devices<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.760> certainly

they're benign devices and certainly

uses a lot it's in close proximity to
the<00:02:03.369> body<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.690> think<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.110> not

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
the body so I think it's not

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.309 
the body so I think it's not
unreasonable<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:06.330> inform<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.840> consumers

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
unreasonable to inform the consumers

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.250 
unreasonable to inform the consumers
about<00:02:09.739> these<00:02:10.069> effects<00:02:10.579> and<00:02:11.260> giving

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
about these effects and giving

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.220 
about these effects and giving
information<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:13.159> allows<00:02:13.939> the<00:02:14.780> consumer<00:02:14.930> to
