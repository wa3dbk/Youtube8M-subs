those<00:02:37.940> needs<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> last<00:02:39.560> thing<00:02:39.860> is

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
those needs and then the last thing is

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.990 
those needs and then the last thing is
that<00:02:40.100> quality<00:02:41.590> reliability<00:02:42.590> dependability

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
that quality reliability dependability

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.300 
that quality reliability dependability

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.780 
because if a commercial vehicle is down
that<00:02:47.239> guy's<00:02:47.510> losing<00:02:47.810> money<00:02:48.230> so<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.160> has<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.640> be

closer to launch will have the pricing

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.870 
closer to launch will have the pricing
on<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.320> we'll<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:46.310> fuel<00:04:46.580> economy

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
on it and we'll have the fuel economy

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.480 
on it and we'll have the fuel economy
numbers<00:04:47.180> all<00:04:47.810> out<00:04:48.380> as<00:04:48.680> we<00:04:49.130> get<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.310> little

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
actually took these out on the proving

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.040 
actually took these out on the proving
grounds<00:04:58.430> over<00:04:58.760> in<00:04:58.940> Italy<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.600> just<00:04:59.870> had<00:05:00.020> a

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
ball with them so certainly we can have

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
ball with them so certainly we can have
a<00:05:03.200> lot<00:05:03.380> of<00:05:03.410> fun<00:05:03.710> with<00:05:03.919> it

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
a lot of fun with it

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.030 
a lot of fun with it
all<00:05:04.520> right<00:05:04.669> you<00:05:04.910> are<00:05:05.060> aware<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:06.040> Chevy's

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
all right you are aware that Chevy's

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.880 
all right you are aware that Chevy's
also<00:05:07.400> called<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:07.669> city<00:05:07.850> of<00:05:07.940> just<00:05:08.470> yeah<00:05:09.470> but<00:05:09.740> we

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
also called the city of just yeah but we

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.220 
also called the city of just yeah but we
came<00:05:10.070> out<00:05:10.310> first<00:05:10.700> with<00:05:11.030> our<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.630> and<00:05:11.930> then<00:05:12.080> they

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
came out first with our so and then they

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.870 
came out first with our so and then they
followed<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.040> makes<00:05:13.250> sense<00:05:13.490> when<00:05:13.850> you

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
followed it but it makes sense when you

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.350 
followed it but it makes sense when you
look<00:05:14.240> at<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.570> but<00:05:14.750> we<00:05:15.590> followed<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.250> same

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
look at it but we followed the same

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.670 
look at it but we followed the same
nomenclature<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.600> we<00:05:17.780> did<00:05:17.990> with<00:05:18.200> our<00:05:18.440> class

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
nomenclature that we did with our class

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.070 
nomenclature that we did with our class
tube<00:05:19.040> and<00:05:19.310> with<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.610> Promaster<00:05:20.419> this<00:05:20.780> is<00:05:20.960> the

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
tube and with a Promaster this is the

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
I said best-in-class fuel economy

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.990 
I said best-in-class fuel economy
best-in-class<00:05:50.200> cargo<00:05:50.710> capacity<00:05:51.220> so<00:05:51.970> that
