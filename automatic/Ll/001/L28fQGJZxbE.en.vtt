guess<00:02:06.969> about<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.299> mean<00:02:07.600> greco-roman<00:02:08.080> wrestling

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
guess about I mean greco-roman wrestling

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.740 
guess about I mean greco-roman wrestling
I<00:02:08.799> mean<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.129> is<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.610> roots<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.330> Olympics

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750

I mean that is the roots of the Olympics
I<00:02:10.869> mean<00:02:11.019> that's<00:02:11.170> what<00:02:11.290> they<00:02:11.349> first<00:02:11.590> were

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
I mean that's what they first were

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.630 
I mean that's what they first were
competing<00:02:12.010> way<00:02:12.250> back<00:02:12.519> when<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.630> know<00:02:14.640> it's

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
something that even in my rested today

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.620 
something that even in my rested today

we're<00:04:50.080> still<00:04:50.260> stand<00:04:50.590> up<00:04:50.740> so<00:04:50.889> they've

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
we're still stand up so they've

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.500 
we're still stand up so they've
incorporated<00:04:51.310> with<00:04:51.729> the<00:04:51.820> calling<00:04:52.150> not<00:04:52.389> an

incorporated with the calling not an
activity<00:04:53.260> rule<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:53.680> they

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
activity rule so they

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.029 
activity rule so they
neither<00:04:54.840> one<00:04:55.139> is<00:04:55.169> gaining<00:04:55.590> an<00:04:55.919> advantage

neither one is gaining an advantage
though<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.490> stop<00:04:56.819> it<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.210> restart<00:04:57.690> them<00:04:57.780> up

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
though to stop it and restart them up

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.240 
though to stop it and restart them up
against<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:58.380> again<00:04:59.039> these<00:04:59.310> are<00:04:59.370> ways<00:04:59.870> it's<00:05:00.870> a
