00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hey people you have me at the instagram 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.430
 asked if I can show you how 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.930
 I did this hairstyle and me 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.849
 had me at the same time, two other 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.290
 selected and my favorite hairstyle 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.010
 I would like to show you today I wish 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.929
 have fun 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.400
 First of all, you have to Taylor swift 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.699
 dance and then you can do this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 hairstyles would make no nonsense 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.550
 We start directly with this 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.689
 Hairstyle and that's what I do 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.430
 usually always first 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.350
 middle parting and share my hair 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.939
 in two games we're on both 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.320
 have about the same number of hairs 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 if you have a pony now then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.830
 leave the outside I unfortunately have no 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.870
 pony i just have long hair up front 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.420
 But we will correct that later 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.920
 They look like we have short hair 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.540
 So even with long hair in the front can 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.129
 you do that well and then we catch 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.790
 on one side at the back the hair too 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.290
 weave 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.300
 pay attention that you have the hair 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.800
 lichen directly upward from the batch 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 so that he does not have a planer there later 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.230
 created 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 and if I am about five to six times 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.629
 plaited down then I start 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 to loosen up the whole thing 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.539
 because I just think that's nicer 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 So looks like I pull my 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.449
 individual strands then a bit 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.129
 out and then maybe not further 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.270
 do the same again and do that 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.160
 whole with a very thin like 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.730
 firm and on the other side exactly 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.589
 the same thing 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.180
 Now we have the two in front 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.130
 strive for in my opinion a bit too 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.450
 long are appear around the short 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.520
 I just take one 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 rove they bickel once two 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 finger around it and then have such a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.600
 small hole and this week I put 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.950
 then just lay flat on my head and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.900
 do it firmly with bobby pins 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 right where I punch this little hole 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.979
 have done exactly the other side 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.390
 the same thing at two fingers around 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.950
 turn and then the fingers go out there 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 there you have automatically hole and there 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.100
 Can you arrange that how long you can 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.299
 that would like her to be on both 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.170
 pages are the same length and then 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.790
 just get stuck 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 Now we take from the sides of the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.619
 surface and place exactly where 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.270
 we just stuck and also 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.680
 dalli bobby pins no longer you and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.570
 make the surfaces on the other side 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 Hard if he still puts things out like that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.759
 if your hair is too long for 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.439
 you can just go upstairs 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.000
 click and then place again 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.180
 do 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.680
 Here we take the other side 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.680
 that we hide the ends 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 maybe once among the others 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.680
 do that again with bobby 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.790
 Pins stuck and if the pages are one 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.899
 then you can do that 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.070
 just hide again then 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.060
 I use my curling iron and me 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.500
 nevertheless you and in the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.240
 infobox because I always have many 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.180
 People ask me if I use and I 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.950
 always use the lemmings ci 6 means 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.590
 he thinks I'm losing everyone 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 fall in the infobox and then I knock 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.550
 my hair just easily after 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.660
 outside that I also like to do 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.400
 just pull your hair apart 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.330
 so that we do not have such a strand 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 but that so a bit 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.270
 looks messy and so several 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.410
 are in front are 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.910
 that's really my goto at the moment 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.980
 I love to wear them 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.270
 and this also super easy and fast 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.709
 and she's really good for that anyway 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.930
 second hairstyle we need one first 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.950
 wide side vertex and lay all 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.050
 hair whether a side 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.970
 then we can take a part in front 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.350
 you can cut the crucial one off 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.910
 but I wanted to share big ideas 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.739
 do not have it that big now 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.890
 made and then catch the whole 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.930
 to braid normally 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.450
 Here, too, I relax after a few 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.890
 weaves the whole thing up again and again 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.310
 Do that downstairs with a little one 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.560
 me and then I take all 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.989
 my hair as well as the area share 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.160
 the whole in three strive of maybe 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.160
 she then down again 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.610
 Here I can lure the whole because on 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.410
 finish it again and then I put it down 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.519
 my hair back in a circle 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.870
 and unfortunately the camera is right there 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.610
 I just wanted to add on 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.840
 but I've definitely turned around 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.360
 I just put my hair in a circle 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.140
 turned and then start to bobby with her 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.140
 pins stuck 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.910
 around the hairstyle then so again 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.680
 to get a bit messy kai 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.120
 I like to pull some hair over there 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.560
 go ahead and loose the whole in too 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.380
 I finger my up a bit 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.310
 go in 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.310
 so that does not look too strict 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.800
 we come to my third 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.210
 We need a favorite book clock for this 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.840
 very very wide sides switch so 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.400
 West would have come to one side then 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.570
 I look at the side where the hair changes 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.770
 pinned it with the hair too 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.030
 really stay where they stay 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.500
 should and then I take one in front 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.300
 dash and start to the very whole 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.860
 braid down so really 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.770
 braid only about the shoulder 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.300
 and then we do a franchise 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.360
 by getting further from the back 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.800
 take hair but do the whole thing 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.790
 as we weave down 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.880
 So if you come back from the side 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.510
 few hair with bad back to you 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.340
 from the bottom again a few hairs with so 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.640
 that we really loose all this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.640
 to have 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.350
 and if you then all hair from below 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.150
 may have intertwined with the whole 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.200
 fix with a bubblegum and then 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.120
 I'll lighten it up a bit 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.200
 and the nice thing about this hairstyle in 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.730
 contrary to a normal three 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.680
 wisps for I just think that the 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.260
 many voluminous looks at mine 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.820
 That would not be that big by far 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.860
 Been up and so I find her that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.240
 like you have a lot of hair because 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.660
 he might just look that big 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.650
 and that would be my third favorite music 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.060
 I'll link you here two more 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.350

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.210

 and whether he is such a simple everyday 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.570
 hairstyles favorite pants wrote there 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.280
 I wonder what that one is or

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.100
