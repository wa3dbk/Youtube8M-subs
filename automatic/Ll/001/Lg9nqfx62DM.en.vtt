piece<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> sounded<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:21.869> similar<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
piece that sounded very similar to that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.530 
piece that sounded very similar to that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
there trying to write a couple riffs

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.810 
there trying to write a couple riffs
with<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> piece<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.829> seeing<00:01:29.070> what<00:01:29.490> kind<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
with the piece just seeing what kind of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.950 
with the piece just seeing what kind of
stuff<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.090> could<00:01:30.270> come<00:01:30.450> up<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
stuff I could come up with and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the layers a little bit that way you get

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.590

now<00:03:03.530> you'll<00:03:03.859> notice<00:03:04.249> that<00:03:04.400> when<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.579> play<00:03:04.819> each

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
now you'll notice that when I play each

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.420 
now you'll notice that when I play each
section<00:03:05.719> of<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.870> song<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.739> can<00:03:06.920> still<00:03:07.219> hear

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
section of the song you can still hear

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.989 
section of the song you can still hear
the<00:03:07.609> rest

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:07.999 
the rest

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.300 
the rest
playing<00:03:08.239> very<00:03:08.450> clearly<00:03:09.019> that's<00:03:09.680> because<00:03:10.069> of

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
playing very clearly that's because of

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.459 
playing very clearly that's because of
mixing<00:03:10.819> when<00:03:11.180> mixing<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.629> song<00:03:11.659> you<00:03:12.260> have<00:03:12.379> to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
mixing when mixing a song you have to

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.289 
mixing when mixing a song you have to
recognize<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.920> every<00:03:13.430> single<00:03:13.639> instruments

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
recognize that every single instruments

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.539 
recognize that every single instruments
occupies<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> very<00:03:15.260> specific<00:03:15.620> space<00:03:16.189> in<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
occupies a very specific space in the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.550 
occupies a very specific space in the
mix<00:03:16.760> for<00:03:17.329> drums<00:03:17.629> you<00:03:17.749> up<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> kick<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.379> low

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
mix for drums you up the kick in the low

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.379 
mix for drums you up the kick in the low
end<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.340> snare<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.639> cymbals<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.269> the

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
end and the snare and cymbals in the

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.539 
end and the snare and cymbals in the
upper<00:03:20.659> mids<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.019> highs<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.590> like<00:03:22.189> the<00:03:22.340> bass

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
upper mids the highs I like the bass

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.580 
upper mids the highs I like the bass
guitar<00:03:23.000> even<00:03:23.239> lower<00:03:23.599> than<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.959> drums<00:03:24.200> with<00:03:24.560> a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
guitar even lower than the drums with a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.619 
guitar even lower than the drums with a
little<00:03:24.920> bit<00:03:25.040> of<00:03:25.069> mids<00:03:25.370> for<00:03:25.579> definition<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.239> so

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
little bit of mids for definition and so

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.270 
little bit of mids for definition and so
it<00:03:26.750> doesn't<00:03:27.049> compete<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.439> bring<00:03:27.739> down<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:27.980> lows

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
it doesn't compete I bring down the lows

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.800 
it doesn't compete I bring down the lows
and<00:03:28.310> race<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.849> mids<00:03:29.030> for<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.269> rhythm<00:03:29.389> guitar

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
and race the mids for the rhythm guitar

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.690 
and race the mids for the rhythm guitar
and<00:03:29.959> then<00:03:30.500> for<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.739> lead<00:03:30.889> guitar<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
and then for the lead guitar I do the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.580 
and then for the lead guitar I do the
same<00:03:31.969> while<00:03:32.269> boosting<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.840> highs<00:03:33.019> even<00:03:33.379> more

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
same while boosting the highs even more

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.890 
same while boosting the highs even more

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
each other and brings the song a lot of

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.709 
each other and brings the song a lot of
clarity<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.939> sometimes<00:03:44.419> you<00:03:44.510> wouldn't
