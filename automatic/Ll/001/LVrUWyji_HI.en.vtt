whole row on the other side it looks
like<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.520> engine<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.910> here's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
like this for engine so there here's

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.880 
like this for engine so there here's
here's<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.809> good<00:01:04.019> picture<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:05.060> what<00:01:06.060> he's<00:01:06.210> done

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it wasn't nailed the end would cup up

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.350 
it wasn't nailed the end would cup up
like<00:01:16.439> yeah<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> looked<00:01:17.909> okay<00:01:18.150> now

like yeah like that it looked okay now
see<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.900> between<00:01:19.200> trusses<00:01:19.890> here's<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
see we're in between trusses here's a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.640 
see we're in between trusses here's a
truss<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.840> stiff

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
truss right there there's that's stiff

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.120 
truss right there there's that's stiff
here's<00:01:23.159> trust<00:01:23.610> yes<00:01:24.530> here's<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.740> between

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
here's trust yes here's the in between

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
here's trust yes here's the in between
in<00:01:26.700> between<00:01:26.759> there's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> truss<00:01:27.869> right<00:01:28.170> there

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
in between there's a truss right there

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.710 
in between there's a truss right there
yeah

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.120 

you<00:01:32.710> know<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.430> think<00:01:33.670> I<00:01:34.090> think<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.750> male

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you know and I think I think it is male

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060 
you know and I think I think it is male
probably<00:01:36.130> it<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.520> nailed<00:01:36.880> right<00:01:37.590> Jim<00:01:38.620> is<00:01:38.800> just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
probably it is nailed right Jim is just

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.530 
probably it is nailed right Jim is just
that<00:01:39.280> it's<00:01:39.490> taken<00:01:40.440> he's<00:01:41.440> higher<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:43.330> that's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
that it's taken he's higher so so that's

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.910 
that it's taken he's higher so so that's
what<00:01:43.690> we're<00:01:43.840> getting<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.170> sponge<00:01:44.440> out<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.680> it

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
what we're getting the sponge out of it

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.460 
what we're getting the sponge out of it
his<00:01:45.100> real<00:01:45.400> on<00:01:45.610> is<00:01:45.730> higher<00:01:45.940> in<00:01:46.090> his<00:01:46.330> master<00:01:46.690> yeah

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
his real on is higher in his master yeah

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
his real on is higher in his master yeah
he<00:01:47.680> didn't<00:01:47.920> match<00:01:48.070> it

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
he didn't match it

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.090 
he didn't match it
he<00:01:49.030> didn't<00:01:49.240> match<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.660> right<00:01:49.870> so<00:01:50.500> it's<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:50.950> a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
he didn't match it right so it's it's a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.320 
he didn't match it right so it's it's a
little<00:01:51.310> bit<00:01:51.400> as<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.610> can<00:01:51.820> see<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.150> higher

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
little bit as you can see it's higher

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.880 
little bit as you can see it's higher
yeah<00:01:52.960> yeah<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.250> she<00:01:54.460> dad<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.560> could<00:01:56.800> have
