00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
power suppose you could play maybe but

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.260 
power suppose you could play maybe but
it<00:01:31.870> probably<00:01:32.080> wouldn't<00:01:32.380> turn<00:01:32.710> out<00:01:32.920> too<00:01:33.190> well

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it probably wouldn't turn out too well

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560 
it probably wouldn't turn out too well
right<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.540> his<00:01:34.840> Q<00:01:35.230> which<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.920> shackle<00:01:36.700> that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
right and his Q which is shackle that

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.400 
right and his Q which is shackle that
basically<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:39.280> passively<00:01:39.910> deals<00:01:40.330> damage<00:01:40.660> with

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
basically it passively deals damage with

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.830 
basically it passively deals damage with
each<00:01:41.560> hit<00:01:42.000> equal<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.300> souls<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.780> have

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
each hit equal to the souls that have

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.700 
it's kind of like a blitzcrank pull but
it's<00:01:51.160> also<00:01:51.340> not<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:52.600> won't<00:01:52.930> instantly<00:01:53.470> pull

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
it's also not it won't instantly pull

range I can show you this one right now

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.940 
range I can show you this one right now
because<00:02:20.930> obviously<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.470> don't<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.830> any

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
because obviously I don't have any

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.130 
because obviously I don't have any
allies<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.490> teleport<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.150> me<00:02:23.300> another<00:02:23.930> good

allies to teleport to me another good
thing<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.620> shows<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.340> area<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.510> basically

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
thing is it shows the area so basically

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.280 
thing is it shows the area so basically
as<00:02:27.800> long<00:02:27.830> as<00:02:28.130> that's<00:02:28.310> done<00:02:28.400> if<00:02:28.730> an<00:02:28.850> ally

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
as long as that's done if an ally

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.120 
as long as that's done if an ally
basically<00:02:30.290> clicked<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:30.740> they<00:02:31.040> were

is the box trapped enemies inside the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.080 
is the box trapped enemies inside the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
walls would slow and deal damage if

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.790 
walls would slow and deal damage if
broken<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.630> basically<00:03:08.989> like<00:03:09.200> Vegas<00:03:09.739> done

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
broken it's basically like Vegas done
