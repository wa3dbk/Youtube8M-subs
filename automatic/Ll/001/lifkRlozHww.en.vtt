00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
times in that amount of time and it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
times in that amount of time and it's
something<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.689> I'm<00:00:27.900> pretty<00:00:28.109> happy<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.650> in

feedback you guys have before I end up
starting<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.090> build<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.379> before<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.040> look

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
starting to build this so before we look

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.260 
starting to build this so before we look
at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.239> full<00:00:45.510> 3d<00:00:46.020> render<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.789> wanted

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
at the full 3d render of this I wanted

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.350 
at the full 3d render of this I wanted
to<00:00:48.360> very<00:00:48.570> quickly<00:00:48.780> take<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> look<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to very quickly take a look at the the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.020 
to very quickly take a look at the the
floor<00:00:51.660> plan<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> 2d<00:00:52.590> layout<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.730> let<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
floor plan of the 2d layout to let you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.790 
floor plan of the 2d layout to let you
guys<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.320> I've

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
guys know kind of what it is I've

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.610 
guys know kind of what it is I've
designed<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> plan<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.020> doing<00:00:58.079> here

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
designed and what I plan on doing here

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
designed and what I plan on doing here
so<00:00:59.309> you'll<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.210> five<00:01:00.660> tanks<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.559> on

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so you'll see I have five tanks here on

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.759 
so you'll see I have five tanks here on
the<00:01:02.100> floor<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.049> constructed

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the floor and it's kind of constructed

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.370 
the floor and it's kind of constructed
in<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.339> modular<00:01:05.640> fashion<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:07.080> two

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
in a modular fashion so that these two

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.969 
in a modular fashion so that these two
tanks<00:01:07.950> share<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.180> central<00:01:09.780> racking<00:01:10.530> system

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
tanks share a central racking system

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.420 
tanks share a central racking system
these<00:01:11.490> two<00:01:11.880> tanks<00:01:12.390> share<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> central<00:01:13.979> racking

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
these two tanks share a central racking

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
these two tanks share a central racking
system<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.450> end<00:01:15.689> cap<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
system and then this end cap kind of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.249 
system and then this end cap kind of
connects<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.280> those<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.180> those<00:01:18.390> five<00:01:18.750> tanks

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
connects to those so those five tanks

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
connects to those so those five tanks
are<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.070> three<00:01:20.700> tiers

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
are actually going to be three tiers

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.870 
are actually going to be three tiers
tall<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.080> we've<00:01:22.259> got<00:01:22.380> 15<00:01:22.619> tanks<00:01:23.159> total<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
tall so we've got 15 tanks total and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.140 
tall so we've got 15 tanks total and
that<00:01:24.170> represents<00:01:25.170> phase<00:01:25.500> 1<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.759> fish

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that represents phase 1 of this fish

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.050 
that represents phase 1 of this fish
room<00:01:27.450> build<00:01:27.750> you'll<00:01:28.680> notice<00:01:28.920> I've<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
room build you'll notice I've got the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.679 
room build you'll notice I've got the
exact<00:01:30.450> same<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:31.049> over<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.240> i<00:01:33.240> also

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
exact same thing over here and i also

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.219 
exact same thing over here and i also
have<00:01:34.700> three<00:01:35.700> additional<00:01:36.329> tanks<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
have three additional tanks here and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.060 
have three additional tanks here and
that<00:01:37.979> represents<00:01:38.909> phase<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.650> fish

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that represents phase two of the fish

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
that represents phase two of the fish
room<00:01:41.220> build<00:01:41.670> phase<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> kick

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
room build phase one is going to kick

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
room build phase one is going to kick
off<00:01:43.439> here<00:01:43.770> pretty<00:01:44.040> soon<00:01:44.369> within<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.939> next

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
off here pretty soon within the next

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.389 
off here pretty soon within the next
month<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.560> phase<00:01:46.860> two<00:01:47.189> will

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
month or so and then phase two will

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
month or so and then phase two will
follow<00:01:47.640> after<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.329> once<00:01:48.930> phase<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> up

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
follow after that once phase one is up

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.730 
follow after that once phase one is up
and<00:01:50.009> running<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:51.270> pretty<00:01:51.540> good<00:01:51.600> shape<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and running and in pretty good shape so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.530 
and running and in pretty good shape so
just<00:01:53.490> quickly<00:01:55.340> we'll<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> look<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.090> this

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
just quickly we'll take a look at this

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.450 
just quickly we'll take a look at this
2d<00:01:58.020> model<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.740> we'll<00:01:58.920> switch<00:01:59.070> over<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
2d model and then we'll switch over to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.480 
2d model and then we'll switch over to
the<00:01:59.610> 3d<00:01:59.939> model<00:02:00.290> in<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.710> corner<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> left

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the 3d model in this corner in the left

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.120 
the 3d model in this corner in the left
corner<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.329> three<00:02:03.840> stage<00:02:04.259> central

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
corner we have a three stage central

center column to the house which is
going<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.970> be<00:02:45.060> riding<00:02:45.630> very<00:02:45.900> close<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:47.100> this

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
going to be riding very close to this

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.990 
going to be riding very close to this
first<00:02:47.760> bank<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.530> tanks<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.790> that's<00:02:50.790> something

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
first bank of tanks and that's something

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.210 
first bank of tanks and that's something
that<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.300> absolutely<00:02:51.960> can't<00:02:52.260> move<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.950> it's

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
that I absolutely can't move and it's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.350 
that I absolutely can't move and it's
something<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.880> kind<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.150> work

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
something that I have to kind of work

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.740 
something that I have to kind of work
around<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:55.410> you'll<00:02:55.650> notice<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.340> while<00:02:57.300> this

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
around so you'll notice that while this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.230 
around so you'll notice that while this
set<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.350> tanks<00:02:58.770> are<00:02:58.950> 40<00:02:59.370> gallon<00:02:59.700> breeders<00:03:00.060> and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
set of tanks are 40 gallon breeders and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.630 
set of tanks are 40 gallon breeders and
this<00:03:01.110> set<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.500> techniques<00:03:01.800> are<00:03:01.980> 40<00:03:02.310> gallon

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
this set of techniques are 40 gallon

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.760 
this set of techniques are 40 gallon
breeders<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.210> needed<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.020> reduce<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.590> height

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
breeders I needed to reduce the height

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.630 
breeders I needed to reduce the height
on<00:03:05.240> this<00:03:06.240> set<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.660> tanks<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.220> may<00:03:08.610> end

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
on this set of tanks and so this may end

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.480 
on this set of tanks and so this may end
up<00:03:08.940> being<00:03:09.000> 30<00:03:09.630> gallon<00:03:10.080> breeders<00:03:10.440> or<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:11.130> might

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
up being 30 gallon breeders or I might

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.420 
up being 30 gallon breeders or I might
just<00:03:11.760> cut<00:03:12.120> off<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.390> top<00:03:12.930> 40<00:03:13.860> gallon<00:03:14.220> breeder

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
just cut off the top 40 gallon breeder

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.960 
just cut off the top 40 gallon breeder
and<00:03:14.730> leave<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.630> two<00:03:15.900> tanks<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.850> can

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and leave it to two tanks so that it can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.900 
and leave it to two tanks so that it can
squeeze<00:03:18.360> underneath<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.650> beam<00:03:19.980> here<00:03:20.280> so

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
squeeze underneath this beam here so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
squeeze underneath this beam here so
that's<00:03:21.150> kind<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.540> layout<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.410> room

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
that's kind of the layout of this room

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.340 
that's kind of the layout of this room
as<00:03:23.340> you'll<00:03:23.730> remember<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.780> staircase

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
as you'll remember this is the staircase

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.280 
as you'll remember this is the staircase
down<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.520> doorway<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.900> have<00:03:28.080> an

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
down this is a doorway in we have an

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.560 
down this is a doorway in we have an
electrical<00:03:28.800> closet<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.730> which<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.510> to

electrical closet here which is going to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.380 
electrical closet here which is going to
be<00:03:30.660> taken<00:03:31.110> out<00:03:31.350> but<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.400> electrical<00:03:32.880> panel<00:03:33.030> is

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
be taken out but the electrical panel is

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.630 
be taken out but the electrical panel is
very<00:03:33.600> much<00:03:33.840> going<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.230> stay<00:03:34.530> there<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.489> we've

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
going to come together if we look at

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.690 
going to come together if we look at

this fully rendered 3d version of the
tank<00:04:08.970> rack<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.540> see<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:10.980> it's

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
tank rack you can see that it's it's

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.300 
tank rack you can see that it's it's
about<00:04:11.880> four<00:04:12.239> inches<00:04:12.540> off<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.750> ground<00:04:13.310> we've

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
about four inches off the ground we've

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.039 
about four inches off the ground we've
got<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.550> two-by-four<00:04:14.970> which<00:04:15.390> runs<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.959> entire

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
got a two-by-four which runs the entire

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.729 
got a two-by-four which runs the entire
length<00:04:16.430> that's<00:04:17.430> going<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.060> be<00:04:18.150> load

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
length that's going to be load

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.860 
length that's going to be load
this<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.459> one<00:04:19.639> of<00:04:19.669> those<00:04:19.880> in<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.209> front<00:04:20.509> and<00:04:20.720> is

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
this is one of those in the front and is

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.020 
this is one of those in the front and is
one<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.079> those<00:04:21.229> in<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.560> back<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:22.069> then<00:04:22.699> we<00:04:22.849> do

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
one of those in the back and then we do

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.749 
one of those in the back and then we do
have<00:04:23.210> two<00:04:23.449> by<00:04:23.630> fours<00:04:24.069> which<00:04:25.069> kind<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.550> up

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
have two by fours which kind of go up

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.240 
have two by fours which kind of go up
the<00:04:25.940> sides<00:04:26.210> here<00:04:26.539> those<00:04:27.319> are<00:04:27.740> going<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.130> be

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
the sides here those are going to be

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.760 
the sides here those are going to be
load-bearing<00:04:28.550> as<00:04:29.120> well<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:29.720> if<00:04:30.289> we<00:04:30.440> look<00:04:30.620> at

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
load-bearing as well and if we look at

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.059 
load-bearing as well and if we look at
this<00:04:31.009> from<00:04:31.220> an<00:04:31.430> angle<00:04:32.289> we<00:04:33.289> can<00:04:33.470> see<00:04:33.800> that

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:34.069 
this from an angle we can see that

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.790 
this from an angle we can see that
there's<00:04:34.310> an<00:04:34.430> additional<00:04:34.729> 2<00:04:35.330> by<00:04:35.539> 4<00:04:35.870> which<00:04:36.410> makes

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
there's an additional 2 by 4 which makes

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.629 
there's an additional 2 by 4 which makes
this<00:04:37.099> essentially<00:04:37.819> a<00:04:37.849> 4<00:04:38.180> by<00:04:38.360> 4<00:04:38.389> and<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:39.639> that

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
this essentially a 4 by 4 and that that

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.640 
this essentially a 4 by 4 and that that
piece<00:04:40.910> of<00:04:40.940> wood<00:04:41.330> goes<00:04:41.630> all<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.930> way<00:04:42.289> from<00:04:42.349> the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
piece of wood goes all the way from the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.650 
piece of wood goes all the way from the
bottom<00:04:43.039> all<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.400> way<00:04:43.430> up<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.729> top<00:04:43.819> it's

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
bottom all the way up to the top it's

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.510 
bottom all the way up to the top it's
not<00:04:44.930> interrupted<00:04:45.740> it's<00:04:45.949> something<00:04:46.310> that's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
not interrupted it's something that's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.670 
not interrupted it's something that's
going<00:04:46.699> to<00:04:46.789> be<00:04:46.940> continuous<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.900> it's<00:04:48.500> going<00:04:48.620> to

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
going to be continuous and it's going to

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.290 
going to be continuous and it's going to
be<00:04:48.770> something<00:04:48.949> I<00:04:49.220> can<00:04:49.280> screw<00:04:49.849> these<00:04:50.030> together

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
be something I can screw these together

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.070 
be something I can screw these together
and<00:04:50.900> allow<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:52.310> know<00:04:52.400> all<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.789> support<00:04:53.419> to

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
and allow you know all that support to

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.469 
and allow you know all that support to
to<00:04:54.620> go<00:04:54.770> from<00:04:54.949> the<00:04:55.099> very<00:04:55.280> top<00:04:55.520> through<00:04:55.909> bottom

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
to go from the very top through bottom

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.659 
to go from the very top through bottom
of<00:04:56.659> that<00:04:57.110> rack<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:59.030> that's<00:04:59.539> kind<00:04:59.900> of<00:04:59.960> how<00:05:00.169> the

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
of that rack so that's kind of how the

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.779 
of that rack so that's kind of how the
the<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:02.330> uprights<00:05:02.810> are<00:05:03.169> built<00:05:03.530> if<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:04.520> swing

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
the the uprights are built if we swing

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.879 
the the uprights are built if we swing
around<00:05:04.940> here<00:05:05.389> to<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.569> side<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:06.470> can<00:05:06.650> take<00:05:06.860> a

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
around here to the side we can take a

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.890 
around here to the side we can take a
look<00:05:07.099> at<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:09.440> front<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.520> back<00:05:10.729> beams<00:05:11.270> which

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
look at the front to back beams which

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.700 
look at the front to back beams which
are<00:05:12.169> not<00:05:12.530> going<00:05:13.159> to<00:05:13.400> be<00:05:13.550> load-bearing<00:05:14.710> but

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
are not going to be load-bearing but

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.580 
are not going to be load-bearing but
they<00:05:15.889> are<00:05:16.130> kind<00:05:16.490> of<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.789> line<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.590> that's

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
they are kind of in line and that's

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.409 
they are kind of in line and that's
where<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:19.009> left<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.520> right<00:05:19.610> sides<00:05:20.150> of

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
where the left and the right sides of

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.800 
where the left and the right sides of
the<00:05:20.509> tanks<00:05:20.930> will<00:05:21.400> rest<00:05:22.400> on<00:05:22.669> you'll<00:05:23.360> see<00:05:23.630> we

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
the tanks will rest on you'll see we

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.839 
the tanks will rest on you'll see we
have<00:05:23.990> kind<00:05:24.199> of<00:05:24.259> a<00:05:24.320> naked<00:05:24.560> view<00:05:25.039> here<00:05:25.430> of<00:05:25.460> just

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
have kind of a naked view here of just

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.920 
have kind of a naked view here of just
the<00:05:26.000> wood<00:05:26.320> on<00:05:27.320> this<00:05:27.710> side<00:05:28.039> and<00:05:28.449> if<00:05:29.449> we<00:05:29.630> flip

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
the wood on this side and if we flip

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.850 
the wood on this side and if we flip
around<00:05:31.060> we<00:05:32.060> can<00:05:32.270> see<00:05:32.630> what<00:05:33.289> that<00:05:33.440> looks<00:05:33.500> like

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
around we can see what that looks like

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.060 
around we can see what that looks like
with<00:05:34.520> styrofoam<00:05:35.240> sheets<00:05:35.960> laid<00:05:36.409> on<00:05:36.590> top<00:05:36.620> and

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
with styrofoam sheets laid on top and

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.450 
with styrofoam sheets laid on top and
then<00:05:37.729> as<00:05:37.880> we've<00:05:38.060> already<00:05:38.300> seen<00:05:38.710> in<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.159> front

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
then as we've already seen in the front

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.089 
then as we've already seen in the front
here<00:05:40.759> on<00:05:41.090> these<00:05:41.599> end<00:05:41.840> caps<00:05:42.229> we<00:05:42.500> can<00:05:42.680> see<00:05:42.860> what

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
here on these end caps we can see what

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.149 
here on these end caps we can see what
this<00:05:43.250> looks<00:05:43.310> like<00:05:43.580> with<00:05:43.940> tanks<00:05:44.860> installed<00:05:45.860> in

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
this looks like with tanks installed in

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.399 
this looks like with tanks installed in
them<00:05:46.370> we've<00:05:46.639> got<00:05:46.820> about<00:05:46.940> a<00:05:47.090> seven<00:05:47.840> inches<00:05:48.169> of

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
them we've got about a seven inches of

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.860 
them we've got about a seven inches of
head<00:05:48.979> height<00:05:49.219> in<00:05:49.490> between<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.419> top<00:05:50.659> of<00:05:50.780> the

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
head height in between the top of the

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.839 
head height in between the top of the
tank<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.319> the<00:05:51.409> start<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:51.889> the<00:05:51.949> next<00:05:52.130> rack<00:05:52.550> I

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
tank and the start of the next rack I

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:55.300 
tank and the start of the next rack I
would<00:05:53.389> have<00:05:53.509> liked<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:53.990> have<00:05:54.080> at<00:05:54.650> least<00:05:54.889> 12

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
would have liked to have at least 12

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.540 
would have liked to have at least 12
inches<00:05:55.550> but<00:05:56.300> that<00:05:57.289> was<00:05:57.469> wishful<00:05:57.710> thinking<00:05:58.340> and

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
inches but that was wishful thinking and

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.120 
inches but that was wishful thinking and
I<00:05:58.940> wasn't<00:05:59.210> able<00:05:59.479> to<00:05:59.840> get<00:06:00.050> any<00:06:00.319> more<00:06:00.530> than<00:06:00.710> 7

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
I wasn't able to get any more than 7

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.149 
I wasn't able to get any more than 7
inches<00:06:01.430> out<00:06:01.639> of<00:06:01.909> this<00:06:02.319> you<00:06:03.319> will<00:06:03.650> notice<00:06:03.979> that

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
inches out of this you will notice that

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.330 
inches out of this you will notice that
up<00:06:04.669> on<00:06:04.819> the<00:06:04.849> top<00:06:04.969> level<00:06:05.599> I<00:06:05.930> do<00:06:06.650> have<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.099> beams

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
up on the top level I do have the beams

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.240 
up on the top level I do have the beams
running<00:06:07.789> all<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.180> way<00:06:08.210> to<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.569> ceiling<00:06:08.750> and

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
running all the way to the ceiling and

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.770 
running all the way to the ceiling and
that's<00:06:10.250> something<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:10.789> might<00:06:11.000> cut<00:06:11.270> down<00:06:11.539> I

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
that's something that I might cut down I

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.409 
that's something that I might cut down I
might<00:06:12.080> remove<00:06:12.469> that<00:06:12.830> so<00:06:13.219> that<00:06:13.400> they<00:06:13.520> end<00:06:13.759> right

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
might remove that so that they end right

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.930 
might remove that so that they end right
at<00:06:14.449> the<00:06:14.630> top<00:06:14.810> of<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:15.199> third<00:06:15.530> level<00:06:15.949> but<00:06:16.639> I

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
at the top of that third level but I

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.230 
at the top of that third level but I
might<00:06:17.569> leave<00:06:18.050> some<00:06:18.469> of<00:06:18.620> them<00:06:18.830> full<00:06:19.729> height<00:06:19.969> all

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
might leave some of them full height all

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.580 
might leave some of them full height all
the<00:06:20.389> way<00:06:20.479> up<00:06:20.539> to<00:06:20.599> the<00:06:20.719> ceiling<00:06:20.960> so<00:06:21.349> that<00:06:21.440> they

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
the way up to the ceiling so that they

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.040 
the way up to the ceiling so that they
can<00:06:21.740> connect<00:06:22.130> to<00:06:22.280> the<00:06:22.370> ceiling<00:06:22.610> to<00:06:22.940> make<00:06:23.810> sure

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
can connect to the ceiling to make sure

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.559 
can connect to the ceiling to make sure
that<00:06:24.289> this<00:06:24.409> is<00:06:24.590> as<00:06:24.800> stable<00:06:25.610> as<00:06:25.849> possible<00:06:25.909> but

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
that this is as stable as possible but

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.350 
that this is as stable as possible but
as<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.810> can<00:06:26.930> see<00:06:27.320> just<00:06:27.560> by<00:06:28.099> looking<00:06:28.610> at<00:06:28.729> it

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
as you can see just by looking at it

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.459 
as you can see just by looking at it
this<00:06:29.449> is<00:06:29.629> very<00:06:29.930> much<00:06:30.139> going<00:06:30.319> to<00:06:30.409> be

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:30.469 
this is very much going to be

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.740 
this is very much going to be
self-supporting<00:06:31.009> and<00:06:31.550> it's<00:06:32.389> something<00:06:32.599> that

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
self-supporting and it's something that

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.080 
self-supporting and it's something that
won't<00:06:33.110> be<00:06:33.319> able<00:06:33.409> to<00:06:33.590> tip<00:06:33.770> over<00:06:33.949> because<00:06:34.729> it<00:06:34.939> is

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
won't be able to tip over because it is

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.700 
won't be able to tip over because it is
so<00:06:35.270> wide<00:06:35.919> and<00:06:36.919> so<00:06:37.909> sturdy<00:06:38.360> so<00:06:38.810> anyways<00:06:39.409> guys

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
so wide and so sturdy so anyways guys

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.309 
so wide and so sturdy so anyways guys
that's<00:06:40.039> kind<00:06:40.699> of<00:06:40.729> a<00:06:40.879> look<00:06:41.180> at<00:06:41.449> how<00:06:41.840> this<00:06:42.110> is

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
that's kind of a look at how this is

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.909 
that's kind of a look at how this is
constructed<00:06:42.650> and<00:06:43.780> you<00:06:44.780> know<00:06:44.900> kind<00:06:45.169> of<00:06:45.199> a<00:06:45.469> sense

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
constructed and you know kind of a sense

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.580 
constructed and you know kind of a sense
for<00:06:46.189> how<00:06:46.250> large<00:06:46.849> this<00:06:47.509> fish<00:06:47.840> room<00:06:48.080> build<00:06:48.379> is

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
for how large this fish room build is

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.469 
for how large this fish room build is
going<00:06:48.770> to<00:06:48.919> be<00:06:49.099> it's<00:06:49.729> going<00:06:49.819> to<00:06:50.090> be<00:06:50.210> a<00:06:50.240> lot<00:06:50.449> of

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
going to be it's going to be a lot of

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.570 
going to be it's going to be a lot of
lumber<00:06:50.810> it's<00:06:51.229> going<00:06:51.439> to<00:06:51.469> be<00:06:51.590> a<00:06:51.620> lot<00:06:51.860> of<00:06:51.889> labor

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
lumber it's going to be a lot of labor

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.730 
lumber it's going to be a lot of labor
to<00:06:52.729> put<00:06:53.090> this<00:06:53.240> together<00:06:53.449> but<00:06:54.169> I<00:06:54.199> really<00:06:54.560> do

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
to put this together but I really do

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.249 
to put this together but I really do
think<00:06:54.979> that<00:06:55.129> I've<00:06:55.400> constructed<00:06:56.270> this<00:06:56.840> in<00:06:57.080> such

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
think that I've constructed this in such

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.469 
think that I've constructed this in such
a<00:06:57.289> way<00:06:57.620> that<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:58.520> is<00:06:58.729> going<00:06:59.120> to<00:06:59.210> be<00:06:59.300> something

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
a way that it is going to be something

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.019 
a way that it is going to be something
that's<00:06:59.719> going<00:06:59.930> to<00:07:00.020> last<00:07:00.349> and<00:07:00.819> it's<00:07:01.819> something

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:02.029 
that's going to last and it's something

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.959 
that's going to last and it's something
that<00:07:02.270> I'm<00:07:02.360> really<00:07:02.389> excited<00:07:03.050> about<00:07:03.349> so<00:07:04.189> I<00:07:04.550> hope

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
went into how this fish room was laid

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.200 
went into how this fish room was laid
out<00:07:13.569> if<00:07:14.569> you<00:07:14.750> can<00:07:14.930> see<00:07:15.319> any<00:07:15.710> ways<00:07:16.639> that<00:07:17.090> I<00:07:17.150> could

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
out if you can see any ways that I could

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.749 
out if you can see any ways that I could
conserve<00:07:17.810> lumber<00:07:18.289> or<00:07:18.620> any<00:07:19.129> ways<00:07:19.370> that<00:07:19.639> I<00:07:19.699> could

make<00:07:20.060> this<00:07:20.270> a<00:07:20.330> little<00:07:20.629> bit<00:07:20.840> more<00:07:21.020> sturdy

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:21.699 
make this a little bit more sturdy

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.240 
make this a little bit more sturdy
definitely<00:07:22.699> let<00:07:22.849> me<00:07:23.000> know<00:07:23.800> you<00:07:24.800> know<00:07:24.889> always

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:26.689 
looking to save a little bit of money on

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.390 
looking to save a little bit of money on
the<00:07:26.779> build<00:07:27.020> but<00:07:27.560> I'm<00:07:27.680> not<00:07:27.740> willing<00:07:28.189> to

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
the build but I'm not willing to

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.089 
the build but I'm not willing to
sacrifice<00:07:28.639> the<00:07:29.419> structural<00:07:30.199> strength<00:07:30.740> of

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:31.099 
sacrifice the structural strength of

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:33.939 
sacrifice the structural strength of
this<00:07:31.729> racking<00:07:32.210> system<00:07:32.659> so<00:07:33.050> that's<00:07:33.650> kind<00:07:33.919> of

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:33.949 
this racking system so that's kind of

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:36.399 
this racking system so that's kind of
why<00:07:34.250> I've<00:07:34.580> decided<00:07:34.819> to<00:07:35.389> build<00:07:35.870> it<00:07:36.050> in<00:07:36.169> the<00:07:36.289> way

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:36.409 
why I've decided to build it in the way

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:39.550 
why I've decided to build it in the way
that<00:07:36.440> I<00:07:36.620> have<00:07:36.949> it's<00:07:37.279> similar<00:07:38.270> to<00:07:38.599> the<00:07:39.199> 40

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
that I have it's similar to the 40

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.439 
that I have it's similar to the 40
gallon<00:07:39.889> breeder<00:07:40.129> stands<00:07:40.610> that<00:07:40.879> I've<00:07:41.000> built<00:07:41.240> in

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:41.449 
gallon breeder stands that I've built in

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:45.040 
gallon breeder stands that I've built in
the<00:07:41.539> past<00:07:41.810> but<00:07:42.620> it<00:07:43.400> just<00:07:43.669> allows<00:07:44.029> me<00:07:44.419> the<00:07:44.659> extra

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
the past but it just allows me the extra

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.149 
the past but it just allows me the extra
room<00:07:45.529> to<00:07:45.940> stack<00:07:46.940> them<00:07:47.240> up<00:07:47.710> you'll<00:07:48.710> notice<00:07:48.979> that

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.159 
room to stack them up you'll notice that

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.070 
room to stack them up you'll notice that
you<00:07:49.520> have<00:07:49.550> plenty<00:07:49.969> of<00:07:50.150> space<00:07:50.419> to<00:07:50.449> walk<00:07:50.839> around

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
you have plenty of space to walk around

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.379 
you have plenty of space to walk around
there's<00:07:51.620> three<00:07:51.979> feet<00:07:52.279> in<00:07:52.490> between<00:07:52.639> these<00:07:53.120> two

there's three feet in between these two

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.740 
there's three feet in between these two
racks<00:07:53.810> and<00:07:54.400> there's<00:07:55.400> three<00:07:55.909> feet<00:07:56.150> or<00:07:56.360> more
