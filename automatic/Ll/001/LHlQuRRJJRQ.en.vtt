it and take a closer look I'm going to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
it and take a closer look I'm going to
probably<00:00:40.079> live<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.700> column

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059

probably live it here on the one column
pot<00:00:42.860> if<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:44.100> i'll<00:00:44.309> probably<00:00:44.610> pass<00:00:45.090> rate<00:00:45.450> ow

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pot if not i'll probably pass rate ow

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.190 
pot if not i'll probably pass rate ow
I'll<00:00:46.140> see<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.520> want<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> trunk<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.840> thicken

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I'll see I want the trunk to get thicken

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.299 
I'll see I want the trunk to get thicken
so<00:00:49.469> i'll<00:00:49.829> probably<00:00:50.039> leave<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.739> take

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so i'll probably leave it here and take

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.849 
so i'll probably leave it here and take
a<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:54.860> it's<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.219> style<00:00:56.550> i<00:00:57.500> chose<00:00:58.500> to
