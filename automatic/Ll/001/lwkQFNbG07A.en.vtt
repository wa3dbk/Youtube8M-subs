00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
going to see today is I have already

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500 
going to see today is I have already
done<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.250> demonstration<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.030> few<00:00:09.240> times

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
done this demonstration a few times

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.390 
done this demonstration a few times
you'll<00:00:09.809> get<00:00:09.990> I'm<00:00:10.230> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.650> rinse<00:00:10.800> out<00:00:11.040> this

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
you'll get I'm going to rinse out this

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.839 
you'll get I'm going to rinse out this
beaker<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:14.099> confident<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
beaker so that we are confident that

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.310 
beaker so that we are confident that
there<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.540> no<00:00:17.029> ion<00:00:18.029> making<00:00:18.570> stuff<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.109> there

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
there is no ion making stuff in there

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.460 
there is no ion making stuff in there
but<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.789> go<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.480> some

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
but they can we're going to go for some

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.689 
but they can we're going to go for some
aqua<00:00:22.949> pura<00:00:23.689> now<00:00:24.689> does<00:00:25.260> aqua<00:00:25.650> pura<00:00:25.949> conduct

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
aqua pura now does aqua pura conduct

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.850 
aqua pura now does aqua pura conduct
electricity<00:00:33.410> huh

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
electricity huh

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.670 
electricity huh
gosh<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.149> thing<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:37.410> see

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
gosh can we have this thing on let's see

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
gosh can we have this thing on let's see
oh<00:00:37.829> yeah<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.820> baby

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
oh yeah it's on baby

yeah like that sparks good okay so with

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.090 
yeah like that sparks good okay so with
aqua<00:00:55.739> pura<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.850> no<00:00:57.149> problem<00:00:58.109> now

no you're gonna die yeah I want you to
be<00:01:04.559> over<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:15.770> no<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:19.520> you'll<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.700> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
be over here no don't you'll get a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.700 
be over here no don't you'll get a
better<00:01:20.970> video<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.810> doing<00:01:22.320> video<00:01:22.500> she

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
better video if you're doing video she

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.990 
better video if you're doing video she
can<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.070> better<00:01:23.310> without<00:01:23.549> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
can do better without it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.700 
can do better without it
okay<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.700> -<00:01:27.560> yes<00:01:30.710> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
okay now here we go it's up is - yes the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.710 
okay now here we go it's up is - yes the
beaker<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:32.700> we're<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.329> pour<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> little

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
beaker and now we're gonna pour a little

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
beaker and now we're gonna pour a little
salt<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.340> what's<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.490> prediction<00:01:50.000> okay

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
salt in what's your prediction okay

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.109 
salt in what's your prediction okay
she's<00:01:51.600> she's<00:01:52.110> been<00:01:52.290> holding<00:01:52.710> faithfully<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
she's she's been holding faithfully and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.569 
she's she's been holding faithfully and
oh<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:55.350> gosh<00:01:55.560> why<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.100> keep<00:01:56.310> getting

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
oh my gosh why just keep getting

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.240 
oh my gosh why just keep getting
brighter<00:01:56.850> because<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.049> salt<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.189> moving

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
brighter because the salt is moving

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:13.050 
brighter because the salt is moving
so<00:02:01.240> he's<00:02:01.480> moving<00:02:01.720> around<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.470> always<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:12.060> did

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
so he's moving around is always just did

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.300 
so he's moving around is always just did
we<00:02:13.120> get<00:02:13.270> your<00:02:13.420> chemist<00:02:13.900> yeah<00:02:14.200> oh<00:02:15.120> yes<00:02:20.070> now<00:02:21.070> what

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
we get your chemist yeah oh yes now what

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.500 
we get your chemist yeah oh yes now what
we<00:02:21.520> have<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:22.300> good<00:02:22.870> conduction<00:02:24.240> be<00:02:25.240> quiet

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
we have is good conduction be quiet

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.340 
we have is good conduction be quiet
everybody<00:02:26.310> thank<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.330> what<00:02:31.990> we<00:02:32.110> have<00:02:32.320> now

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
everybody thank you so what we have now

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.920 
everybody thank you so what we have now
is<00:02:32.710> ions<00:02:33.070> in<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.400> water<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.030> because<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
is ions in the water and because of the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.250 
is ions in the water and because of the
ions<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.800> have<00:02:36.040> conduction<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.210> that's<00:02:37.960> what

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
ions we have conduction and that's what

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.930 
ions we have conduction and that's what
that<00:02:38.440> light<00:02:38.680> bulb<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.100> telling<00:02:39.460> us<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.640> there

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
that light bulb is telling us that there

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.760 
that light bulb is telling us that there
are<00:02:40.000> ions<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> water<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
are ions in the water but the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:57.050 
are ions in the water but the
electricity<00:02:42.250> can't<00:02:43.120> move<00:02:43.420> through<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.320> water

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.280 

this<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.330> aqua<00:02:58.960> it<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.380> not<00:02:59.800> pure<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:01.290> that's

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
this is aqua it is not pure up that's

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.190 
this is aqua it is not pure up that's
water<00:03:02.620> from<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.130> tap<00:03:03.370> yes<00:03:03.700> not<00:03:04.510> you're<00:03:04.959> not

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
water from the tap yes not you're not

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.960 
water from the tap yes not you're not
this<00:03:05.470> however<00:03:05.680> watch<00:03:06.520> a<00:03:08.100> little<00:03:09.100> bit<00:03:09.340> because

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
this however watch a little bit because

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.300 
this however watch a little bit because
their<00:03:10.120> salts<00:03:10.480> in<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.630> body<00:03:10.930> there<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.739> salt<00:03:12.040> in

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
their salts in the body there is salt in

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.590 
their salts in the body there is salt in
the<00:03:12.400> water<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.450> most<00:03:13.660> common<00:03:14.170> salt<00:03:14.530> is

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the water and the most common salt is

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.010 
the water and the most common salt is
the<00:03:16.600> most<00:03:16.840> common<00:03:17.350> salt<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.860> get<00:03:18.310> is

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
the most common salt that you get is

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.650 
the most common salt that you get is
else<00:03:20.020> iam<00:03:20.670> okay<00:03:21.670> calcium<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.450> water

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
else iam okay calcium in the water

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.680 
else iam okay calcium in the water
that's<00:03:23.170> what<00:03:23.380> makes<00:03:23.680> your<00:03:23.830> clothes<00:03:24.100> stiff

what<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:54.810> have<00:04:55.080> right<00:04:55.349> now<00:04:55.410> because<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:56.849> can't

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
what we have right now because we can't

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.930 
what we have right now because we can't
see<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.870> know<00:04:58.260> that<00:05:02.360> too<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.810> water<00:05:04.080> as

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
see it I know that too the water as

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.820 
see it I know that too the water as
individual<00:05:05.940> molecules<00:05:06.830> individual

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
individual molecules individual

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.490 
individual molecules individual
molecules<00:05:08.490> are<00:05:08.760> in<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.090> mental<00:05:09.539> world<00:05:09.810> you

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
molecules are in the mental world you

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.589 
molecules are in the mental world you
can't<00:05:10.860> see<00:05:11.220> something<00:05:11.580> that<00:05:11.940> small<00:05:12.240> that's

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
can't see something that small that's

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.779 
can't see something that small that's
why<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.930> looks<00:05:13.320> like<00:05:13.409> water<00:05:13.889> with<00:05:14.250> nothing<00:05:14.460> in

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
why it looks like water with nothing in

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.129 
why it looks like water with nothing in
it<00:05:15.020> now<00:05:16.760> because<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:17.789> saw<00:05:18.210> me<00:05:18.240> put<00:05:18.449> sugar<00:05:18.930> in

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
it now because you saw me put sugar in

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:33.250 
it now because you saw me put sugar in
here<00:05:19.320> what's<00:05:19.530> your<00:05:19.710> expectation<00:05:31.580> anyway

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
here what's your expectation anyway

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.250 
here what's your expectation anyway
sugar<00:05:34.260> does<00:05:34.650> not<00:05:34.919> break<00:05:35.220> up<00:05:35.840> sugar<00:05:36.840> does<00:05:37.080> not

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
sugar does not break up sugar does not

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.210 
sugar does not break up sugar does not
form<00:05:37.590> ions<00:05:40.580> together<00:05:42.139> it's<00:05:43.139> not<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.380> compound

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
form ions together it's not a compound

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.850 
form ions together it's not a compound
it's<00:05:44.789> what<00:05:45.030> we<00:05:45.180> call<00:05:45.419> a<00:05:45.720> John<00:05:46.260> well<00:05:46.650> if<00:05:46.740> you

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
it's what we call a John well if you

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.589 
it's what we call a John well if you
write<00:05:47.070> this<00:05:47.280> down<00:05:47.490> this<00:05:47.849> is<00:05:48.030> an<00:05:48.150> important

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
write this down this is an important

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.999 
write this down this is an important
word<00:05:48.750> this<00:05:49.620> is<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:50.039> zon<00:05:50.870> electrolyte<00:05:52.009> which

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
word this is a zon electrolyte which

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.650 
word this is a zon electrolyte which
also

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
also

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.160

Chris you are right on not only is it

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.220 
Chris you are right on not only is it
not<00:05:58.500> electrolyte<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.700> is<00:06:00.000> not<00:06:00.360> ion<00:06:01.140> for<00:06:01.620> me<00:06:02.000> yes

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
not electrolyte it is not ion for me yes

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.950 
not electrolyte it is not ion for me yes
that<00:06:04.230> was<00:06:04.470> very<00:06:04.590> good
