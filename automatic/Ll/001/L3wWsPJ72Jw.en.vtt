this<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.620> home<00:02:19.310> screen<00:02:19.430> as<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.760> mentioned

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
this is the home screen as I mentioned

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.160 
this is the home screen as I mentioned
earlier<00:02:20.300> let<00:02:20.420> me<00:02:20.540> go<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> camera

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
earlier let me go to the camera

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.380 
earlier let me go to the camera
application<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.860> check<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.459> camera

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
application and check out the camera

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.030 
application and check out the camera
quality<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:26.319> let's<00:02:27.319> try<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.560> capture<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
quality so let's try to capture the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280 
quality so let's try to capture the
picture<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:29.300> for<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.599> first<00:02:29.870> let<00:02:30.020> us<00:02:30.140> just

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
picture but for that first let us just

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.339 
picture but for that first let us just
check<00:02:30.470> out<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:31.030> current<00:02:32.030> settings<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.810> check

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
check out the current settings and check

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.260 
check out the current settings and check
what's<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.830> current<00:02:33.950> quality<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:37.270> focus

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
what's the current quality so focus

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.089 
what's the current quality so focus
should<00:02:38.420> be<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.599> auto<00:02:38.870> exposure<00:02:39.620> value<00:02:40.040> should

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
should be on auto exposure value should

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.620 
should be on auto exposure value should
be<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.490> default<00:02:41.110> as<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:42.410> see<00:02:42.590> here<00:02:43.630> five

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
be on default as you can see here five

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.420

megapixel is the resolution which is set
up<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.700> was<00:02:46.910> down<00:02:47.209> though<00:02:47.420> thinner<00:02:47.980> okay

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
up it was down though thinner okay

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.280 
up it was down though thinner okay
picture<00:02:49.970> quality<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.480> super<00:02:50.840> fine

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.570 

rightness<00:02:55.290> let<00:02:55.500> me<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.860> go<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.190> maximum

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
rightness let me just go to the maximum

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.850 
rightness let me just go to the maximum
brightness<00:02:56.700> but<00:02:57.240> that's<00:02:57.450> very<00:02:57.840> high<00:02:58.050> let's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
brightness but that's very high let's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.610 
brightness but that's very high let's
keep<00:02:59.070> with<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.520> default<00:02:59.940> brightness<00:03:00.620> there

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
keep with the default brightness there

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.950 
keep with the default brightness there
are<00:03:01.680> different<00:03:02.030> capture<00:03:03.030> modes<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:03.750> made

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
are different capture modes but made

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.510 
are different capture modes but made
also<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> continuous<00:03:04.740> short<00:03:05.010> mode<00:03:05.220> which<00:03:05.400> is

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
also a continuous short mode which is

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.850 
also a continuous short mode which is
quite<00:03:05.910> surprising<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:07.320> normally<00:03:07.740> this

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
quite surprising because normally this

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.410 
quite surprising because normally this
budget<00:03:08.400> phone<00:03:08.700> don't<00:03:08.820> get<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.180> kind<00:03:09.330> of

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
budget phone don't get this kind of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.030 
budget phone don't get this kind of
features<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.320> surprising<00:03:10.770> we<00:03:10.860> got<00:03:11.010> a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
features but this is surprising we got a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
features but this is surprising we got a
continuous<00:03:11.490> up<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.820> seven<00:03:12.630> shot<00:03:12.810> mode<00:03:13.620> that's

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
continuous up to seven shot mode that's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.010 
continuous up to seven shot mode that's
the<00:03:14.040> burst<00:03:14.880> mode<00:03:15.120> with<00:03:15.330> seven<00:03:15.840> pictures

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
the burst mode with seven pictures

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.590 
the burst mode with seven pictures
captured<00:03:16.620> let<00:03:17.160> me<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.400> capture<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> single

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
captured let me just capture a single

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.510 
captured let me just capture a single
photo<00:03:18.840> first<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.320> then<00:03:19.470> try<00:03:19.680> out<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.100> burst

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
photo first and then try out the burst

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.400 
photo first and then try out the burst
shot<00:03:20.550> mode<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:24.410> picture

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
shot mode so this is the picture

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.040 
shot mode so this is the picture
captured<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:28.820> okay<00:03:29.820> since<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:30.840> selected

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
captured on okay since I have selected

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.530 
captured on okay since I have selected
the<00:03:31.440> seven<00:03:31.950> capture<00:03:32.340> mode<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:33.030> would<00:03:33.180> actually

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
the seven capture mode it would actually

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.080 
the seven capture mode it would actually
end<00:03:33.870> up<00:03:34.200> capturing<00:03:34.470> seven<00:03:35.070> shots<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.490> then

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
end up capturing seven shots and then

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.300 
end up capturing seven shots and then
stop<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.230> that's<00:03:37.380> quite<00:03:37.620> surprising<00:03:37.830> because

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
stop so that's quite surprising because

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.670 
stop so that's quite surprising because
on<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.700> normal<00:03:39.150> other<00:03:39.270> smartphones<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.440> have

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
on the normal other smartphones we have

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.250 
on the normal other smartphones we have
actually<00:03:41.570> continuously<00:03:42.570> long<00:03:42.840> press<00:03:43.080> on<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
actually continuously long press on the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.160 
actually continuously long press on the
shutter<00:03:43.590> button<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:44.100> order<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:45.170> experience

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
shutter button in order to experience

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.320 
shutter button in order to experience
him<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.770> this<00:03:47.400> clearly<00:03:47.580> shows<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.090> the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
him and this clearly shows that the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.590 
him and this clearly shows that the
camera<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.980> up<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.400> markets<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.390> bush

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
camera is not up to the markets the bush

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.360 
camera is not up to the markets the bush
camera<00:03:51.960> have<00:03:52.230> ever<00:03:52.410> seen<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.950> worst<00:03:53.100> 5

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
camera have ever seen the worst 5

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
megapixel camera I have ever seen

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.170 
megapixel camera I have ever seen
it<00:03:55.080> looks<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> 1.3<00:03:56.130> megapixel<00:03:56.370> cameras

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
it looks like a 1.3 megapixel cameras

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.550 
it looks like a 1.3 megapixel cameras
capture<00:03:57.810> has<00:03:57.960> been<00:03:58.110> C<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.800> are<00:03:58.890> lines<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.460> I

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
capture has been C there are lines and I

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.410 
capture has been C there are lines and I
cannot<00:04:01.560> even<00:04:01.770> understand<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.370> what<00:04:02.760> kind<00:04:03.270> of

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
cannot even understand that what kind of

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.780 
cannot even understand that what kind of
object<00:04:03.870> was<00:04:04.020> in<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.590> background<00:04:05.040> even<00:04:05.730> though

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
object was in the background even though

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.720 
object was in the background even though
it<00:04:05.850> was<00:04:06.000> clearly<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.480> knife<00:04:06.750> here<00:04:07.050> so<00:04:07.770> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
it was clearly a knife here so the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.510 
it was clearly a knife here so the
camera<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.150> something<00:04:09.720> which<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.380> not<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.400> to

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
camera is something which is not up to
