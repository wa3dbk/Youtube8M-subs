putting<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.030> chiller<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.520> put<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
putting it in the chiller if you put the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.730 
putting it in the chiller if you put the
glass<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.090> wet<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.020> chiller<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.440> turned

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.250 
glass in wet and the chiller is turned
down<00:02:35.980> low<00:02:36.010> enough<00:02:36.640> you're<00:02:37.150> actually<00:02:37.690> freezing

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
down low enough you're actually freezing

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.830 
down low enough you're actually freezing
the<00:02:38.350> glass<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.640> very<00:02:40.000> difficult<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.540> pour<00:02:40.810> a

draught beer into a frozen glass the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.910 
draught beer into a frozen glass the
temperature<00:02:43.870> difference<00:02:44.230> between<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.590> beer

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
temperature difference between the beer

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.950 
temperature difference between the beer
and<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.220> glass<00:02:45.460> causes<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.330> beer<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.690> foam

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
and the glass causes the beer to foam

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.370 
and the glass causes the beer to foam
when<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.380> hits<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.770> frozen<00:02:48.130> glass
