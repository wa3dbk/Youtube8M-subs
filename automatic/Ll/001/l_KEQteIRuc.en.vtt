are the what the pepper does is first
irritate<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> skin<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.800> blood<00:00:41.040> begins

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
irritate the skin and the blood begins

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
irritate the skin and the blood begins
to<00:00:41.520> rush<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.210> area<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> does<00:00:43.170> increase

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to rush to that area so it does increase

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
to rush to that area so it does increase
circulation<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> also<00:00:45.090> create

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
circulation but you also create

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.069 
circulation but you also create
first-degree<00:00:46.500> skin<00:00:46.950> damage<00:00:47.420> not<00:00:48.420> necessarily

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
first-degree skin damage not necessarily

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.709 
first-degree skin damage not necessarily
burn<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.219> borderline<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.570> its

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
burn so it's borderline of that but its

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.380 
burn so it's borderline of that but its
first<00:00:52.050> degree<00:00:52.379> spin<00:00:52.800> damage<00:00:53.520> which<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> very

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
first degree spin damage which is very

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
first degree spin damage which is very
similar<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.960> first-degree<00:00:55.559> burns<00:00:56.010> your

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
similar to first-degree burns your

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.720 
similar to first-degree burns your
epidermis<00:00:57.059> becomes<00:00:57.629> worn<00:00:58.520> irritated<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.640> if

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
epidermis becomes worn irritated and if

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
epidermis becomes worn irritated and if
you're<00:00:59.820> not<00:00:59.940> careful<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:01.170> may<00:01:01.199> cost<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you're not careful you may cost of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
you're not careful you may cost of
inflammation<00:01:02.270> because<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> may<00:01:03.539> hit<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
inflammation because it may hit that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
inflammation because it may hit that
dermis<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.979> now<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
dermis so now that is not what you

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.149 
dermis so now that is not what you
should<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.200> decrease<00:01:07.950> circulation<00:01:08.670> um<00:01:10.159> it's

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
should do decrease circulation um it's

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.100 
should do decrease circulation um it's
just<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:11.729> thing<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:13.049> to

just not a good thing you want to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.530 
just not a good thing you want to
increase<00:01:13.350> circulation<00:01:13.650> by<00:01:14.130> d<00:01:14.189> t<00:01:14.729> shirts<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.299> G

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
increase circulation by d t shirts on G

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.539 
increase circulation by d t shirts on G
that's<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.290> best<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> get<00:01:17.100> increase<00:01:17.400> your

pressing against the scalp and what I
call<00:01:22.259> rotating<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> skin<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
call rotating the skin that would be

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.440

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
and the diameter of the strain becomes

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.900 
and the diameter of the strain becomes
smaller<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.080> causes<00:02:17.980> thinning<00:02:18.190> then

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
smaller so that causes thinning then

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
little more research on that because I

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.980 
little more research on that because I
haven't<00:05:47.860> really<00:05:48.040> used<00:05:48.430> that<00:05:48.850> so<00:05:49.540> i'll<00:05:49.630> do<00:05:49.840> that

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
haven't really used that so i'll do that

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.610 
haven't really used that so i'll do that
now<00:05:50.200> maybe<00:05:50.440> I<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.860> may<00:05:51.310> have<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.790> another<00:05:52.620> answer

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
now maybe I I may have a another answer

all right first you have different types

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.240 
all right first you have different types
of<00:06:12.250> breakage<00:06:12.840> you<00:06:13.840> can<00:06:14.080> have<00:06:14.350> clear<00:06:14.950> breaks
