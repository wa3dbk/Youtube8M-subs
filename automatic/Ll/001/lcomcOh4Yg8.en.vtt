I<00:00:02.060> made<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> rash<00:00:03.360> decisions

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.640 

okay<00:00:30.269> today<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.929> adidas<00:00:31.349> adipower

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650

predator<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:32.460> black<00:00:32.940> white<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.180> red<00:00:33.410> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
predator in black white and red the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.020 
predator in black white and red the
first<00:00:34.649> thing<00:00:34.829> you'll<00:00:34.949> notice<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.430> these<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
first thing you'll notice on these is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
first thing you'll notice on these is
different<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> pro<00:00:36.960> 2<00:00:37.020> X<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.530> that

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
different from the pro 2 X is that

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.360 
different from the pro 2 X is that
they're<00:00:38.340> much<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:39.269> lightweight<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
they're much more lightweight the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.790 
they're much more lightweight the
projectors<00:00:42.030> were<00:00:42.180> pretty<00:00:42.420> heavy<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
projectors were pretty heavy and this is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.979 
projectors were pretty heavy and this is
because<00:00:43.949> of<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.460> sprint<00:00:45.000> frame<00:00:45.300> technology

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
because of the sprint frame technology

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
because of the sprint frame technology
which<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.680> used<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> id0<00:00:47.699> 50s<00:00:48.649> also<00:00:49.649> down

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
which is used on the id0 50s also down

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
which is used on the id0 50s also down
here<00:00:50.550> around<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> toe<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.050> soft

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
here around the toe it's a very soft

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.479 
here around the toe it's a very soft
leather<00:00:52.970> for<00:00:53.970> good<00:00:54.149> touch<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> ball<00:00:54.780> um<00:00:55.489> as

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
leather for good touch on the ball um as

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.139 
leather for good touch on the ball um as
you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:59.149> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you can see right here there's the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.170 
you can see right here there's the
predator<00:01:00.540> technology<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:02.460> very<00:01:02.670> grippy

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
predator technology to very grippy

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.550 
predator technology to very grippy
rubber<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:04.530> has<00:01:05.100> different<00:01:05.970> bumps<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:07.320> add

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
rubber and has different bumps to add

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
rubber and has different bumps to add
more<00:01:07.799> curve<00:01:08.220> um<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.520> yet<00:01:11.520> another<00:01:11.549> difference

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
more curve um and yet another difference

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.560 
more curve um and yet another difference
is<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.680> dirt<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> separate<00:01:14.579> tongue<00:01:14.850> which

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
is the dirt is to separate tongue which

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.770 
is the dirt is to separate tongue which
they<00:01:15.689> didn't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.680> addy<00:01:17.509> power<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
they didn't have on the addy power I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.190 
they didn't have on the addy power I
adidas<00:01:19.560> Predator<00:01:20.040> X's<00:01:20.720> which<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> big

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
adidas Predator X's which was a big

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100 
adidas Predator X's which was a big
issue<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.650> lot<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> people<00:01:23.540> also<00:01:24.540> down<00:01:25.079> here

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
issue for a lot of people also down here

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.210 
issue for a lot of people also down here
on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.950> 4th<00:01:26.310> 5th<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> power<00:01:27.090> spine<00:01:27.479> uh

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
on the 4th 5th is the power spine uh

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
shooting with new adidas adipower Peru

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.470 
shooting with new adidas adipower Peru
um<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.520> they<00:02:13.120> did<00:02:13.300> form<00:02:13.690> very<00:02:13.900> well<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.350> me<00:02:14.500> I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
um and they did form very well for me I

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.750 
um and they did form very well for me I
noticed<00:02:16.480> how<00:02:16.750> light<00:02:16.959> they<00:02:17.080> were<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:18.700> were

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
noticed how light they were they were

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.809 
noticed how light they were they were
very<00:02:18.940> late<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.420> that's<00:02:19.780> weird<00:02:20.260> for<00:02:20.819> predators

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
very late and that's weird for predators

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.030 
very late and that's weird for predators
because<00:02:22.150> they're<00:02:22.300> usually<00:02:22.450> very<00:02:22.890> heavy<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
because they're usually very heavy and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.010 
because they're usually very heavy and
bulky<00:02:24.370> but<00:02:25.239> definitely<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.050> one<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:28.020> was

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
bulky but definitely not this one I was

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.750 
bulky but definitely not this one I was
just<00:02:29.200> shooting<00:02:29.350> around<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.980> dribbling<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
just shooting around and dribbling and I

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.729 
just shooting around and dribbling and I
could<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:31.030> noticed<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:32.440> wasn't

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
could just noticed that it really wasn't

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.229 
could just noticed that it really wasn't
weighing<00:02:32.890> down<00:02:33.070> my<00:02:33.130> foot<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.820> really<00:02:33.970> wasn't

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
weighing down my foot it really wasn't

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.979 
weighing down my foot it really wasn't
like<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.750> was<00:02:34.870> wearing<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.230> big<00:02:35.440> bulky<00:02:36.870> she<00:02:37.870> all

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
like I was wearing a big bulky she all

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.910 
like I was wearing a big bulky she all
my<00:02:38.110> food<00:02:38.430> also<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:40.510> power<00:02:40.750> spine<00:02:41.110> did<00:02:41.560> make<00:02:41.800> an

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
my food also the power spine did make an

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.640 
my food also the power spine did make an
effect<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.519> was<00:02:42.880> shooting<00:02:43.060> much<00:02:43.360> harder<00:02:43.750> than

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
effect I was shooting much harder than

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.340 
effect I was shooting much harder than
usual<00:02:44.950> um<00:02:46.470> because<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.280> guess<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.350> energy

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
usual um because of I guess the energy

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.559 
usual um because of I guess the energy
loss<00:02:50.530> being<00:02:51.340> minimized<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.370> pretty<00:02:54.700> awesome

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
loss being minimized so pretty awesome

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.479 
loss being minimized so pretty awesome
it's<00:02:55.959> pretty<00:02:56.170> surprised<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:57.100> pleasantly

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489
