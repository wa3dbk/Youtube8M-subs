00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
like that which isn't too much now when

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.040 
like that which isn't too much now when
I<00:02:42.400> looked<00:02:42.640> at<00:02:42.730> her<00:02:42.880> actually<00:02:43.270> because<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.900> saw

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
I looked at her actually because I saw

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.930 
I looked at her actually because I saw
the<00:02:44.110> movie<00:02:44.230> recently<00:02:45.070> I'm<00:02:45.220> trying<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> having

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
the movie recently I'm trying to having

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.830 
the movie recently I'm trying to having
second<00:02:46.240> thoughts<00:02:46.270> about<00:02:46.540> his<00:02:46.720> size<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:48.100> I
