00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
flying into the sea a little bit so you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.920 
flying into the sea a little bit so you
can<00:03:02.700> try<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.090> find<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:03.390> render<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
can try and find this render in the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.600 
can try and find this render in the
distance<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:04.800> once<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.070> do<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.340> onto<00:03:05.520> this

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
