00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.500

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:27.540
 [Music] 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.619
 good guys and girls we are here in 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.900
 a new tutorial that has been uploaded to the channel 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.809
 that it's about how to do our 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.329
 own minecraft animation with 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.339
 your 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.350
 with your 15 well this is titles of 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.899
 the night I go to that many people want 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.460
 make your own creations of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:55.070
 Minecraft animation I expect simple 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.799
 but he does not know how to use programs 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.079
 as they are photoshop that are pretty 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.280
 divide from what to learn how to 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.220
 use it since it 's a pretty 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.200
 complicated 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.810
 you have to do less your tutorials in 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.980
 youtube and it 's quite difficult is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.650
 quite difficult 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:16.570
 to those animations it takes time 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.390
 and therefore he said in the tutorial 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.950
 in which I will give you a page where 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.690
 you can do your presse 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.390
 simple animations and they are 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.790
 predetermined then you 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.720
 the only thing you do is good let's go 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.490
 step by step 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:38.009
 at the beginning the page we are not going to google 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.009
 the page is called new skin 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.420
 here the Germans give a wallpaper 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.010
 and here it takes us to this part and here 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 mainly because we can do 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.330
 our own simple animations 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.850
 the style is already predetermined 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.800
 is defined but the only thing we can 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.229
 change is for example put our 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.430
 minecraft skin that is for example 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.120
 let's do it with an example with 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.470
 any of these 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.470
 we will give you is for example 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.220
 it takes us here here has us 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.709
 selected this character then 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.200
 us what we would do we can put 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.970
 any skin of this put those of the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.379
 others want no but if for example 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.610
 that we have ours what we would do 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.610
 would be for example 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.610
 our minecraft nick we have here to 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.220
 player and it would already load our corner 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.870
 so with any type of skin with and 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.490
 could you your name 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.880
 any and you download here your 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.050
 your corner then after having here to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.050
 your skin everything already 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.480
 so let's go down here what I chose that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 is the size the size of what 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.210
 you of this animation so it is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.300
 180 720 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.240
 Well I prefer less than 320 x 1080 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.880
 Well this is already looking for what 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.400
 we would choose would be the click 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.130
 left to which we want for example I 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.130
 I'm going to choose the 1920 x 1080 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.000
 Left click and disappears and we 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:23.830
 the animation made here will appear 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.590
 here we choose the format png jpg 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:32.140
 at the end and choose the format jpg 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.400
 We give don lauro and if not 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.400
 download here 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.940
 and then we are already here and it would be 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.910
 that is, it is animation and so we can 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.980
 do many animations because 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:56.790
 example see with another 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:00.340
 another style for example is football 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.010
 in the soccer field the same thing is done 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.430
 here the only thing that there are more characters by 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.760
 example be here and for example you're going to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.760
 put him 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.070
 then let's go here we put this is that what 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.320
 we make this the west and so we must go 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.320
 one by one filling them 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.460
 or this is that is in this corner 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.569
 is not any you're good 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.569
 the goalkeeper 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.630
 this would be our completed animation 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.630
 OK 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.670
 after having gone step by step 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.950
 selecting the same thing we would do again 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.950
 we choose the size 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.900
 then choose the shape the size 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:05.950
 we choose the jpg png format and we give 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:09.310
 download another would be this 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.440
 and it would be like that 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.180
 That animation would be the truth 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.950
 that assignments are pretty good 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.320
 what we have here is worth 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.940
 the good thing is that they are already here 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.720
 we do not need other programs like 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:29.810
 photoshop etc are simpler it's worth not 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.420
 there is no one can be great although there 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.280
 enough are more are simple but the 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.610
 The truth is that the 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.610
 most 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.479
