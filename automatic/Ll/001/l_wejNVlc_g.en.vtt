00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
well then break it just seems to be a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.480 
well then break it just seems to be a
rusty<00:00:18.300> inside<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.250> would<00:00:20.400> be

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
rusty inside the one I would be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.279 
rusty inside the one I would be
replacing<00:00:21.470> this<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> 5<00:00:23.850> liter<00:00:24.289> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
replacing this one was a 5 liter and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.410 
replacing this one was a 5 liter and
this<00:00:25.800> new<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.099> now<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.539> 4<00:00:27.539> litres<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:29.240> we<00:00:30.240> just

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this new one now is 4 litres and we just

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.440 
this new one now is 4 litres and we just
went<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.630> same<00:00:30.869> name<00:00:31.640> not<00:00:32.640> sure<00:00:32.850> why<00:00:33.059> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
went with same name not sure why it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
went with same name not sure why it's
figured<00:00:33.870> might<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.050> well<00:00:34.140> keep<00:00:34.260> didn't<00:00:34.530> brand

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
figured might as well keep didn't brand

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.670 
figured might as well keep didn't brand
name<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> same<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.960> got<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.380> from

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
name the same and I got this one from

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.430 
name the same and I got this one from
amazon.com<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:39.950> 120<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.280> odd<00:00:41.370> dollars<00:00:42.440> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
amazon.com for 120 some odd dollars it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.540 
amazon.com for 120 some odd dollars it
so<00:00:44.870> supposedly<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.829> well-known

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so supposedly this is it's a well-known

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.529 
so supposedly this is it's a well-known
Japanese<00:00:48.180> brand<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.670> what<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
Japanese brand and what I got here is a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.740 
Japanese brand and what I got here is a
lot<00:00:51.690> less<00:00:51.899> fancy<00:00:52.199> than<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> that's

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
lot less fancy than the one that that's

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.650 
lot less fancy than the one that that's
rusting<00:00:55.399> because<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.789> does<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
rusting because this one does not have a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.090 
rusting because this one does not have a
panoramic<00:00:58.559> window<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.250> panorama<00:01:00.000> window<00:01:01.100> but

I'm going to unbox this and let's put

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.640 
I'm going to unbox this and let's put
them<00:01:32.360> side-by-side<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:33.020> see<00:01:33.290> how<00:01:33.440> they<00:01:33.560> match

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
them side-by-side I see how they match

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.810 
them side-by-side I see how they match
up<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.130> here's<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.760> unit<00:01:35.000> out<00:01:35.150> of<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.270> box

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
up so here's the unit out of the box

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.890 
up so here's the unit out of the box
right<00:01:37.820> off<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.060> bat<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.330> can<00:01:38.360> tell<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.780> with

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
right off the bat you can tell that with

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.340 
right off the bat you can tell that with
four<00:01:39.110> liters<00:01:39.409> it's<00:01:39.950> thinner<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:41.229> little<00:01:42.229> bit

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
four liters it's thinner a little bit

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.490 
four liters it's thinner a little bit

attention were where this I can't tell
where<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.810> looks<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:18.019> rust<00:02:18.910> which

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
where this it looks like rust which

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.640 
where this it looks like rust which
would<00:02:20.090> be<00:02:20.150> weird<00:02:20.360> because<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.930> parts<00:02:21.290> almost

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
would be weird because this parts almost

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.440 
would be weird because this parts almost
like<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:24.290> some<00:02:25.070> sort<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.310> hard<00:02:25.640> plastic<00:02:25.850> or

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.500 
like like some sort of hard plastic or
something<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:28.100> I'm<00:02:28.310> not<00:02:28.430> sure<00:02:28.489> why<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.150> color

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
something so I'm not sure why that color

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.650 
something so I'm not sure why that color

it<00:03:26.120> still<00:03:26.390> rotates<00:03:26.780> easily<00:03:27.170> because<00:03:27.859> there's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
it still rotates easily because there's

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.199 
it still rotates easily because there's
a<00:03:28.070> swivel<00:03:28.549> piece<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.329> bottom<00:03:29.450> here

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:41.110 

and<00:03:33.400> as<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:34.879> this<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:38.599> power<00:03:38.810> captor<00:03:40.120> is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
and as for this the power captor is

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.149 
and as for this the power captor is
magnetic<00:03:41.689> so<00:03:47.200> something<00:03:48.200> happens<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:49.069> would

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
magnetic so something happens it would

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.619 
magnetic so something happens it would

just automatically disconnect kind of

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.440 
just automatically disconnect kind of

this<00:05:16.100> hot<00:05:16.370> water<00:05:16.640> dispenser<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:17.450> think<00:05:18.110> is<00:05:18.170> very

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
this hot water dispenser I think is very

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.860 
this hot water dispenser I think is very
convenient<00:05:18.830> because<00:05:19.730> we're<00:05:20.330> always<00:05:20.540> going<00:05:20.780> to

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
convenient because we're always going to

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.230 
convenient because we're always going to
have<00:05:21.020> hot<00:05:21.260> water<00:05:21.470> for<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:22.480> baby<00:05:23.480> formulas<00:05:25.240> so

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
have hot water for the baby formulas so

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:49.920 
have hot water for the baby formulas so
let's<00:05:26.510> see<00:05:26.660> how<00:05:41.590> it's<00:05:42.590> very<00:05:42.830> easy<00:05:43.750> simple

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:06:02.770 

that's<00:05:50.930> what's<00:05:51.140> slow<00:05:51.380> is<00:05:55.570> just<00:05:56.570> slower<00:06:01.750> what<00:06:02.750> I

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
that's what's slow is just slower what I

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.150 
that's what's slow is just slower what I
notice<00:06:03.080> that<00:06:03.320> this<00:06:03.590> does<00:06:03.650> it<00:06:03.950> have<00:06:04.130> a

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
notice that this does it have a

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.440 
notice that this does it have a
dechlorinate<00:06:05.150> but<00:06:06.080> not<00:06:06.290> here<00:06:06.560> so<00:06:07.330> with<00:06:08.330> the
