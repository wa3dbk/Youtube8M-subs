something<00:00:10.559> i<00:00:10.620> call<00:00:10.860> rhythmic<00:00:11.400> conversion

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
something i call rhythmic conversion

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.870 
something i call rhythmic conversion
we're<00:00:12.900> going<00:00:13.050> to<00:00:13.110> take<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.500> Sango<00:00:14.309> pattern

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
we're going to take a Sango pattern

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.109 
we're going to take a Sango pattern
which<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.599> generally<00:00:16.049> played<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.710> 44<00:00:17.460> timing

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
which is generally played in 44 timing

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.050 
which is generally played in 44 timing
or<00:00:18.270> cut<00:00:19.109> time<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.590> well<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.100> we're<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
or cut time as well and we're going to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.250 
or cut time as well and we're going to
turn<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.480> into<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.750> 34<00:00:22.680> rhythm<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.730> originally

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
going to play four bars of a 68 pattern

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
now 68 and 34 are relative 68 is six

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.830 
now 68 and 34 are relative 68 is six
eighth<00:01:17.250> notes<00:01:18.170> 34<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.860> 68<00:01:20.580> notes<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.689> you'll

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
eighth notes 34 has 68 notes but you'll

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
eighth notes 34 has 68 notes but you'll
hear<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.439> these<00:01:22.650> two<00:01:22.950> rhythms<00:01:23.189> sound

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
hear the way these two rhythms sound

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
hear the way these two rhythms sound
against<00:01:24.360> each<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.500> quite

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
against each other and it's quite

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
against each other and it's quite
interesting<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.759> 68<00:01:27.360> pattern<00:01:27.960> i

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
interesting because the 68 pattern i

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
interesting because the 68 pattern i
play<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> heavy<00:01:29.939> accent<00:01:30.630> on

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
play is going to have a heavy accent on

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.970 
play is going to have a heavy accent on
for<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:45.650 

again<00:01:43.190> now<00:01:44.190> when<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.370> hear<00:01:44.460> how<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> song<00:01:45.390> go

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
again now when you hear how the song go

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.130 
again now when you hear how the song go
in<00:01:45.810> 34<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.860> converted<00:01:47.310> goes<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.600> 68

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
in 34 that we converted goes to the 68

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.920 
in 34 that we converted goes to the 68
makes<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.950> an<00:01:50.040> interesting<00:01:50.250> pattern<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.660> here

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
makes for an interesting pattern so here

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
makes for an interesting pattern so here
we<00:01:52.050> go<00:01:52.080> song<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.340> 3<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:53.700> 4<00:01:54.210> bars<00:01:54.510> in<00:01:55.160> 26<00:01:56.240> 844

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
we go song going 3 for 4 bars in 26 844

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:40.080 
we go song going 3 for 4 bars in 26 844
of<00:01:57.330> ours

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.000 

okay<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.150> let's<00:02:42.020> see<00:02:42.200> what<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.470> sounds<00:02:42.950> like

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
okay so let's see what this sounds like

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.580 
okay so let's see what this sounds like
just<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:44.180> bit<00:02:44.360> faster<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.080> again<00:02:45.350> all

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
just a little bit faster and again all

00:02:45.590 --> 00:03:25.570 
just a little bit faster and again all
this<00:02:45.770> will<00:02:45.920> be<00:02:46.010> on<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.160> board<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.940> end<00:03:24.580> all

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
this will be on the board on the end all

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.250 
this will be on the board on the end all
right<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.000> there<00:03:26.210> you<00:03:26.330> go<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.780> rhythmic

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
right so there you go the rhythmic

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.040 
right so there you go the rhythmic
conversion<00:03:27.920> take<00:03:28.790> your<00:03:29.000> favorite<00:03:29.510> rhythm<00:03:29.900> or

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
conversion take your favorite rhythm or

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.970 
conversion take your favorite rhythm or
style<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:31.810> take<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.959> initial<00:03:33.440> rhythm<00:03:33.800> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
style and take the initial rhythm and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.490 
style and take the initial rhythm and
see<00:03:34.910> what<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.180> could<00:03:35.270> sound<00:03:35.540> like<00:03:35.720> if<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.110> cut

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
see what it could sound like if you cut

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.220 
see what it could sound like if you cut
notes<00:03:36.830> off<00:03:37.130> or<00:03:37.370> even<00:03:37.640> add<00:03:37.910> notes<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.600> it's

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
notes off or even add notes to it it's

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.990 
notes off or even add notes to it it's
just<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.500> fun<00:03:39.770> way<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:39.980> create<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.489> different

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
just a fun way to create a different

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.270 
just a fun way to create a different
idea<00:03:41.360> no<00:03:41.600> matter<00:03:41.630> what<00:03:42.110> musical<00:03:42.590> styles<00:03:43.130> you
