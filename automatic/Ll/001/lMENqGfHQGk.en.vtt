00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.250
 and activate another microphone 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 configure this microphone and makes 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.030

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.489
 if that's what you see as here 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.440
 once again information about yours 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.789
 microphone drivers you can drivers 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 update and now again 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.530
 more details here you can see yours 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 Microphone has connected to devices 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 Use you must select device 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 you can activate it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.680
 otherwise he is not quiet in the second 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.689
 you can listen to riders here 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.040
 select this device as playback 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.080
 Source I absolutely must use 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.909
 the tick rausmachen because otherwise a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.950
 There is a rush or a glare 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.470
 other problems makes these hacks 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 absolutely out times playback of this 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.049
 Depending on what the device once was 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 select both that is actually 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.630
 pretty much no matter 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 I have speakers realtech high 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 definition audio selected at 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 power management, I recommend you the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 to go out with battery operation continues 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 execute because at automatically 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.189
 deactivated to save energy there is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.680
 know problems you can recognize devices 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.119
 check this level 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.210
 most important of all 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.310
 I put my microphone to 45% 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.950
 this is the volume the louder you are 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.960
 which provides eg 100% run your 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.850
 Microphones full volume then hear 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 I clearly shout on it 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.299
 45% posed because my microphone so am 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.729
 works best and so on 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.379
 audio quality is best on the microphone 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.010
 bus can you adjust how much bosom 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.470
 should have gotten 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.239
 This is already 20 markets 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.950
 the quality is above detail the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.390
 it would still set to 30 now 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.659
 be distorted and noisy 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.799
 That's why I put this at ten percent 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.680
 it would be zero percent it would 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.730
 just shit quietly sound 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.319
 I am improving this wider 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.750
 after that again because of the hero 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.129
 employees together and can expand 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.900
 you choose the format of a microphone 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.690
 By default, it is mostly at 44,000 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.790
 100 hertz cd-quality 16 with 2 channels 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.810
 adjusted 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.579
 This is also the best for your 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.769
 be a microphone if I changed something 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.209
 I have not clicked by default 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.329
 easy to restore to standards 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.950
 my microphone runs by default with 66 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.750
 90,000 heart I recommend you 44,100 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.370
 heart if you have an external recording 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.500
 first with the city ​​becomes the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.780
 file smaller and second the consequences 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.799
 Advantages sound clear 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.889
 there is no noise at 6 90 1192 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.260
 death heart since the first is quiet and 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.720
 second, extremely noisy because of it 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.370
 I always recommend you this here or 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.780
 for that your microphone manages 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.609
 also have a study microphone on 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.019
 pc connected what I now synonymous for 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.030
 I can use these shots if I have 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.569
 I would not like to introduce anything 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.030
 Of course I have 192,000 otherwise 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.609
 you recommend this only here 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.919
 however the two fixes in 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.079
 would you heart it now 44,000 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.579
 Here are some improvement 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.180
 sometimes two riders 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.489
 You can hook this to the recommendation 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.319
 that was my little tutorial like you 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.030
 you can hire me and rausche 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.470
 I hope I could remove 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.010
 help you and see you at 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.010
 next time again
