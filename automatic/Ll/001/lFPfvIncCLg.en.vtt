00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.370 
got these things which I can bend
together<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:24.120> go<00:02:24.239> on<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.050> then

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
together they go on like this and then

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.590 
together they go on like this and then
since<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> wood<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:26.850> kind<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.090> ready<00:02:27.269> bent

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
since the wood was kind of ready bent

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.449 
since the wood was kind of ready bent
like<00:02:28.019> when<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.230> got<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.800> bought<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.280> I

Bentley<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.769> kind<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.480> made<00:02:36.480> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
Bentley just so I just kind of made the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.720 
Bentley just so I just kind of made the
two<00:02:36.720> bent<00:02:36.959> ones<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.980> each<00:02:38.040> size<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.519> he's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
two bent ones for each size this he's

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850 
two bent ones for each size this he's
running<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:39.989> side<00:02:40.200> curved<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.739> like

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
running in for this side curved in like

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.460 
running in for this side curved in like
that<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.250> then<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.450> one<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.930> bent<00:02:43.290> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that and then this one here is bent in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.410 
that and then this one here is bent in
on<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.799> side<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.400> completely<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
on this side so completely like that

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.610 
on this side so completely like that
and<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.840> they<00:02:45.989> look<00:02:46.110> really<00:02:46.290> good<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and so then they look really good in you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.800 
and so then they look really good in you
and<00:02:46.890> I'll<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:47.640> stop<00:02:47.880> curving<00:02:48.390> together<00:02:48.600> and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and I'll just stop curving together and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.090 
and I'll just stop curving together and
like<00:02:49.019> screw<00:02:49.320> them<00:02:49.410> down<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.769> just<00:02:50.010> like

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
like screw them down here just like

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.800 
like screw them down here just like
moving<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.450> then<00:02:51.570> eventually

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
moving like that and then eventually

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.650 
moving like that and then eventually
I'll<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> final<00:02:53.370> coat<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.580> fiberglass<00:02:54.390> and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
I'll do the final coat of fiberglass and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.020 
I'll do the final coat of fiberglass and
like<00:02:54.810> silicone<00:02:55.769> sealant<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.760> stuff

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
like silicone sealant and all that stuff

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.000 
like silicone sealant and all that stuff
so<00:02:57.090> yeah<00:02:57.480> I'll<00:02:58.200> sure<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> looks<00:02:58.739> like<00:02:58.769> when<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so yeah I'll sure it looks like when I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:10.699 
so yeah I'll sure it looks like when I
get<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.220> all<00:02:59.310> assembled

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.780 

okay<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.250> pretty<00:03:12.370> much<00:03:12.489> what<00:03:12.700> it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
okay so this is pretty much what it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.150 
okay so this is pretty much what it
looks<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.120> I'll<00:03:13.300> put<00:03:13.480> together<00:03:13.569> now<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:15.040> new

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
looks like I'll put together now the new

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.740 
looks like I'll put together now the new
whole<00:03:15.430> everything<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.420> haven't<00:03:16.599> put

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
whole everything but I just haven't put

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.500 
whole everything but I just haven't put
those<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.260> bottom<00:03:17.650> piece<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.129> yet<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.300> off

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
those that bottom piece on yet but off

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.350 
those that bottom piece on yet but off
yeah<00:03:20.379> it's<00:03:20.590> pretty<00:03:21.160> dang<00:03:21.400> nice<00:03:21.670> actually<00:03:21.940> um

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
he's worth this on this side wine that's

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.920 
he's worth this on this side wine that's
pretty<00:03:25.840> dang<00:03:25.989> lined<00:03:26.980> up<00:03:27.160> pretty<00:03:27.340> nicely<00:03:27.550> off

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
pretty dang lined up pretty nicely off

pretty dang lined up pretty nicely off
what<00:03:28.930> I'm<00:03:28.989> gonna<00:03:29.080> do<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.410> eventually<00:03:29.650> like

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
what I'm gonna do is eventually like

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.460 
what I'm gonna do is eventually like
squeeze<00:03:30.250> gather<00:03:30.519> because<00:03:30.700> there's<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.970> lot<00:03:31.180> of

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
squeeze gather because there's a lot of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.470 
squeeze gather because there's a lot of
flexing<00:03:32.470> or<00:03:32.680> these<00:03:33.130> are<00:03:33.250> pretty<00:03:34.000> tightly

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
flexing or these are pretty tightly

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.300 
flexing or these are pretty tightly
trying<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:35.019> pulley<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.379> I<00:03:35.410> glued<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.099> in

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
trying to like pulley but I glued it in

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.530 
trying to like pulley but I glued it in
there<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.580> it's<00:03:36.700> super<00:03:36.970> tight<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.180> off<00:03:37.330> left

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
tape on it I just got to glue it in here

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.670 
tape on it I just got to glue it in here
a<00:03:39.430> little<00:03:39.519> more<00:03:39.790> um<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:41.140> yeah<00:03:41.349> it's<00:03:41.560> pretty

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
or not fiberglass it with a fiberglass

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.720 
or not fiberglass it with a fiberglass
resin<00:03:57.579> or<00:03:57.819> reason<00:03:58.120> or<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.329> say<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.890> then<00:04:00.579> on

I'll<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.870> like<00:04:02.049> make<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> shaft<00:04:02.890> system<00:04:03.489> and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
I'll just like make a shaft system and

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.479 
I'll just like make a shaft system and
did<00:04:04.329> propeller<00:04:05.130> electronics<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.310> all<00:04:06.370> that

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
did propeller electronics and all that

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.780 
did propeller electronics and all that
stuff<00:04:06.760> so<00:04:07.000> yeah<00:04:08.069> what's<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.130> fiberglass

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
stuff so yeah what's that fiberglass

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.759 
stuff so yeah what's that fiberglass
that<00:04:09.819> I'll<00:04:10.090> show<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.720> then<00:04:10.810> I'll<00:04:11.290> make
