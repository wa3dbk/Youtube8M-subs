car I love the the lines I mean I know
some<00:04:26.320> people<00:04:26.350> don't<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.700> style<00:04:28.000> of<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
some people don't like the style of the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.370 
some people don't like the style of the
slk<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.980> I<00:04:30.130> prefer<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.610> SL<00:04:31.210> over<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.020> slk

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
slk and I prefer the SL over the slk

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.270 
slk and I prefer the SL over the slk
obviously<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.240> slk<00:04:34.740> has<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.770> little<00:04:36.160> bit

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
obviously but the slk has a little bit

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.610 
obviously but the slk has a little bit
of<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.460> magic<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.450> just<00:04:37.510> especially<00:04:38.500> the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
of a magic to it it just especially the

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.070 
of a magic to it it just especially the
AMG<00:04:39.100> version<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.700> we<00:04:39.790> have<00:04:40.000> here<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.960> is

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
AMG version that we have here this is

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.960 
AMG version that we have here this is
just<00:04:41.230> like<00:04:41.320> a<00:04:41.500> little<00:04:41.740> magic<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:42.640> car<00:04:42.850> and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
just like a little magic to this car and

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.000 
just like a little magic to this car and
you<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.210> see<00:04:43.360> we're<00:04:43.510> on<00:04:43.540> Tsukuba<00:04:44.170> again<00:04:44.470> my

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
you can see we're on Tsukuba again my

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.220 
you can see we're on Tsukuba again my
favorite<00:04:45.520> drift<00:04:45.760> track<00:04:46.090> well<00:04:46.870> one<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.170> my

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
favorite drift track well one of my

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.440 
favorite drift track well one of my
favorite<00:04:47.530> drift<00:04:47.710> tracks<00:04:48.010> but<00:04:48.370> it's<00:04:48.610> probably

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
favorite drift tracks but it's probably

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.260 
favorite drift tracks but it's probably
my<00:04:49.690> favorite<00:04:50.140> I'd<00:04:50.260> have<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.650> say<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.070> as<00:04:51.910> we

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
my favorite I'd have to say and as we

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.610 
my favorite I'd have to say and as we
did<00:04:52.390> in<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.540> last<00:04:52.690> video<00:04:52.900> we're<00:04:53.260> going<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.410> do

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
did in the last video we're going to do

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.490 
did in the last video we're going to do
cockpit<00:04:54.130> view<00:04:54.250> first<00:04:54.690> third<00:04:55.690> person<00:04:56.080> second

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
cockpit view first third person second

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.340 
cockpit view first third person second
so<00:04:57.160> let's<00:04:57.640> just<00:04:57.820> get<00:04:57.910> into<00:04:58.210> kind<00:04:58.990> of<00:04:59.050> how<00:04:59.170> this

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
so let's just get into kind of how this

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.490 
so let's just get into kind of how this
car<00:04:59.590> feels<00:04:59.860> it's<00:05:00.870> it's<00:05:01.870> kind<00:05:02.140> of<00:05:02.200> hard<00:05:02.440> to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
car feels it's it's kind of hard to

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.960 
car feels it's it's kind of hard to
describe<00:05:02.680> but<00:05:03.430> its<00:05:04.000> grippy<00:05:04.870> during<00:05:05.680> during<00:05:06.610> a

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
describe but its grippy during during a

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.830 
describe but its grippy during during a
drift<00:05:07.800> but<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:09.040> slides<00:05:09.910> really<00:05:10.240> well<00:05:10.570> I<00:05:10.600> don't

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
drift but it slides really well I don't

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.830 
drift but it slides really well I don't
know<00:05:11.020> it's<00:05:11.170> hard<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.590> explain<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:12.400> but<00:05:13.060> it<00:05:13.390> I

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
know it's hard to explain that but it I

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.020 
know it's hard to explain that but it I
don't<00:05:14.650> know<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.830> best<00:05:14.980> way<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.250> say<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.820> I

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
don't know the best way to say it is I

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.900 
don't know the best way to say it is I
think<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.390> holds<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.110> slide<00:05:17.460> really<00:05:18.460> really

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
think it holds the slide really really

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.400 
think it holds the slide really really
well<00:05:19.210> there's<00:05:19.840> no<00:05:21.750> fiddling<00:05:22.750> around<00:05:22.900> there's

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
well there's no fiddling around there's

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.060 
well there's no fiddling around there's
no<00:05:23.940> you<00:05:24.940> know<00:05:25.350> fishtailing<00:05:26.350> or<00:05:26.680> going<00:05:26.950> all

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
no you know fishtailing or going all

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.430 
no you know fishtailing or going all
over<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.400> place<00:05:27.490> between<00:05:28.110> drifts<00:05:29.110> or<00:05:29.260> in<00:05:29.350> the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
over the place between drifts or in the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.910 
over the place between drifts or in the
middle<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.770> a<00:05:29.860> drift<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:30.190> can<00:05:30.310> see<00:05:30.490> it's<00:05:30.610> just

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
middle of a drift you can see it's just

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.180 
middle of a drift you can see it's just
it's<00:05:32.920> just<00:05:33.100> very<00:05:33.880> very<00:05:34.090> stable<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.380> once<00:05:35.980> you

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
it's just very very stable it once you

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.910 
it's just very very stable it once you
get<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.610> sideways<00:05:37.450> it<00:05:37.750> just<00:05:38.380> doesn't<00:05:38.560> want<00:05:38.770> to

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
get it sideways it just doesn't want to

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.560 
get it sideways it just doesn't want to
break<00:05:39.070> that<00:05:39.310> position<00:05:39.850> and<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.150> only<00:05:40.330> need

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
break that position and you only need

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.860 
break that position and you only need
light<00:05:41.290> light<00:05:41.680> light<00:05:41.730> corrections<00:05:42.730> to<00:05:43.300> drift

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
light light light corrections to drift

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.610 
light light light corrections to drift
this<00:05:44.050> car<00:05:44.290> it's<00:05:44.470> very<00:05:44.800> stable<00:05:45.250> very<00:05:46.150> fun<00:05:46.810> to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
this car it's very stable very fun to

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.040 
this car it's very stable very fun to
use<00:05:47.860> actually<00:05:48.430> it's<00:05:48.550> quite<00:05:48.760> fun<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.120> use<00:05:49.450> not

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
use actually it's quite fun to use not

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.220 
use actually it's quite fun to use not
quite<00:05:50.320> as<00:05:50.470> fun<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.830> use<00:05:51.070> as<00:05:51.280> that<00:05:51.910> 1970<00:05:52.810> Camaro

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
quite as fun to use as that 1970 Camaro

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.730 
quite as fun to use as that 1970 Camaro
but<00:05:54.000> still<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.030> fun<00:05:55.330> car<00:05:55.570> to<00:05:55.600> use<00:05:55.900> definitely<00:05:56.590> I

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
but still a fun car to use definitely I

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.520 
but still a fun car to use definitely I
suppose<00:05:57.520> since<00:05:58.030> it's<00:05:58.180> so<00:05:58.510> stable<00:05:59.110> that<00:05:59.350> it

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
suppose since it's so stable that it

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.830 
suppose since it's so stable that it
would<00:05:59.650> be<00:05:59.740> a<00:05:59.770> good<00:06:00.010> tandem<00:06:00.370> in<00:06:00.670> car<00:06:00.970> I<00:06:01.210> haven't

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
would be a good tandem in car I haven't

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.000 
would be a good tandem in car I haven't
tried<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.110> with<00:06:02.920> in<00:06:03.400> a<00:06:03.490> tandem<00:06:03.970> drifting

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
tried it with in a tandem drifting

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.160 
tried it with in a tandem drifting
situation<00:06:06.010> yet<00:06:06.280> but<00:06:06.970> i<00:06:07.150> probably<00:06:07.510> will<00:06:07.870> soon

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
situation yet but i probably will soon

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.630 
situation yet but i probably will soon
because<00:06:08.500> this<00:06:08.710> car<00:06:08.890> seems<00:06:09.160> like<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:09.490> would<00:06:09.580> be

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640
