00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.720
 hello that such a good android fan 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.420
 Today again I bring you this video 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.600
 tutorial let's do this 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.269
 fifa update with version 1.3 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.519
 point zero that today has again 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.100
 updated yesterday but I 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.289
 being a video today we're going 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.570
 make a sample of 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.339
 of installation because there are some users 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.030
 they do not understand in that one and two videos 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:32.439
 that are already 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:34.510
 on my channel and this is going to be one more 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.579
 because that usually people 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.930
 that are still 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.560
 a little confused 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.960
 well in this version there is not much 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.530
 many improvements 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.850
 what we are going to do is the same as in 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.210
 the previous video what we are going to do 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.460
 is that here is 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.460
 at the moment by change of hand 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.780
 that what we are going to do is we have 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.870
 the data for those who have 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 installed the game in the lower part the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.510
 version 1.281 2.9 what we need if 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.690
 is that they still have install games 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.390
 we're just going to see to rename not 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.240
 again in what is the data in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.250
 this case for closures installs as 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 you will see I take the internal memory in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.590
 external memory we have the data and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.520
 I have all the transactions that have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.190
 to serve copy or not copy the origin 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.080
 the option to copy what I already have 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.200
 installed and what they have to do 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.990
 you are going to copy to memory 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.990
 internal of your cell phone 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:04.130
 and we chose the android folder 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.950
 and the folder and we put it as 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.610
 explain I return installed so 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 well we count here and that's where 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 you see that it is renamed to 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.740
 you to 128 129 I like it and have to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.670
 do is grab click and change the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.200
 first name 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.000
 and that's where you have to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:33.540
 choose this to change hands and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.810
 renown that feels that 630 the moment 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.510
 of appointment 128 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.110
 with 130 are a hundred that have good 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.110
 and 130 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.250
 and it indicates good and not once 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.580
 you have the folder and 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.020
 and they have renamed the data with the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.650
 folder or we go to the installer 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.880
 install in the freckle with that version and the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.790
 we give that is all ok now let's do 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.120
 a test 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.190
 the game 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.730
 to see that the game is good 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.730
 you see 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.960
 ah 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.890
 let's put a match 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.890
 Quick 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.580
 As you can see I am connected with a 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.580
 story 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.769
 and then what were we waiting for? 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.650
 many hope that this time 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.060
 we can play online but good we go 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.489
 have to wait for another future 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.370
 update and we see if that improves not 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.030
 but others have gone well says that 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.030
 there have been improvements 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.610
 but above all, why 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.320
 as they do not see I do not know when with a year 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.060
 in the same 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.950
 to the 10th of communism we have 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.700
 the wise the tuning can download 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.440
 we are going to see it 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.050
 we are in a deep valley I think 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.750
 was 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.180
 we have given 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.180
 they had still in shock 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.749
 well are those in back 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.680
 yes 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.760
 I could get to the bottom line before 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.050
 of focusing eyes that will have problems 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.050
 at the time of receiving it 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.909
 a short 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:32.399
 yes gentlemen back they were magnificent 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.680
 to end the first day for a 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.680
 very tight marker 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.080
 principal if it's not for me 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:00.420
 to play online we can compete with 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.170
 our users 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:07.770
 if we play some games and we admit 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.770
 aggregates 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:15.310
 but you liked it will be for the 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.310
 next video share something here 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.759
 because he can not stay alive 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.759
 they tell him everything 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.930
 brain we have
