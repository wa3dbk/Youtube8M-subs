00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 beautiful under youtube philippe 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 rossier I welcome very much in the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.130
 see new episode sheldon wood m 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.010
 I think it's a really interesting topic 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.290
 it's about how much you like muscle mass 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.350
 One builds up per training if it is complete 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.789
 important things like that also in smaller ones 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.359
 break down units 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.560
 prerequisite for this video is 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.779
 someone who does natural bodybuilding 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 So do not take steroids and none 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.570
 supplements takes that are the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 experience values ​​I pass on now 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.599
 can 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 There are some theories on the subject 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 the whole so much muscle in the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.600
 end-up one builds each year either 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.120
 depending on the body weight you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 show or as an absolute weight i 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 always try the different ones 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.399
 to link theories 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 the whole now just out of mine 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.710
 Experience it will be at the beginning of it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.700
 assumed that someone per year are 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.559
 not even trained and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.300
 then go into training between 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.289
 eight and ten kilograms of muscle mass 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 build up 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.980
 that depends in the end on several 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.030
 Factors starting at factor 1 will be okay 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.640
 The training is now for 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.409
 example of the newcomer then things like 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.880
 for example, as is the genetics altogether 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.460
 important number three trainings 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.510
 Experiences know nutritional experience 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.680
 know and fifth that is 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 probably also the equipment 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.369
 one is available that is if 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.869
 you look at me now, for example 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.799
 At the beginning somebody started to 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.970
 train with very little training 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.990
 I do want to say training very much 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.330
 Little idea of ​​the training theory 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.900
 as well as nutritional theory and me 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.259
 at the beginning of each year between scarce 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 built four and six kilo yes what 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.790
 after that happens if someone in his 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 Training progresses over the years 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.520
 He is less and less of muscle mass 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.689
 you have to research the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.549
 big muscle parts are then 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.979
 most likely already trained 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.299
 that means for example the legs the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.009
 make up a large part as well as to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.110
 for example, the back much smaller 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.520
 Muscles are obviously open though 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.829
 also post etc 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.500
 that means you will become each year if you 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.899
 continue to train less and less build up 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.759
 my experience is now, for example 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.000
 Last years I have almost every year 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.579
 natural without steroids without supplements 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.429
 about 3 kilograms of muscle mass is built up 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.599
 were injured ten from 86 to 89 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:18.190
 last year 89 also on 92 and now 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.110
 It is in the middle of 2015 and I am 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.510
 somewhere around 94 kilograms so it is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.049
 again, he will not care 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.220
 rauslaufen 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.720
 We can do the whole fair course 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.069
 could somehow medical with order 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.239
 which leaks mass mails or something 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.010
 determine otherwise, of course 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.569
 even if he either one very much 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.680
 comparable body fat percentage off or 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.019
 if you just realize 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.310
 or ensure that you are too 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.480
 certain time again the same 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.340
 body fat percentage off as for example 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.680
 Phase Phase Definition Phase Power 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.209
 then that can be very much in any case 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.950
 good compare to the original 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.329
 question of the video to come hey how much 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.640
 you need muscle mass in one 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.930
 Training now just take as 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.299
 At first, for example, someone builds as 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.760
 beginner 5 kilograms of muscle mass per 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.440
 year on that was simply mean mine 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760
 experience value then I could 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.530
 imagine the year twelve months that 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.389
 means you need 400 per month 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.040
 muscle mass on if you five times 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.459
 the week is 20 times a day 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.769
 month 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.150
 builds your pro training about 20 km 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.980
 muscle mass on resp 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.329
 yes you do not build the muscle mass per 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.250
 Training on or not in the 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.260
 training but the whole is in 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.060
 end effect by the muscle stimulus in the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.660
 training that is the 20km muscle mass 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.340
 These moments will be the result of 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.450
 trainings activity this for someone 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.099
 I've been in training for a while now 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.690
 example current as I said quite 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.389
 constant the last years always three 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.870
 kilogram of muscle mass that the 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.579
 month about 250 grams of muscle mass at 20 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.280
 So one training day per month is one 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.359
 training day in the end for about 12 5 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.010
 muscle mass responsible for that 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.299
 Just take a look 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.769
 to give as I said that always depends on 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.660
 the factors genetics yours 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.010
 training level nutritional knowledge 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.060
 know training and of course 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.609
 Maybe you just equipment 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.319
 the then the parameters in the end effect 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.180
 to break down a bit 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:02.079
 I say goodbye to the next one 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.730
 so I hope the video has 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.530
 you like it when you ask me 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.680
 want to support companies then give 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.120
 the video like tells best 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.010
 girlfriend of oppresses and decides 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.989
 john rawls stops by the shop with us 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.680
 it really gets a lot of me 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.720
 mean 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.099
 We were in German for the company 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.229
 business jobs in 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.120
 germany creates and what customers on 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.030
 a smile on the face of the whole world 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.740
 we should try to do fitness and fitness 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.810
 bodybuilding piece to do better with
