00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.960 

I<00:00:16.619> think<00:00:17.619> in<00:00:17.740> Abu<00:00:17.980> Dhabi<00:00:18.010> we're<00:00:18.490> seeing<00:00:18.730> a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
I think in Abu Dhabi we're seeing a

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.700 
I think in Abu Dhabi we're seeing a
slightly<00:00:19.210> different<00:00:19.570> but<00:00:20.050> comparable

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
slightly different but comparable

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.450 
slightly different but comparable
phenomenon<00:00:21.430> in<00:00:21.730> that<00:00:22.060> dedicated<00:00:23.050> group<00:00:23.529> I<00:00:23.830> can

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
phenomenon in that dedicated group I can

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.310 
phenomenon in that dedicated group I can
say<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.760> you<00:00:24.939> I<00:00:25.029> think<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.570> guggenheim<00:00:26.290> museum

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
say to you I think the guggenheim museum

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.609 
say to you I think the guggenheim museum
would<00:00:26.710> be<00:00:26.920> much<00:00:27.220> less<00:00:27.550> well-known<00:00:28.029> today<00:00:28.689> but

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
would be much less well-known today but

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.920 
would be much less well-known today but

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
abstraction we also wanted to look at

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.410 
abstraction we also wanted to look at

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
october of 1959 so that became the

endpoint for the exhibition for us we

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.330 
endpoint for the exhibition for us we
were<00:01:41.660> also<00:01:41.930> thinking<00:01:42.229> about<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.650> space<00:01:43.040> we

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
were also thinking about the space we

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.310 
were also thinking about the space we
made<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> site<00:01:43.820> visit<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.240> Abu<00:01:44.390> Dhabi<00:01:44.509> in<00:01:44.990> June

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.290 
made a site visit to Abu Dhabi in June
to<00:01:45.590> confirm<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.460> work<00:01:46.729> we'd<00:01:46.910> been<00:01:47.060> doing

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
to confirm that the work we'd been doing

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.690 
to confirm that the work we'd been doing
in<00:01:47.420> our<00:01:47.509> models<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:47.990> New<00:01:48.110> York<00:01:48.490> was<00:01:49.490> really

in our models in New York was really

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.249 
in our models in New York was really
going<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.910> fit<00:01:50.060> into<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.390> space<00:01:50.540> was<00:01:50.930> going<00:01:51.170> to

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
going to fit into the space was going to

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.080 
going to fit into the space was going to
look<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.740> its<00:01:51.860> best<00:01:52.040> advantage<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.850> one<00:01:52.970> of

the things we discovered by coming here

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.440 
the things we discovered by coming here
was<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.430> we<00:01:55.580> could<00:01:55.759> use<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.119> existing

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
was that we could use the existing

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.450 
was that we could use the existing
architecture<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.380> space<00:01:57.619> to<00:01:58.160> help<00:01:58.369> us

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
architecture of the space to help us

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.700 
architecture of the space to help us
with<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.850> breaks<00:01:59.119> between<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.600> galleries
