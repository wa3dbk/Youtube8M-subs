00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
with my ologist so that the air the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020

as<00:01:33.450> you're<00:01:33.600> compressing<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.290> another<00:01:35.250> thing<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
as you're compressing it another thing I

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
as you're compressing it another thing I
also<00:01:35.729> did<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.479> would<00:01:36.600> suggest<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> do

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
also did and I would suggest that you do

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
also did and I would suggest that you do
too<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.619> take<00:01:37.920> some<00:01:38.100> wd-40<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.000> whatever<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
too is take some wd-40 or whatever and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.810 
too is take some wd-40 or whatever and
right<00:01:39.750> wipe<00:01:40.079> off<00:01:40.259> any<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> residue<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
right wipe off any of the residue the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
right wipe off any of the residue the
sticky<00:01:42.119> residue<00:01:42.450> left<00:01:42.689> behind<00:01:42.840> from<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.290> tag

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
sticky residue left behind from the tag

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039 
sticky residue left behind from the tag
and<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.180> that'll<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.899> when

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and because what that'll do is if when

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.539 
and because what that'll do is if when
you<00:01:46.140> put<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.350> together<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.890> stickiness<00:01:47.399> will

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you put it together the stickiness will

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.760 
you put it together the stickiness will
make<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:47.939> hard<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> put<00:01:48.540> apart<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
make it really hard to put apart so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.280 
make it really hard to put apart so
again<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> did<00:01:50.399> here<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.820> took<00:01:51.290> two

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
again all I did here is I took two

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.429 
again all I did here is I took two
two-liter<00:01:53.009> bottles<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.049> made<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
two-liter bottles you know made one a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.139 
two-liter bottles you know made one a
little<00:01:55.770> bit<00:01:55.920> bigger<00:01:56.159> than<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> other<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.759> did

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
little bit bigger than the other I did

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.730 
little bit bigger than the other I did
have<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.390> originally<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.960> same<00:01:58.140> size<00:01:58.409> but

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
have them originally the same size but

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.860 
have them originally the same size but
it<00:01:58.829> made<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.399> bit<00:01:59.610> harder

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
it made it a little bit harder

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.930 
it made it a little bit harder
pull<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.200> out<00:02:00.260> I<00:02:00.620> poked<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:01.550> hole<00:02:01.670> through<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
pull that out I poked a hole through the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.880 
pull that out I poked a hole through the
smaller<00:02:02.270> one<00:02:02.540> just<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.050> air<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:03.590> the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
smaller one just so that the air and the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.190 
smaller one just so that the air and the
suction<00:02:04.370> can<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.970> little<00:02:05.630> bit<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.870> air<00:02:05.990> can

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
suction can a little bit of the air can

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.680 
suction can a little bit of the air can
escape<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.890> left<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> other<00:02:07.880> one<00:02:08.000> intact<00:02:08.450> and

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
escape I left the other one intact and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.480 
escape I left the other one intact and
actually<00:02:09.020> what<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.290> does<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.680> is<00:02:09.740> kind<00:02:10.460> of

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
actually what this does this is kind of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.310 
actually what this does this is kind of
a<00:02:10.550> multifunctional<00:02:11.150> thing<00:02:11.570> now<00:02:11.780> because<00:02:11.960> now

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
a multifunctional thing now because now
