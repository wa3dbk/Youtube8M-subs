he's<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.469> average<00:00:46.950> defensively<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:48.030> his

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
he's only average defensively like his

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.450 
he's only average defensively like his
average<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> defensive<00:00:49.469> stats<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:50.129> jump

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
average is defensive stats don't jump

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
average is defensive stats don't jump

business<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.629> he's<00:00:54.629> only<00:00:54.780> averaged<00:00:55.320> like

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
business but he's only averaged like

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
business but he's only averaged like
it's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> semi<00:00:56.399> low<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.780> you
