00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.660
 and this starts with a mini break 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.660
 if someone rafa now the first serve 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.070
 do not see rafa that is over 10 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.290
 10 has pulled out there is an advance are 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.570
 the rest is very short remains too 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.570
 for gold they are 1.1 equal 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.140
 no no 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.540
 and trust has that right that the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.290
 has very good planting and when the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.040
 ball goes so so noble so close to the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.880
 net 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.880
 tsonga the bust 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.750
 21 tsonga 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.660
 in this tiebreak of the second set 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.430
 and now they are two very tense points nacho 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 with this 2 to 1 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.290
 Rafa is going to have to take a deep breath and 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.240
 forget about everything that has happened 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.240
 and having managed to recompose his tennis 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.050
 he entered 30 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.300
 enter in an amazing miraculous way 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.100
 a ball that is stuffed rafa that seemed 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.160
 but that was not that good start 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 but who laments are equal members 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.800
 and I guess you have to have a lot 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.690
 talent to put talent and magic 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.030
 defensive tomás can not do anything else 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.540
 the right has a very long right 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 powerful rafa puts the racket that the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.330
 players who puts the racket in the appointment 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.700
 the tier is rafa puts it on the line 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.770
 loses good humor despite the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.820
 tension that is now living in 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.820
 this phase of the match 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.080
 we will say that good serve 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.080
 what good serve and at what time 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.290
 rafa saved a point practically 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.230
 he lost the previous and now he has won 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.600
 the latter with much conviction now 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.600
 the ballot has has tsonga 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.859
 what good serve 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.280
 he thinks that he relies on that service to 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:25.469
 go up and make that short volley and 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.469
 crusade that I could not reach 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.640
 is that he has a pump kick 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.640
 that is to say that a right the lethal blows 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.200
 there is the one that has just inserted rafa 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.810
 it's impossible and I evoke the bananas 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.970
 ok that's a miracle tomás is a 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.770
 authentic miracle apart is that the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.140
 players know he's going to go there and it's 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.500
 impossible then it serves to put it but 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.110
 as they raise it like the list and it falls to 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.770
 weight at the bottom of the track hoot 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.160
 It's amazing how he gets that hit 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:12.250
 they are gas I knew it was going and yet 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.170
 is unable to fight the impossible 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.209
 and how important this point is 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.980
 to another side and how is this possible 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.980
 it is more extensive still 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.130
 x 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.780
 very well rafa now the corridor so 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.620
 open well the point two long punches 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.620
 deep 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.960
 and now to see if rafa returns to look for the 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 direct serve that would be a magnificent 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.740
 option or however you prefer to play 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.180
 conservative 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.180
 looking for the rebel tsonga 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.960
 to the body 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.160
 it goes the whole hallway of that hit 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.639
 cut to one hand and again very well 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.499
 we will not say come, I know what to tell you 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.189
 he does not want to say anything you have to put up with 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:25.720
 fifth match ball and concentrate 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:28.150
 concentrate on the point 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.230
 we can take relaxed 3rd 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.700
 phase that should be with maximum 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.060
 concentration after what has 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.060
 past 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.800
 I know I need to have been there 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:57.750
 here to see here 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.409
 there is no yes there is and that's when 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.289
 rafa smiles because he has been able to close 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.650
 the match has won the tie break of the 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.860
 second set 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:14.710
 73 has made it very difficult 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:19.940
 tsonga therefore match game set 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:23.970
 rafa nadal 2 set a 0 6 3 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.300
 76 in the end the match has had a 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.789
 Unexpected emotion has been imposed on Rafael 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.060
 nadal therefore we have the name of 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:35.060
