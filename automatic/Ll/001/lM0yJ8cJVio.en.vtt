00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.490
 welcome to this next video on the 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.040
 mathematics academy where we are going to show 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.719
 how to handle large numbers 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.610
 and before you start calculating with large 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.240
 number is that important that you are large 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.110
 numbers 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.910
 easy to note and fall from 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.619
 is meant the scientific notation 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.960
 with this your large number can send an email 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.380
 shame may consist of 12 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.810
 zeros or 12 digits or 20 digits that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.520
 so that you can go short or easier 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.170
 can start recording in a shorter form 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.770
 that you don't have to use all those digits 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.750
 write and therefore to large numbers 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.370
 handy to note times so use 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.380
 of scientific notation 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.780
 how do you write a large number 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.550
 in scientific notation but 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.720
 let's get an easy number 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.890
 names 7.45 million when we use 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.660
 this in the scientific notation 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.770
 want to write then we go as follows 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.690
 at work 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.970
 we are going to move the comma like this 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
 that you only have one digit for that 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.790
 comma 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.700
 and then you go all those zeros that 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.380
 have that you leave out so you get 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.420
 always a figure what you so 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.000
 eventually you have between one or one 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.550
 number between one and the team 7.5 white 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.600
 body between the first and the ten 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.790
 anyway we all have zeros 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.540
 omitted taken so this is actually 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.280
 another number that has to be repeated 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.480
 because it is actually too small and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.130
 you see 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.710
 comma was actually behind those zeros 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.940
 which is then the six places 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 moved to get 7.45 so you have 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.290
 actually divided by a million 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.810
 namely 6 to 6 divisions of 10 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.210
 in short, we divide by a million that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.860
 means that we actually have to turn around 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.870
 a boy to do the same again 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.370
 so there are 7 million 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:00.320
 We can also write 450,000 from 7.45 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.210
 times a million okay we're almost there 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.280
 the scientific notation says 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.610
 namely that we then have that number with all those 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.010
 zeros 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.790
 what a million frame or 10 million or 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.429
 billion 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.640
 we will write a summary and how we can 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.379
 we now note such numbers other short ones 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.840
 and we must make use of the 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.590
 powers of 10 and as we know it is ten 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.450
 to the honor 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.110
 it is equal to ten motif on the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.510
 second 10 squared is 100 that third 1000 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.060
 ink 4 10,000 10 to the 5th 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.440
 100,000 and for example 10 to the 6th and 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.599
 millions like that of course 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.200
 online free is important to continue and 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.660
 know the figure in exponent 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 that is always the same as the number 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.540
 zeros 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.140
 when you have over million you have with 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.580
 six zeros make 10 to the 6th 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.980
 so we can write this so we 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.319
 now just write 7.45 not 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.079
 turn the wall but turn 10 to the 6th and 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.340
 this is therefore the same number 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.430
 noted in the scientific 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.260
 notation well writing 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.790
 scientific tation it's handy though 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.530
 also being able to read from 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.840
 scientific notation and know what 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.989
 that number is therefore useful because 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.299
 often enough you have that number somewhere 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.019
 in occurs or your calculator such 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.060
 number 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.310
 suppose you see rekem for order 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.180
 the number gives 6.34 once 10 to the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.620
 8th 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.709
 Then it's handy that you know about it too 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.430
 In any case, this is exactly how you can 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.269
 write it back the same way 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.310
 6.34 one 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.989
 we have been here for 3 decimal places 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.160
 want to have 10 to the 8th so we have 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.160
 actually want the eight decimal places 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.389
 exist how do you get that by just 5 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.139
 and add the le 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.569
 when you remove the comma then 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.730
 we are exactly the number in this case 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.359
 what this represents 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.459
 so 600 34 million 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.739
 100,000 that is actually the case that we 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.510
 so did and so I will say on the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.040
 account see link at greater than 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.419
 namely automatically switch to the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.090
 scientific notation 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.459
 so you will often have to deal with this 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.780
 so when to start calculating with large 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.760
 numbers 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.169
 imagine, for example, 3 to the power of six 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.630
 and twenty then you will see that you 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.980
 calculator gives the following result 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.410
 the time I would just check to 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.510
 suppose we have 3 decimal places in the first 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.959
 find a factor enough than we can 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.470
 this even further just down to 2.5 423 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.150
 decimal what real number what at 3 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.669
 comma and three to power six 20 real 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.260
 is that is the next number you see the 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.560
 That will also be your calculator here 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.040
 actually goes off 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.990
 today I also twice as a 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.180
 is not a sign but you have some waves 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.139
 it is not exactly that applied 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.560
 number 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.790
 however, the number is what is below it 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.620
 that it is important to know because 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.480
 scientific notation is of course possible 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.730
 often have a lot of decimal and one 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.430
 calculator often only gives eight 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.860
 nine decimal places and sometimes even b 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.160
 interested in 2 or 3 decimal places and the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.290
 you simply leave out the lesson automatically 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.580
 well this was just so the 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.900
 scientific place for the big one 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 numbers in the next video we go 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.160
 also shows how you are scientific 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.360
 applies notation to small number so me 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.360
 see you in the following video
