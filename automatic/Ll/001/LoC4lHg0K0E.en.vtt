 stress which increases the risk of accidents 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.019
 the use of health control of these drivers and what companies that 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.019
 can do to take care of the employee 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.689
 whoever rides the bus knows the story well 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.169
 collective note 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.240
 worse for the driver evolved as the ship 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.580
 so we have better conditioning more

 cancer 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 it's normal 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.150
 the professionals of the steering wheel are subjected to routine conditions of 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.870
 job 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.700
 in the degree of fatigue and stress so great that they often suffer from 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.930
 serious diseases 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.750
 Maria do Carmo 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.200
 two major accidents that happened last week ended up calling 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.010
 attention to the wise 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.680
 how the health of bus drivers walks in one of the accidents at the top of 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.090
 good view on the northbound driver who would have slept behind the wheel 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090
 hit the wall 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.960

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.910
 four people were hit by the driver who was pounding 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.810
 on the way to the hospital 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.510
 these images made by the camera of a cell phone 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.710
 shows the moment when the driver was going through 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.610
 the reasons for stress are many and the time to take care of health is little 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 tolerate having family to support more 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.830
 it's amazing 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.230
 very sad 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.150

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.270
 the driver's main owner and the stress 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.420

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.590
 this means that in about 30% 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 two cases of work accident

 ari the club denies all bus companies to have the control program 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.760
 medical and occupational 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.100
 certainly not only have the program 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.939
 coma has implemented alternative therapy to promote 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.079
 the relaxation of employees 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.049
 agencies have basically caused our needs 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.790
