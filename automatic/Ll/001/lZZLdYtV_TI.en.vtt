 healthy falafel are going to need 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.780
 in three cups of chickpeas that are 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.250
 raw but they are previously soaked 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.829
 I said it looking for the note 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.390
 above and in water with vinegar this is 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.620
 so that to eliminate the anti 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.809
 the nutrients that are present 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.510
 legumes after they then left 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.509
 the whole mind soaking in water the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.340
 They take out grandpa can they stick their tongue out 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.350
 they will also need half a cup of 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.940
 chickpea flour if they do not have the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.540
 line chickpeas can use flour 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.420
 wholemeal quinoa flour or some 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.250
 flour they have on hand 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:25.750
 they're going to need fresh coriander and salt 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.060
 sea garlic cumin and pepper 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.350
 then we'll be all 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 ingredients in the blender 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.310
 I'm going to use a teaspoon almost one 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.310
 teaspoon of pepper 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.450
 now 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.450
 and a teaspoon of cumin 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.399
 and I the only one I have in this minute 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.929
 It is a flower that is like 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.540
 dehydrated but if they have they can use 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.780
 garlic powder 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.780
 yes 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.239
 under dust and a teaspoon of salt 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.239
 sea ​​that's good 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.250
 let's try without water and flour this 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.630
 I should ideally do a 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.030
 food teacher because it's going to be 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.880
 easier but our processor is 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.310
 broke and we have not bought we are not going to 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.620
 try to do it here in the and be able to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.910
 is that this all that is good to die 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.910
 while more ground better 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.320
 now and I managed to explain it as much as 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.780
 I could with the blender this they have it 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.750
 leave about an hour for 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.750
 rest in the refrigerator and after 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.050
 that hour we are going to show you the next 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.050

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.130
 the mix was already an hour in the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.960
 refrigerator since before the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.190
 little balls that are falafel balls and 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.380

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.390

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.260
 of coconut olive oil or butter 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.260
