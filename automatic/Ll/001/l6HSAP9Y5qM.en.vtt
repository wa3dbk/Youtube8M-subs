 unboxing from the lego store in cologne yes like 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.750
 have already announced in cologne now 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.920

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.789

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.789
 corporate aliens 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.880
 I'll start now on the whole 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.930
 single stone next to the three 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 which of braunstein birth are those 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.059
 hold this twice twice and also the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:48.379
 double those are down in there then yes 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 I have such transparent 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.340
 Plates bought quite a lot so about 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 many and with that I want water now 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.230
 I did not want to build anymore 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.449
 with these little points 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.890
 careful but now time with 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.790
 such plates so I will at least 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 Let's see if it looks better 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.920
 then I have a lot of these 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.330
 namely brought so many and the stone 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.009
 I suppose probably stop around 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.900
 rings again or see what 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.900

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 then I have a lot of greens 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.409

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.259

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.240

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.880

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.720
 only part of this here so that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.000

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.890
 Gray will give more of them 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.930
 I would get some for myself 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.140
 but unfortunately I still have 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.750
 never seen in a lego store yes then 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.000

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.350
 but could use for maybe 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.530
 a star out of spaceship in fasting 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.450
 of it would still be spaceship 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.120
 I'll see if I need it but 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.080

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.770

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.590
 but I also have more and 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.870
 you could just build it that way 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:49.250
 transparent part here I bought 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.590

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.700
