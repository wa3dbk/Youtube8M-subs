00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.160
 ned 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.709
 faber 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.620
 in this video the 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.800
 how to read the caliper 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800
 The disc size is a precision measuring instrument 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.339
 You can open the caliper's mouth and this hospital 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.159
 With the mouth of the disc size you can adjust the thickness or diameter of something with it 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.699
 the ears of the disc size 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.540
 measuring around between and within sizes 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.500
 and the caliper tail is suitable for measuring diplomats 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.480
 the monthly distribution of the lower part of the mouth is called the necessary 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.920
 is 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.230
 on the lower half of the steel provinces the millimeter scale 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.270
 because the diameter of this little boy was a small to be measured in this way 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.270
 caliper mouth 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.300
 the first thing we look at is the dash of the zero of the 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.960
 home is 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.820
 I look at which line of millimeter scales has passed through 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.460
 the dash of part of the is necessary 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 in this case it is the six millimeter line 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
 you score others 6 coma 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.980
 now it is important to look at the numbers that the course should put 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.570
 because this is a writing error that measures exactly at one twentieth, that is two 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.510
 decimal places 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.840
 we are now looking for the two lines of the vernier and the millimeter 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.270
 scale this exactly in line with each other 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 in this case it is that the indent of the six of it is needed and the 30 in the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.150
 millimeter ashamed 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.440
 ing now notes the number of the no news that is the 6 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700
 the zero after the comma 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.790
 because you had to see the loom scored in 2d 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.700
 at this ready stand is the dash of a part of the no deal is 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 go exactly in line with the dash of the five millimeters 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.739
 you can check this by seeing if the line at this team's no 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.139
 deal is to be exactly a square for us with the millimeter mark above it 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.349
 the now scores a fifth before the comma and two zeros after the comma 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.150
 the zero of the nun 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.410
 Here the line of the sixteen of the millimeter scale has passed 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.429
 therefore the first sixteen coma 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:39.259
 we now look exactly at which lines of the no nice and the millimeter scale 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.889
 each other's extension 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.179
 then we see that this is the line between 6 and 7 of the melody 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.509
 and the 42 is in the mini meter scale 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.720
 ing then notes 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720
 65 behind the comma 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.009
 in brief 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.849
 the digit before the comma is the number of the mini with the scale that is 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.849
 passed through the zero line of the necessary 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.179
 the number after the comma 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.010
 is the number of the required 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.540
 that is under the two lines of a millimeter of sheep and it is necessary 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.400
 which together exactly 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.169
 a line for that 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.139
 like stabbing a part of the emergency services exactly on a whole 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:24.679
 millimeter 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.059
 note that number 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.059
 two lads 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.839
 6 behind it
