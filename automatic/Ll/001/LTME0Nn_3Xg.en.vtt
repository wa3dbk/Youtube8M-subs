00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.660
 the rights and protection of personal interests 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.249
 it can be that a student when you want 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.809
 robin to compensate her 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.959
 I'm still waiting for it many times for the other trillions of times 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.959
 that you gave me peace 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.289
 I am soon what is bothering me today is the people who steal bicycles 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.289
 they are stealing a bike but a piece of our independence 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.000
 Well yes you have to say that for Mexico last week now I have to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.790
 adapt to the grass not so that he loves me 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.480
 I regret very much your loss I have to be on line 3 and approved 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.879
 four bicycles this year 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.620
 let's go with the idea of ​​if you see at this moment 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.690
 there is no limit and 7 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.840
 lina 17 days before seen in the world 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.170
 hello my name is the king of sailing 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 and this whole thing about bike theft bothers me a lot 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.110
 that's why I want to work with david lr and form a resistance force to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.420
 take those bicycle thieves to justice 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.950
 who say rlr said that we call it free radio inquiries reveal will give us its 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.950
 phone number after but first we go with another call vitorio 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.820
 ahead 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.020
 he remembered that this afternoon 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 for its part 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.770
 has no presence in more than what they receive 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.440
 the criminal mind year of extinction 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.310
 same 1 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.310
 centralism at this moment I do not manifest 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.160
 let me tell you that 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.320
 I do not think so 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.729
 I'm not very photogenic you should see the photo of my passport almost do not deserve 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.780
 enter the country 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.420
 because I did not mean that if you were my passport 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 I'm not kidding, she's sure that in this matter 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.310
 lawyers and jurists better faces in the list of the most wanted thanks 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.210
 those tricks are fulfilled 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.560
 we have to celebrate 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 I already told you what I think 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 this time the bicycle eye thief envelopes 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.919
 We do not know 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.629
 to a bank 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.469
 we already know that we do not know 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.649
 eye 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.649
 this is done the union that thefts occurred 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:27.159
 most support in this area here except for these four that happened 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.159
 in the outskirts that statuette they are holding the map 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.979
 possibly indicates future dishes 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.409
 whatever 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.510
 since these robberies occurred in our neighborhood it is the correct assumption that one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.529
 of us is involved 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.099
 I wanted to be you 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.969
 8 upi 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.969
 or maybe it was you 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.269
 I was not I have an alibi 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.659
 tell him I was with you 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.049
 no no p 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.549
 do not pass up to me with you according to what I specifically referred to 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.989
 your 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.559
 but without evidence 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.209
 they are all suspicious 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 so let's keep our eyes open 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.579
 let's be careful many express cows 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.829
 Hahaha 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.709
 alcoa 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
 It can be a good talk 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.709
 finally I will do it well 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.569
 listening to him says he has good intentions but I can not help thinking 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.569
 that this will result in the two classics 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.730
 I'm sure the surprise team is a good idea 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.500
 davis said there were no autonomous birthday parties these are the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.090
 tradition the tradition that internally wants to make you more 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.729
 agile 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.049
 but maybe it's because your parties without offending tend to 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.789
 Despite 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:56.119
 are not extinct to the excellent with remember the party tore the 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.989
 spring or as we say now Salmonella Sunday at the New Year's party 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.929
 from last year 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.129
 so boring that we started the countdown the 8 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.129
 the point efe this will be difficult 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.569
 Also, I was about to read my primer 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.649
 the first three the expo comm 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.449
 toyota game 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.570
 now raymonda your friend painter and omisas now must pay to close the curtains 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.979
 turn off the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.999
 so carlos good 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:42.620
 will be victorious 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.789
 the man who thinks I can not catch him 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.389
 but think again the same I have his club but 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.969
 all and sure that mister unknown number is shaking in this 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.099
 instant 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.309
 to my son 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:55.539
 but pique 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.539
 you curse call blocking 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.330
 Rafa dwells his premises 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.819
 nor do you have the lights very well provided when they assault is in force 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.120

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:16.430

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.050
 unleavened high said fariñas unusual 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.110
 totally under these foreigners we understand the pastel candles now or 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.409
 after 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.270
 I think we never take that step, "he said. 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.210
 then then 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.169
 beyond and supposedly in the warehouse and 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.240
 you can not place yourself beyond very far from believing 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.930
 10 47 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.300
 in the corner and I would sing 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.949
 efe 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.789
 says the real madrid 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.559
 yes pd if you had the generosity to leave your bike without padlock outside 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.279
 so all we have to do is wait and date to stop the bad boy 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.770
 it is indefinite therefore the second black night 17 points 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.229
 limited and limited one eager lights off 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.460

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.960
 touch 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.680
 the fact that the father 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.669
 is 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.360
 the smell of another successful Roman party 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:49.349
 it's time for me to hit stolen bicycle
