gloves<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:45.890> probably<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.459> be

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
gloves so this is probably going to be

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.339 
gloves so this is probably going to be
last<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.090> might<00:03:47.269> actually<00:03:47.420> just<00:03:47.660> get<00:03:47.959> like<00:03:48.080> six

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
last I might actually just get like six

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.180 
last I might actually just get like six
percent<00:03:48.769> strength<00:03:49.069> on<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:50.930> yeah<00:03:51.290> it's

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
percent strength on it but yeah it's

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.250 
percent strength on it but yeah it's
pretty<00:03:52.879> good<00:03:53.000> I'm<00:03:53.420> trying<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.900> tyrant
