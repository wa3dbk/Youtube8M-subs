00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
over when these two played in the first

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.719 
over when these two played in the first
week<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.310> season<00:01:15.460> they<00:01:15.969> scored<00:01:16.270> 62<00:01:17.020> points

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.539 
but there was only 21 points scored at
halftime<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.240> then<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.780> floodgates<00:01:23.380> open<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
halftime and then the floodgates open so

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.580 
halftime and then the floodgates open so
I<00:01:24.579> think<00:01:24.939> you<00:01:25.240> know<00:01:25.359> that<00:01:25.659> there's<00:01:26.229> going<00:01:26.499> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
I think you know that there's going to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.029 
I think you know that there's going to
be<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:27.749> perception<00:01:28.749> that<00:01:29.409> they<00:01:29.740> were<00:01:29.799> able

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
be that perception that they were able

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.249 
be that perception that they were able
to<00:01:30.189> score<00:01:30.460> all<00:01:30.609> those<00:01:30.789> points<00:01:31.030> then<00:01:31.389> they

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
to score all those points then they

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.539 
to score all those points then they
should<00:01:32.469> be<00:01:32.499> able<00:01:32.679> to<00:01:32.829> score<00:01:33.009> all<00:01:33.130> those<00:01:33.280> points

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
should be able to score all those points

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.389 
should be able to score all those points

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
in New England and to me it looks like

in New England and to me it looks like
easy<00:02:26.010> money<00:02:26.370> as<00:02:26.879> far<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.300> an<00:02:27.480> undergoes<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
easy money as far as an undergoes and

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.460 
easy money as far as an undergoes and
it's<00:02:29.250> scary<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.000> play<00:02:30.180> under<00:02:30.660> with<00:02:31.349> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
Patriots specially at home where we

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.229 
Patriots specially at home where we
expect<00:02:34.140> them<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.440> score<00:02:34.680> 30<00:02:34.950> points<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:36.209> I

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
expect them to score 30 points but I

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.220 
expect them to score 30 points but I
don't<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:36.660> that's<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.050> happen

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
don't think that's going to happen

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.410 
don't think that's going to happen
especially<00:02:37.680> against<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.519> Miami<00:02:38.880> defense

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
especially against this Miami defense

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
especially against this Miami defense
and<00:02:39.690> Miami<00:02:40.410> may<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.860> nothing<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> play<00:02:41.549> for

defense of the first half you don't get

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.539

yeah

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.430 
yeah
only<00:04:23.130> for<00:04:23.880> Miami<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.660> talked<00:04:24.930> about<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
only for Miami and you talked about the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.800 
only for Miami and you talked about the
New<00:04:25.560> England<00:04:25.650> offense<00:04:26.240> there's<00:04:27.240> only<00:04:27.480> three

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
New England offense there's only three

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.000 
New England offense there's only three
and<00:04:27.900> three<00:04:28.080> against<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.440> spread<00:04:28.650> at<00:04:28.800> home

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
and three against the spread at home

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.400 
and three against the spread at home
they've<00:04:29.880> actually<00:04:30.090> performed<00:04:30.690> better<00:04:30.900> on<00:04:31.050> the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
they've actually performed better on the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.620 
they've actually performed better on the
road<00:04:31.440> offensively<00:04:32.220> three<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.210> three<00:04:33.270> against

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
road offensively three and three against

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.310 
road offensively three and three against
spread<00:04:33.930> home<00:04:34.110> scoring<00:04:34.560> 31<00:04:34.860> 34<00:04:35.700> 20<00:04:36.300> 20<00:04:36.780> 30<00:04:37.110> and

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
spread home scoring 31 34 20 20 30 and

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.860 
spread home scoring 31 34 20 20 30 and
35<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:38.400> they've<00:04:38.580> done<00:04:38.940> pretty<00:04:39.270> well<00:04:39.360> at<00:04:39.660> home

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
35 so they've done pretty well at home

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.170 
35 so they've done pretty well at home
but<00:04:40.200> they're<00:04:40.380> big<00:04:40.650> numbers<00:04:41.180> offensively

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
but they're big numbers offensively

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.720 
but they're big numbers offensively
you've<00:04:42.390> been<00:04:42.510> on<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.750> road<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.580> would<00:04:44.580> you

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
you've been on the road and would you

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.970 
you've been on the road and would you
think<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.150> knowing<00:04:45.780> Miami<00:04:46.380> is<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> better

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
think that knowing Miami is a better

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.130 
think that knowing Miami is a better
team<00:04:47.340> today<00:04:47.640> than<00:04:48.300> they<00:04:48.480> were<00:04:48.510> in<00:04:48.660> week<00:04:48.930> one

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
team today than they were in week one

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.480 
team today than they were in week one
much<00:04:49.740> better<00:04:49.980> does<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.280> make<00:04:50.460> sense

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
much better does that make sense

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.370 
much better does that make sense
entertainment<00:04:51.420> and<00:04:51.540> do<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:51.990> think<00:04:52.230> New

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
entertainment and do you think New

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.950 
entertainment and do you think New
England's<00:04:52.860> as<00:04:53.010> good<00:04:53.580> as<00:04:53.850> they<00:04:54.480> weren't<00:04:54.690> week

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
England's as good as they weren't week

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.530 
England's as good as they weren't week
one<00:04:55.230> or<00:04:55.410> maybe<00:04:55.620> even<00:04:56.090> improvement<00:04:57.090> or<00:04:57.180> decline

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
one or maybe even improvement or decline

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.540 
one or maybe even improvement or decline
I<00:04:57.750> actually<00:04:58.170> think<00:04:58.410> they're<00:04:59.190> pretty<00:04:59.430> much

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
I actually think they're pretty much

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.370 
I actually think they're pretty much
what<00:04:59.910> we<00:05:00.060> expected<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.660> defense<00:05:01.050> isn't<00:05:01.230> as

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
what we expected the defense isn't as

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.020 
what we expected the defense isn't as
good<00:05:01.530> as<00:05:01.590> what<00:05:01.800> we<00:05:01.920> thought<00:05:02.040> exactly<00:05:02.670> but<00:05:02.850> as<00:05:03.000> a

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
good as what we thought exactly but as a

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.720 
good as what we thought exactly but as a
whole<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.630> they're<00:05:03.900> on<00:05:04.020> par<00:05:04.320> on<00:05:04.710> par<00:05:04.950> exactly

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
whole and they're on par on par exactly

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.050 
whole and they're on par on par exactly
and<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.420> line<00:05:06.690> in<00:05:06.930> Miami<00:05:07.320> was<00:05:08.070> seven<00:05:08.550> went<00:05:08.910> to

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
and that line in Miami was seven went to

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.250 
and that line in Miami was seven went to
8i<00:05:09.300> believe<00:05:09.570> back<00:05:10.230> then<00:05:10.670> so<00:05:11.780> add<00:05:12.780> the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
8i believe back then so add the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.080 
8i believe back then so add the
home-field<00:05:13.590> advantage<00:05:14.250> Miami<00:05:14.610> as<00:05:14.730> one<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
home-field advantage Miami as one of the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.500 
home-field advantage Miami as one of the
weakest<00:05:15.510> home-field<00:05:15.990> advantages<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.820> this

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
weakest home-field advantages and this

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.440 
weakest home-field advantages and this
number<00:05:19.050> kind<00:05:19.830> of<00:05:19.950> is<00:05:20.070> in<00:05:20.250> line<00:05:20.520> with<00:05:20.850> that<00:05:21.000> game

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
number kind of is in line with that game

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.740 
number kind of is in line with that game
and<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:22.380> think<00:05:22.710> Miami's<00:05:23.220> vastly<00:05:24.030> improved<00:05:24.510> from

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
and I think Miami's vastly improved from

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.110 
and I think Miami's vastly improved from
week<00:05:24.990> one<00:05:25.260> so<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:25.860> have<00:05:26.100> to<00:05:26.250> agree<00:05:26.340> with<00:05:26.550> you<00:05:26.730> and

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
week one so I have to agree with you and

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.880 
week one so I have to agree with you and
I'm<00:05:27.420> not<00:05:27.600> surprised<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.590> know<00:05:28.710> the

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
I'm not surprised that you know the

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.260 
I'm not surprised that you know the
professional<00:05:29.460> betters<00:05:29.790> grab<00:05:30.090> the

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
professional betters grab the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.540 
professional betters grab the
double-digit<00:05:30.900> dog<00:05:31.140> immediately<00:05:31.920> when<00:05:32.430> this

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
double-digit dog immediately when this

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.330 
double-digit dog immediately when this
number<00:05:33.120> came<00:05:33.390> out<00:05:33.630> I'm<00:05:34.590> going<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.890> go<00:05:35.040> with<00:05:35.160> the

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
number came out I'm going to go with the

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.040 
number came out I'm going to go with the
under<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.820> know<00:05:35.880> I'm<00:05:36.240> going<00:05:36.420> to<00:05:36.480> look<00:05:36.660> looks

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
under you know I'm going to look looks

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.560 
under you know I'm going to look looks
long<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:37.950> hard<00:05:38.160> at<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.430> side<00:05:38.700> because<00:05:39.450> it

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
long and hard at the side because it

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.230 
long and hard at the side because it
makes<00:05:39.750> sense<00:05:40.050> if<00:05:40.380> I<00:05:40.620> see<00:05:40.890> it<00:05:41.040> if<00:05:41.460> going<00:05:41.940> under

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
makes sense if I see it if going under

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.270 
makes sense if I see it if going under
forty<00:05:42.510> eight<00:05:42.630> and<00:05:42.780> a<00:05:42.810> half<00:05:42.890> being<00:05:43.890> able<00:05:44.130> to<00:05:44.190> get

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
forty eight and a half being able to get

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.420 
forty eight and a half being able to get
plus<00:05:44.550> 10<00:05:45.500> sounds<00:05:46.500> good<00:05:46.680> as<00:05:46.830> well<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.190> sounds

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
plus 10 sounds good as well it sounds

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.370 
plus 10 sounds good as well it sounds
like<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.610> correlator<00:05:48.060> partly<00:05:48.510> exactly<00:05:48.990> like<00:05:49.170> if

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
like a correlator partly exactly like if

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.140 
like a correlator partly exactly like if
you<00:05:49.500> like<00:05:49.680> the<00:05:49.830> honor<00:05:49.980> you<00:05:50.340> like<00:05:50.520> Miami<00:05:50.850> if<00:05:51.060> you

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
you like the honor you like Miami if you

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.940 
you like the honor you like Miami if you
like<00:05:51.300> Miami<00:05:51.660> you<00:05:51.990> like<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.320> under<00:05:52.560> that's<00:05:52.740> how

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
like Miami you like the under that's how

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.060 
like Miami you like the under that's how
I<00:05:52.980> look<00:05:53.580> at<00:05:53.730> it<00:05:53.790> too<00:05:53.970> because<00:05:54.000> for<00:05:54.390> them<00:05:54.480> to

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
I look at it too because for them to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.590 
I look at it too because for them to
cover<00:05:56.070> I<00:05:56.190> think<00:05:56.490> they<00:05:56.580> have<00:05:56.760> that<00:05:56.790> not<00:05:57.300> getting

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
cover I think they have that not getting

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.360 
cover I think they have that not getting
a<00:05:57.660> shootout<00:05:58.050> they<00:05:58.560> have<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.890> have<00:05:58.920> success

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
a shootout they have to have success

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.520 
a shootout they have to have success
running<00:05:59.760> the<00:05:59.880> football<00:06:00.200> getting<00:06:01.200> them<00:06:01.350> out<00:06:01.380> of

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
running the football getting them out of

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.220 
running the football getting them out of
the<00:06:01.740> rhythm<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:03.000> I<00:06:03.030> I<00:06:03.210> think<00:06:03.900> that's<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.200> only

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
the rhythm so I I think that's the only

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.770 
the rhythm so I I think that's the only
way<00:06:04.530> to<00:06:04.590> go<00:06:04.890> i<00:06:04.920> think<00:06:05.220> this<00:06:05.310> is<00:06:05.370> has<00:06:05.970> correlated

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
way to go i think this is has correlated

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.650 
way to go i think this is has correlated
play<00:06:07.440> written<00:06:07.740> all<00:06:07.950> over<00:06:07.980> it<00:06:08.460> that's<00:06:09.090> my<00:06:09.330> best

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
play written all over it that's my best

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.130 
play written all over it that's my best
bet<00:06:09.960> for<00:06:09.990> this<00:06:10.290> week<00:06:10.560> under<00:06:10.890> in<00:06:11.810> Miami<00:06:12.810> New

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.110 
England I think this total may go up by
kickoff<00:06:16.590> once<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.220> public<00:06:17.580> gets<00:06:17.700> involved

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
kickoff once the public gets involved

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.260 
kickoff once the public gets involved
