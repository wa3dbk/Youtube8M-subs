now<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.559> i<00:00:46.649> want<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.860> go<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> camera<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.440> just

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
now if i want to go to the camera I just

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
now if i want to go to the camera I just
put<00:00:49.559> camera<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:50.820> going

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

i'm going to create a group to show

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.149 
i'm going to create a group to show
progress<00:01:34.500> i'm<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> drag<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.600> out

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
progress i'm just going to drag this out

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.350 
progress i'm just going to drag this out
again<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> roughly<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> middle<00:01:38.939> make

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
again put it roughly in the middle make

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.109 
again put it roughly in the middle make
the<00:01:39.540> group<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> bit<00:01:39.990> bigger<00:01:40.640> i'm<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> call

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the group a bit bigger i'm going to call

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
the group a bit bigger i'm going to call
this<00:01:42.540> group<00:01:43.939> progress<00:01:45.500> also<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:46.710> need

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
turn the visible off set their you value

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.980 
turn the visible off set their you value
of<00:01:52.950> group<00:01:53.689> progress<00:01:55.579> 20<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.820> reset<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> set

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
of group progress 20 so reset that set

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.399 
of group progress 20 so reset that set
the<00:01:58.170> layer<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.770> group<00:01:59.390> progress<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the layer of group progress to the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.100 
the layer of group progress to the
number<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.130> controls<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.390> layer<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
number of controls so layer it to be on

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.380 
number of controls so layer it to be on
top<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> everything<00:02:04.920> else<00:02:05.159> show<00:02:06.060> group

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
top of everything else show group

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.139 
top of everything else show group
progress<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:08.069> don't<00:02:08.190> layer<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> it'll<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
progress we don't layer it and it'll be

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.639 
progress we don't layer it and it'll be
underneath<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.690> image<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.470> took

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
underneath that image that we just took

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.910 
underneath that image that we just took
from<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> camera

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
from the camera

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.660 
from the camera
put<00:02:12.920> last<00:02:13.670> image<00:02:14.170> into<00:02:15.170> URL<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:16.040> URL<00:02:16.070> so

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
put last image into URL the URL so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.460 
put last image into URL the URL so
that's<00:02:16.820> what<00:02:16.970> does<00:02:17.120> our<00:02:17.270> ftp<00:02:17.720> upload<00:02:19.780> if<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's what does our ftp upload if the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.360 
that's what does our ftp upload if the
result<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.100> not<00:02:23.090> empty<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:24.620> enter<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
result is not empty then enter the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.960 
result is not empty then enter the
result<00:02:25.880> we've<00:02:26.150> had<00:02:26.240> some<00:02:26.480> sort<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.690> error<00:02:26.930> and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
result we've had some sort of error and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.420 
result we've had some sort of error and
hide<00:02:28.970> group<00:02:29.470> progress<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:33.050> then<00:02:33.710> finally<00:02:34.130> we

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
hide group progress and then finally we

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.990 
hide group progress and then finally we
just<00:02:34.550> need<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.760> show<00:02:34.940> progress<00:02:35.210> during<00:02:35.690> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
just need to show progress during the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.450 
just need to show progress during the
