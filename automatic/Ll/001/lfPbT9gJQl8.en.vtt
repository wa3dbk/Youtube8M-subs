University of Technology and last year I

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.540 
University of Technology and last year I
decided<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.540> try<00:00:23.810> my<00:00:24.170> English<00:00:24.800> math<00:00:25.160> course

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
decided to try my English math course

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.470 
decided to try my English math course
with<00:00:26.060> my<00:00:26.210> students

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.979 

I<00:00:31.680> think

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
I think

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.819 
I think
was<00:00:34.950> much<00:00:35.250> faster<00:00:35.640> than<00:00:36.090> traditional<00:00:36.379> horses

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.069 

had<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.540> individualized<00:00:42.540> approach

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
had a kind of individualized approach

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.030 
had a kind of individualized approach
and<00:00:43.970> it's<00:00:44.970> about<00:00:45.269> whites<00:00:45.629> children's<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.649> skip

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
and it's about whites children's to skip

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.340 
and it's about whites children's to skip
with<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.640> parts<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> material<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.290> they

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
with some parts of material that they

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.119 
with some parts of material that they
already<00:00:49.949> knew<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:51.000> understood<00:00:51.089> and<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.559> into

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
already knew and understood and get into

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.689 
already knew and understood and get into
areas<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.850> need<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.570> training

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.750 

I<00:01:00.730> feel<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.140> cause<00:01:02.440> was<00:01:02.829> combined<00:01:03.370> of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
I feel that the cause was combined of

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
I feel that the cause was combined of
many<00:01:04.659> elements<00:01:05.229> that<00:01:05.530> were<00:01:05.799> very<00:01:05.979> interactive

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
many elements that were very interactive

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.100 
many elements that were very interactive
there<00:01:07.780> were<00:01:07.960> very<00:01:08.320> interesting<00:01:09.270> Biagio<00:01:10.270> parts

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
there were very interesting Biagio parts

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
there were very interesting Biagio parts
and<00:01:11.380> videos<00:01:12.250> were<00:01:12.970> increases<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.130> those

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
and videos were increases and those

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.469 
and videos were increases and those
interactive<00:01:16.140> exercises<00:01:17.850> sir<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.090> was<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> lot

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
interactive exercises sir it was a lot

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.350 
interactive exercises sir it was a lot
of<00:01:19.509> fun<00:01:19.840> for<00:01:20.080> my<00:01:20.259> students<00:01:20.920> I<00:01:21.130> think<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:23.189> also

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of fun for my students I think and also

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.679 
of fun for my students I think and also
my<00:01:25.360> students<00:01:25.810> had<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.289> possibility<00:01:27.070> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
my students had the possibility to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.330 
my students had the possibility to
revisit<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.049> replay<00:01:29.860> sections<00:01:32.069> that<00:01:33.069> are

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
revisit and replay sections that are

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.330 
revisit and replay sections that are
training<00:01:34.080> which<00:01:35.080> might<00:01:35.440> not<00:01:35.649> have<00:01:35.710> been<00:01:35.979> clear

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
training which might not have been clear

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.539 
training which might not have been clear
at<00:01:36.759> fast

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.800 

in<00:01:43.970> fact<00:01:44.799> keeping<00:01:45.799> track<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.430> their<00:01:46.640> progress

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
in fact keeping track of their progress

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.350 
in fact keeping track of their progress
it<00:01:47.810> was<00:01:48.049> very<00:01:48.860> easy<00:01:49.159> for<00:01:49.369> me<00:01:50.240> as<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:51.439> could<00:01:52.360> do

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
it was very easy for me as I could do

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.410 
it was very easy for me as I could do
the<00:01:53.600> results<00:01:54.399> see<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.549> results<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.180> their

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
the results see the results of their

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.630 
the results see the results of their
tests<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:58.670> could<00:01:59.240> manage<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.350> scores<00:02:00.740> it

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
tests and I could manage the scores it

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.240 
tests and I could manage the scores it
was<00:02:01.759> very<00:02:01.970> easy<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.420> identify<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.350> areas<00:02:04.189> that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
was very easy to identify the areas that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.960 
was very easy to identify the areas that
needed<00:02:04.820> more<00:02:05.149> training<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.979> was<00:02:07.159> for

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
needed more training and it was for

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
needed more training and it was for
individual<00:02:08.899> students

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.760 

I<00:02:15.220> think<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.240> very<00:02:16.300> attractive<00:02:17.230> from<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
I think was very attractive from the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.920 
I think was very attractive from the
part<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.190> my<00:02:18.370> students<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.120> myself

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
part of my students and for myself

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.360 
part of my students and for myself
something<00:02:20.350> different<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:23.040> definitely<00:02:24.040> saved

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
something different it definitely saved

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.290 
something different it definitely saved
to<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.180> teacher<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.720> lot<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:26.080> time<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:27.300> I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
to be as a teacher a lot of time and I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.930 
to be as a teacher a lot of time and I
think<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:30.370> kind<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.820> course<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:32.520> for<00:02:33.520> wide

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
think this kind of course is for wide

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.080 
think this kind of course is for wide
range<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:35.140> more<00:02:35.500> natural<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:36.070> our<00:02:36.490> students

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
range it's more natural to our students

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:48.970 
range it's more natural to our students
to<00:02:37.420> use<00:02:37.840> digital<00:02:38.320> technology

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.250 

what<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.099> liked<00:02:50.370> about<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.260> automatic

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
what we liked about this was automatic

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.330 
what we liked about this was automatic
marking<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:54.840> were<00:02:55.049> there<00:02:55.830> was<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.010> lot<00:02:56.099> of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
marking there were there was a lot of

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.500 
marking there were there was a lot of
time<00:02:56.670> left<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.590> teaching<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> classroom

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
time left for teaching in the classroom

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.410 
time left for teaching in the classroom
so<00:03:00.510> my<00:03:01.409> students<00:03:02.040> could<00:03:02.519> do<00:03:02.730> activities<00:03:03.120> that

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
so my students could do activities that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.990 
so my students could do activities that
were<00:03:03.840> planned<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.799> book<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.280> did<00:03:05.549> quite<00:03:05.849> a

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
were planned in the book we did quite a

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.150 
were planned in the book we did quite a
lot<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.830> communication<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:07.980> classroom

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.230 

definitely<00:03:15.160> for<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.700> reasons<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.210> have

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
definitely for all the reasons I have

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.309
