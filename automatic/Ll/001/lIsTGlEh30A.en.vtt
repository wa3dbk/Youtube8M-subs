00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.319
 day let dear I looked today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 video 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.960
 Ruslan masks about affiliate programs 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.759
 and laid in my head here 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.859
 such here 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:20.730
 bad thoughts something that is here 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 ruslan says that guys there type go 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 here is this regatta there will be a bunch of you 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.660
 money there what are you sitting there nothing 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.550
 get though you can do the same 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:39.329
 but getting some money here can 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 there is a problem well, look in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.579
 Basically this is a trend I'm here right now 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.989
 notice on many such narrowly focused 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.789
 live channels 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.870
 that people only start shooting 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.420
 knives and try osheek their audience 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.910
 why is this happening i have those people 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.090
 who have tasted the partner who is there 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 and started getting some dividends there 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.430
 from the posts of his video he needs 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.130
 attract as much as possible 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.900
 subscribers see inspections getting 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.299
 as much as possible how to do it 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.869
 using narrowly focused content to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.950
 In general, there is no reason why if you notice 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.439
 on many channels 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.060
 began to happen and interesting herbs 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.930
 roses, that is, besides knives, they began there 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.290
 appear there bags there braised meat there still 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.110
 some things are not clear there kebabs and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.909
 and so on 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.040
 I did not understand indignation at first 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.700
 why it happens that is why there 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 the channel that worked there only 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.930
 reviews knives and start some kind of garbage and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.170
 slice 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.830
 do not shoot now I'm starting to understand 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.910
 why is it done then there is a man 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.039
 trying to cover as much as possible 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.900
 customers so let's say in customers quotes 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.440
 subscribers inspectors because the more 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.930
 so let's say in quotes of who's gas 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.100
 person who shows his video 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.640
 the more it seems to him 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.160
 break off if I may say so again 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.100
 look here 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.510
 live channel this is such a very 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.090
 specialized little thing actually 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.040
 that is, it seems to us that is, people in 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.760
 subject that it seems like there were so many 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.209
 the video there is a lot to see in 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.780
 mostly those who watch youtube it 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.110
 boys there teenager girls what 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.440
 Jean-Jacques looks unusual to watch everything 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.190
 until the end cool talking cats and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.330
 other 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.140
 d a day that is essentially that is 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.269
 ok make money go out there 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.209
 to an ordinary knife some boy 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.180
 earnings, I think it is very difficult 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.239
 again on my part of the person who 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.080
 not even affiliate 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.360
 such my speculations that on some knives 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.780
 and warm up without having some motive there 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.690
 if you stand there for something nick 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.900
 I think it is extremely difficult, that is, if I have 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.470
 would have been there say so already bag 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.560
 knives suit there I would have there 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.220
 what to shoot there and stuff stuff there 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.480
 if i don't have them i need to buy them 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.010
 so do not spend money again 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.910
 that is , you see a vicious circle 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.269
 it turns out 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.660
 and unfortunately it gets 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.540
 the tendency is for you to be there 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.900
 somehow stimulate 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.880
 your process there 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.400
 on remove this many videos this search 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.370
 you should have something interesting 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.920
 or some kind of ideological stimulation that is 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.820
 you like this thing you like it 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.000
 show people 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:16.930
 I do not know such a thing so public to the spokes they 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.080
 zm either make money on it but 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:25.180
 for this it turns out you need not narrowly 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.760
 specialize trying somehow 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.150
 expand your content that is except 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.080
 a certain topic there is something else to shoot 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:39.220
 by the way recently there metatron bullet topic 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.410
 about plagiarism and is divided in general, too, in 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.880
 this or that place in the world by participated 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:49.210
 cinnamon queen sacrifice why do u 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.760
 greece people plagiarize well 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.740
 I understand why 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.900
 thus they attract to themselves all 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.730
 more more subscribers that is 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.380
 let's say 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.740
 my content that I filmed there 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.070
 there they will see 300 people maximum 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.230
 there because I channel 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:13.030
 I said a learned video I have a little there 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.790
 the content is also so weak for the same 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.890
 the person who watched my videos and 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.050
 reshuffled at home 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.790
 he will receive there thousands of days a day 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.820
 in principle, I understand why they are 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.430
 do that is what they need 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.210
 hold afloat like 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.640
 You can get more subscribers 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.770
 as much as possible to yourself on smartov then 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.700
 have a single purpose or people like 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.880
 getting ready felt the taste of money this 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.169
 will be 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.910
 maximum attraction 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.270
 interest in your channel 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.210
 that is, for this they will need to shoot 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.610
 content is not necessarily alive at all about 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.090
 all that is all that faces than I see about 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.180
 the battle 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.509
 to drag yourself as much as possible 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.780
 the number of subscribers there that is 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.620
 let's say here I take off sales and took off 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.400
 let's say more 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.699
 fishing for example there I do not know there repairs 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.729
 cars there look roller there rzhaka 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:22.530
 watch everyone there as a cat walks like 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:26.039
 this dog there is fun jumping and what 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.169
 then it does not work here that is 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.210
 many newbies who see this 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.280
 what is happening that is they say well how 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.270
 so that 's what the metatron says 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:39.570
 what I want to do is nothing guys to do 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.120
 that is not the only way there 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.560
 somehow try to level the situation this 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.949
 shoot more video 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.070
 really to start 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:53.070
 some get the amount should be removed 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.289
 some kind of garbage some kind of prog that is 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.229
 some seals there I do not know there 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:04.020
 drunks there still like that is otherwise 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.800
 An ordinary mortal I think will be hard 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.780
 to catch 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:13.770
 but seeing how much he gets from his 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.729
 live themes there these two three pennies i 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:20.130
 I think soon will be disappointed and 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:23.130
 lose interest as affiliate and to 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.669
 what he does on the channel like this 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:30.930
 Here are my conclusions 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:33.020
 let's look and the evidence well and then all for now 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.020
 until
