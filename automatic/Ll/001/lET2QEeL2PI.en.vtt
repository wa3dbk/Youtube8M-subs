 in the spice department of any store and honey I 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.540

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.539
 try on a small site and better 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.110
 not even on the face anywhere in your arms 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:20.550

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.569
 By the way, well, the case is now often 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.640
 and I have now ended even one 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:35.819
 cinnamon stick i love the smell of cinnamon but 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.849
 I do not like it somewhere to be added here in 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.849
