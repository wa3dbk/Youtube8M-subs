00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hi then i am on the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.080
 handkerchief forgive me 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.740
 when you lose weight especially in 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 fast way the skin does not react not 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 it is equally responsive 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.960
 and therefore it happens that there is lost there 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.660
 excess skin then obviously believe that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 is almost normal when you reach there 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 they are lots and lots of pounds 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 I think excess is a normal thing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 you know I really took 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 a lot of weight during two pregnancies 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 in less than two years two in less than two 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.420
 two years Caesarean section then scar 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:53.820
 on scar and stretch marks of course 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.899
 in addition to al to the weight in short in in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 excess then what I did for it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.850
 which concerns stretch marks and I have it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.060
 showed in the past I used me 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 derma be there but it worked for me 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.790
 very much I used it both my sprint and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.010
 on the stretch marks than on 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.520
 scar see but it comes mainly 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.590
 like as a cream and then a gel is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.150
 absolutely transparent it dries 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 very quickly in the vast indeed 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 very little I have used constantly in the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.960
 six months after mine to the two 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.780
 share both parts and I must say that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.630
 like scars and scar 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.210
 obviously I won't show it to you though 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.880
 the result was really excellent e 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 also used also on 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.420
 stretch marks red stretch marks 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.110
 I repeat, the white ones are not there either 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.890
 tried because I think I have to be 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.780
 sincere 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.390
 I don't know it seems impossible to me with 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.049
 go away and or those stretch marks 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:08.269
 whites that I believe go back to mine 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:11.569
 adolescent period no hormones all 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.450
 I believe all these things to be 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.959
 may have been due if not to you 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.299
 have sprung up at that time 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.940
 in the adolescent period 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.459
 there is also the dermis that specifies for 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.590
 stretch marks plus a cream but not 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.970
 I know why I found myself constantly using 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.599
 those I found myself much better with 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.380
 that and with this here the white gel is 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.380
 was that I take it but the tube the 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.819
 white tube while that of 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.110
 that specific for stretch marks 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.579
 I have not found an equally well 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.190
 another product for scars 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.810
 this is not is not for stretch marks 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.010
 I did n't use it for stretch marks 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.739
 this is just specific pearls for the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.510
 scar the birth scar 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.900
 caesarean 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:07.060
 this is why it is called scorgo da 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:12.440
 a new sg 5 technology 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.850
 however, I have heard good things about it 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.880
 which are the things that are easy to 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.340
 use and fast I can dress immediately 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.660
 I don't have to waste so much time this is 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:28.730
 a to this toothbrush yes yes 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.660
 pass over the and this applicator which 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.610
 it passes over very easy over the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.940
 this scar too 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.060
 I used a great product from 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.640
 less then me derma then on 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.170
 medair but I can say absolutely 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.210
 I had a fantastic pregnancy 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.410
 a huge belly is i have to tell the truth 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:55.550
 I wouldn't have never thought of 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:59.240
 not even the slightest return 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.080
 anyway to have a belly between 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.490
 Quotation marks in quotation marks is normal 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.459
 so when I started doing the 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.530
 diet when I started doing 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.330
 physical exercise 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.459
 I must say that there have been moments in 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.410
 they said that there is nothing to do 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.140
 never gonna happen 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.620
 during the diet or always constantly 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.020
 absolutely done physical activity 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.830
 I think this was the thing that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:37.420
 allowed me to keep 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.590
 it is a good thun and tonicity another 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.830
 product that I've been seeing lately 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.650
 this is what I found very good 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.500
 I continue to use it and continue to use it 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.710
 every day this point for 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.090
 cellulite to maintain a certain 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:05:00.750
 elasticity and give a little more tone 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:05.500
 as always and only an adjuvant 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:09.910
 it is added to the diet e 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.160
 physical activity just effect slim that 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.200
 precisely this cream I believe that 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.180
 this is the third I use 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.430
 that the most important thing is to maintain 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.170
 hydrated skin hydrated because one 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.870
 hydrated skin and certainly more elite 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.040
 elastic and then lose the weight in 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.290
 gradually 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.210
 I recommend my deteriorate stick e 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:35.440
 anything 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.880
 we arrive in May and I have to lose 10 kg 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.470
 I recommend this is the most thing 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.530
 important is even more important 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.440
 let me always follow you by one 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.860
 person in leg a nutritionist in 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.650
 gabon behind a smart dietitian 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.020
 Judina 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.910
 and I'm happy anyway of 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.490
 to see that they are not a zucchini 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.460
 for me the main thing is precisely a 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.280
 to be fit to hear me hear 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.050
 strong and all the rest as mentioned above 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.460
 it's boredom 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.610
 and it's all as usual I hope 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.479
 this video was a great help 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.479
