00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
area and I decided to go to the very

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.520 
area and I decided to go to the very
edge<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.250> head<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.869> hair<00:01:07.260> and

edge of my head and take that hair and
measure<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> length<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.749 
length is and so here you see I'm
measuring<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.750> ten<00:01:40.079> inches<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:41.369> my<00:01:41.520> bang

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
measuring out at ten inches for my bang

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.179 
measuring out at ten inches for my bang
area<00:01:44.299> upon<00:01:45.299> me<00:01:45.509> doing<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:45.990> Flatiron<00:01:46.500> myself

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
area upon me doing this Flatiron myself

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.569 
area upon me doing this Flatiron myself
I<00:01:47.340> did<00:01:47.670> give<00:01:47.970> myself<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.780> slight<00:01:49.320> trim<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:50.310> all

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I did give myself a slight trim not all

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.170 
I did give myself a slight trim not all
over<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.049> places<00:01:52.829> where<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.100> felt<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.670> ends

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
over but in places where I felt my ends

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.039 
over but in places where I felt my ends
were<00:01:54.390> pretty<00:01:54.920> rough<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.570> needed<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.719> fresh

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
were pretty rough and needed a fresh

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.149 
were pretty rough and needed a fresh
trim<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.460> ended<00:01:59.790> up<00:01:59.939> cutting<00:02:00.390> off

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
trim on it and so I ended up cutting off

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.719 
trim on it and so I ended up cutting off
maybe<00:02:03.079> 5/8<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.259> an<00:02:04.409> inch<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> much<00:02:07.729> so

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
maybe 5/8 of an inch not that much so

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.930 
maybe 5/8 of an inch not that much so
here<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> am<00:02:09.149> measuring<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.080> right<00:02:10.470> side<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.069> my

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.160

hair<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:13.650> fell<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.820> don't<00:02:15.690> know<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.080> was

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
hair and it fell I don't know if it was

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.660 
hair and it fell I don't know if it was
like<00:02:16.440> three<00:02:17.130> inches<00:02:17.580> below<00:02:18.120> my<00:02:18.810> collarbone

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
like three inches below my collarbone

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.320 
like three inches below my collarbone
but<00:02:20.670> its<00:02:20.730> pretty<00:02:21.120> long<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:21.720> what<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.880> used<00:02:24.000> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
but its pretty long from what it used to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.300 
but its pretty long from what it used to
be<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.870> right<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.500> as<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.770> see<00:02:25.950> I'm

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
actually at ten and a half inches on

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.100 
actually at ten and a half inches on
that<00:02:30.450> side<00:02:30.750> now<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:34.760> don't<00:02:35.760> plan<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.540> wearing<00:02:36.810> my

throughout<00:02:40.310> my<00:02:41.480> challenge<00:02:42.920> will<00:02:43.920> see<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:45.450> just

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
throughout my challenge will see it just

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.660 
throughout my challenge will see it just
depends<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.500> pretty<00:02:46.920> much<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> no<00:02:47.370> Heat

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.720 
depends I'm pretty much a no Heat
natural<00:02:48.480> only<00:02:49.110> when<00:02:49.350> necessary<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.580> that's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
natural only when necessary and that's

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.180 
natural only when necessary and that's
like<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.000> said<00:02:51.240> what<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.510> doing<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.140> really<00:02:52.920> deep

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
like I said what I'm doing a really deep

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.710 
like I said what I'm doing a really deep
conditioned<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:53.940> hot<00:02:54.420> oil<00:02:54.660> treatment<00:02:55.640> now<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
conditioned or hot oil treatment now the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.410 
conditioned or hot oil treatment now the
left<00:02:58.470> side<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.770> my<00:02:58.890> hair<00:02:59.160> or<00:02:59.520> head<00:02:59.880> kind<00:03:00.330> of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
left side of my hair or head kind of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.500 
left side of my hair or head kind of
grows<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> little<00:03:01.260> bit<00:03:01.440> slower<00:03:02.280> than<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.180> other

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
grows a little bit slower than the other

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.930 
grows a little bit slower than the other
side<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.640> this<00:03:05.640> side<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:07.620> fell<00:03:08.010> right<00:03:08.430> at

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
side and this side here it fell right at

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.090 
side and this side here it fell right at
nine<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.960> half<00:03:09.990> inches<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:12.770> just<00:03:13.770> an<00:03:13.890> inch

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
nine and a half inches so just an inch

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.620 
nine and a half inches so just an inch
difference<00:03:14.520> on<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:16.320> two<00:03:16.560> sides<00:03:17.090> now<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.540> at

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
difference on the two sides now here at

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.590 
difference on the two sides now here at
my<00:03:18.780> crown<00:03:19.080> area<00:03:19.520> where<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.880> guys<00:03:21.060> see<00:03:21.450> me

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
my crown area where you guys see me

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.840 
my crown area where you guys see me
getting<00:03:21.959> ready<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.410> separate<00:03:22.890> an<00:03:23.040> angle<00:03:23.610> ahead

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
getting ready to separate an angle ahead

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.140 
getting ready to separate an angle ahead
and<00:03:23.970> measure<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.360> out<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.980> those<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.550> who

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and measure it out for those of you who

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.590 
and measure it out for those of you who
are<00:03:27.270> not<00:03:27.420> familiar<00:03:27.750> with<00:03:28.260> me<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.430> posted<00:03:30.330> some

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
are not familiar with me I posted some

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.800 
are not familiar with me I posted some
videos<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:31.470> while<00:03:32.190> ago<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.850> I've<00:03:33.090> since<00:03:33.330> taking

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
videos a while ago and I've since taking

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.620 
videos a while ago and I've since taking
those<00:03:33.959> down<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.730> my<00:03:35.730> crown<00:03:37.220> ironically<00:03:38.220> is

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
those down but my crown ironically is

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.229 
those down but my crown ironically is
actually<00:03:39.630> longer<00:03:39.959> than<00:03:40.380> any<00:03:40.709> other<00:03:41.250> section

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
actually longer than any other section

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.380 
actually longer than any other section
of<00:03:42.480> my<00:03:42.870> head<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.850> once<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.030> started

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
of my head and once I started

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.570 
of my head and once I started
transitioning<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.470> did<00:03:46.860> was<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.190> actually

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
transitioning what I did was I actually

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.810 
transitioning what I did was I actually
cut<00:03:49.040> every<00:03:51.470> inch<00:03:52.470> with<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.160> exception<00:03:53.700> of

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
cut every inch with the exception of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.330 
cut every inch with the exception of
maybe<00:03:54.540> an<00:03:54.780> inch<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.140> half<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.500> relaxed<00:03:56.070> hair

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
maybe an inch and a half of relaxed hair

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.210 
maybe an inch and a half of relaxed hair
off<00:03:56.550> of<00:03:56.820> my<00:03:57.000> crown<00:03:57.390> area<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.350> my<00:03:58.530> crown<00:03:58.800> area

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
off of my crown area so my crown area

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.550 
off of my crown area so my crown area
was<00:03:59.400> pretty<00:03:59.880> much<00:04:00.090> shorter<00:04:00.570> than<00:04:00.600> everything

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
was pretty much shorter than everything

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.110 
was pretty much shorter than everything
else<00:04:02.750> so<00:04:03.750> here<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.350> measuring<00:04:04.890> at<00:04:05.120> actually

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
else so here it is measuring at actually

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.150 
else so here it is measuring at actually
12<00:04:06.480> inches<00:04:06.870> or<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.080> little<00:04:07.380> bit<00:04:07.500> passed<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:08.040> me

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
12 inches or a little bit passed with me

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.259 
12 inches or a little bit passed with me
and<00:04:08.250> she's<00:04:08.340> something<00:04:08.550> she's<00:04:08.580> giving<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:08.970> 12

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
and she's something she's giving it 12

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.680 
and she's something she's giving it 12
inches<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.340> when<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.370> cut<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.880> crown<00:04:12.180> area<00:04:12.510> I

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
inches so when I cut that crown area I

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.900 
inches so when I cut that crown area I
think<00:04:13.050> my<00:04:13.140> crown<00:04:13.590> as<00:04:13.980> far<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.640> transition

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
think my crown as far as the transition

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.800 
think my crown as far as the transition
hair<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.590> new<00:04:16.830> growth<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.609> hair<00:04:18.120> was<00:04:18.480> about

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
hair the new growth that hair was about

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.680 
hair the new growth that hair was about
four<00:04:19.500> inches<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.520> then<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:20.940> had<00:04:21.239> like<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.479> said

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
four inches and then I had like I said

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.110 
four inches and then I had like I said
up<00:04:21.870> about<00:04:22.650> an<00:04:22.800> inch<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> half<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.610> relaxed

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
up about an inch and a half of relaxed

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.190 
up about an inch and a half of relaxed
hair<00:04:24.419> still

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200

attached<00:04:25.530> because<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:26.130> did<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.610> want<00:04:26.670> to

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
attached because I did not want to

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.370 
attached because I did not want to
separate<00:04:28.920> or<00:04:29.640> get<00:04:30.240> rid<00:04:30.450> of<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.990> demarcation

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
separate or get rid of the demarcation

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.330

line<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:33.540> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:33.900> just<00:04:34.200> see<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.560> growth<00:04:34.980> and

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
line and you can just see the growth and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.440 
line and you can just see the growth and
this<00:04:35.610> was<00:04:36.290> about<00:04:37.290> nine<00:04:37.560> months<00:04:37.800> ago<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:39.300> the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
inches as you see right there and I did

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.710 
inches as you see right there and I did

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
the ends of my hair as well because it

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.860 
the ends of my hair as well because it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
it just didn't feel right

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
didn't see too many split ends I could

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.050 
didn't see too many split ends I could
use<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> bit<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.330> trim<00:05:15.600> but<00:05:16.160> I'm<00:05:17.160> fine<00:05:17.580> for<00:05:17.850> now

and let's see I don't know can't really

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.159 
and let's see I don't know can't really
tell<00:06:44.410> I<00:06:44.880> should<00:06:45.880> have<00:06:46.000> stepped<00:06:46.539> forward<00:06:46.930> so

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
tell I should have stepped forward so

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.529 
tell I should have stepped forward so
I'm<00:06:47.289> out<00:06:47.500> there<00:06:47.530> I<00:06:47.740> go<00:06:47.979> and<00:06:48.310> you<00:06:49.030> can<00:06:49.210> see<00:06:49.389> it's

kind<00:06:49.960> of<00:06:50.050> hitting<00:06:50.259> the<00:06:50.440> third<00:06:50.650> line<00:06:51.030> which<00:06:52.030> is

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
kind of hitting the third line which is

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.930 
kind of hitting the third line which is
surprising<00:06:54.699> for<00:06:54.940> me<00:06:55.110> um<00:06:56.110> so<00:06:56.199> my<00:06:57.069> goal<00:06:57.370> I<00:06:57.789> would

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
surprising for me um so my goal I would

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.719 
surprising for me um so my goal I would
like<00:06:58.270> to<00:06:58.509> try<00:06:58.750> to<00:06:58.810> get<00:06:59.080> to<00:06:59.590> bra<00:06:59.949> strap<00:07:00.280> Linton

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.089 
like to try to get to bra strap Linton
but<00:07:01.060> I<00:07:01.090> don't<00:07:01.330> think<00:07:01.569> so<00:07:01.780> I<00:07:01.810> made<00:07:02.080> stop<00:07:02.500> with<00:07:02.860> or

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:03.099 
but I don't think so I made stop with or

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.330 
but I don't think so I made stop with or
reach<00:07:03.789> four<00:07:04.330> inches<00:07:04.930> before<00:07:05.199> bra<00:07:05.710> strap<00:07:06.039> lint

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
reach four inches before bra strap lint

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.620 
reach four inches before bra strap lint
but<00:07:06.610> that's<00:07:06.849> my<00:07:07.060> goal

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:07.630
