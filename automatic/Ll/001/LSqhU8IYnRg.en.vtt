make<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.159> tackle<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> Miss<00:01:47.759> he's<00:01:48.060> gone<00:01:48.270> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
make that tackle and Miss he's gone and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
make that tackle and Miss he's gone and
i<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.439> not<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.100> happen

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.560 

another<00:01:54.640> great<00:01:54.790> thing<00:01:54.939> about<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.240> computer

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
another great thing about the computer

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.969 
another great thing about the computer
is<00:01:55.720> they<00:01:56.110> pumped<00:01:56.439> on<00:01:56.530> fourth-and-inches

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
is they pumped on fourth-and-inches

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.410 
is they pumped on fourth-and-inches
where<00:01:57.460> your<00:01:57.700> opponent's<00:01:58.119> going<00:01:58.240> to<00:01:58.299> do<00:01:58.390> a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
where your opponent's going to do a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.539 
where your opponent's going to do a
halfback<00:01:58.600> dive<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.170> pick<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.409> up<00:01:59.549> they're

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
halfback dive and pick it up they're

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.010 
halfback dive and pick it up they're
going<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.790> punt<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.060> away<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.600> use<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.930> to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
going to punt it away so use that to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.380 
going to punt it away so use that to
your<00:02:02.110> advantage<00:02:02.170> obviously<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.270> can

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
your advantage obviously and if you can

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.090 
your advantage obviously and if you can
just<00:02:04.420> get<00:02:04.630> one<00:02:04.780> stop<00:02:05.020> you're<00:02:05.829> going<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.009> win

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
just get one stop you're going to win

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.419 
just get one stop you're going to win
the<00:02:06.220> game<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.319> see<00:02:08.470> sharp<00:02:08.739> open<00:02:09.009> every

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
the game so you see sharp open every

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.100 
the game so you see sharp open every
single<00:02:09.819> time<00:02:10.000> because<00:02:10.300> unlike<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.630> human<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
single time because unlike a human the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.540 
single time because unlike a human the
computer<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.530> not<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.950> adapt<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.459> this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
computer is not going to adapt to this

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.699 
computer is not going to adapt to this
play<00:02:12.790> they<00:02:13.200> don't<00:02:14.200> care<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.560> you've<00:02:14.680> thrown

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
play they don't care that you've thrown

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.170 
play they don't care that you've thrown
it<00:02:15.069> ten<00:02:15.250> times<00:02:15.430> before<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.910> you're<00:02:16.060> not

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
it ten times before this you're not

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.250 
it ten times before this you're not
going<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.390> put<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.540> guy<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.989> they're<00:02:17.140> not

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
going to put a guy on I'm they're not

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.170 
going to put a guy on I'm they're not
going<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.470> grab<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.800> de<00:02:17.950> back<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.580> dark

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
going to grab the de back and a dark

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.120 
going to grab the de back and a dark
blue<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.690> cover<00:02:19.900> him<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.769> going<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.010> keep

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
blue to cover him it's going to keep

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.699 
blue to cover him it's going to keep
letting<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.430> throw<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:23.290> actually

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
letting you throw it and it's actually

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.449 
letting you throw it and it's actually
really<00:02:23.920> effective<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.610> see<00:02:24.730> right<00:02:24.760> here

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.830 

so<00:02:30.459> after<00:02:30.580> about<00:02:30.700> five<00:02:30.970> six<00:02:31.150> passes<00:02:31.600> there<00:02:31.750> we

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
so after about five six passes there we

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.670 
so after about five six passes there we
go<00:02:31.989> we're<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.830> end<00:02:32.950> zone<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:33.790> resistance

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
go we're in the end zone no resistance

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.930 
go we're in the end zone no resistance
not<00:02:35.680> really<00:02:35.980> at<00:02:36.100> risk<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.580> getting

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
not really at risk of getting

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.000 
not really at risk of getting
intercepted<00:02:37.269> I'm<00:02:37.870> not<00:02:38.650> too<00:02:38.769> sure<00:02:38.860> your

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
intercepted I'm not too sure your

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.350 
intercepted I'm not too sure your
defense<00:02:39.519> from<00:02:39.640> here<00:02:39.819> on<00:02:39.910> out<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.209> doesn't

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
defense from here on out it doesn't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.559 
defense from here on out it doesn't
matter<00:02:40.680> I'm<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.890> showing<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.330> how<00:02:43.330> often

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
matter I'm just showing you how often

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.750 
matter I'm just showing you how often
this<00:02:43.870> works<00:02:44.130> what<00:02:45.130> we're<00:02:45.280> doing<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:45.580> I'm

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
this works what we're doing is I'm

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.990 
this works what we're doing is I'm
picking<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.150> play<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.540> strong<00:02:47.459> twin<00:02:48.459> flex<00:02:48.819> I

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
picking a play and strong twin flex I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.400 
picking a play and strong twin flex I
believe<00:02:49.269> in<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.540> Panthers<00:02:49.870> playbook<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:50.319> you

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
believe in the Panthers playbook but you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.030 
believe in the Panthers playbook but you
can<00:02:50.530> do<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:50.950> out<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.400> anything<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.030> guess

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
can do this just out of anything I guess

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.979 
can do this just out of anything I guess
just<00:02:54.040> motioning<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.760> fullback<00:02:55.120> out<00:02:55.360> putting

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
just motioning that fullback out putting

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.220 
just motioning that fullback out putting
my<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> fade<00:02:56.440> route<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.269> he's<00:02:58.450> opening<00:02:58.959> up<00:02:59.079> that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
my to fade route so he's opening up that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.800 
my to fade route so he's opening up that
side<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.739> sharp<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.209> sharps<00:03:01.480> 100

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
side for sharp and then with sharps 100

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.110 
side for sharp and then with sharps 100
speed<00:03:02.049> with<00:03:02.290> my<00:03:02.380> boobs<00:03:02.820> you're<00:03:03.820> gonna<00:03:03.910> get<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
speed with my boobs you're gonna get a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.170 
speed with my boobs you're gonna get a
lot<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.299> these<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:06.549> momentum<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:07.000> your

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
lot of these and with momentum on your

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.500 
lot of these and with momentum on your
side<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.540> lot<00:03:07.630> easier<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.989> play<00:03:08.109> defense

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
side it's a lot easier to play defense

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.729 
side it's a lot easier to play defense
so<00:03:10.510> from<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:10.870> on<00:03:11.019> out<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.350> video<00:03:11.530> gets

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
so from here on out the video gets

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.900 
so from here on out the video gets
pretty<00:03:11.980> boring<00:03:12.130> because<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.609> just<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.790> whole

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
pretty boring because it's just a whole

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.009 
pretty boring because it's just a whole
bunch<00:03:12.940> of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.269> same<00:03:13.420> play<00:03:13.630> over<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.900> over

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
bunch of the same play over and over

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.620 
bunch of the same play over and over
again<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:15.670> you're<00:03:15.819> playing<00:03:16.299> this<00:03:16.450> way

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
again and if you're playing this way

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.979 
again and if you're playing this way
against<00:03:17.910> against<00:03:18.910> humans<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.569> can<00:03:19.750> see<00:03:19.870> how

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
against against humans I can see how

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.569 
against against humans I can see how
they're<00:03:20.140> going<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> get<00:03:20.380> mad<00:03:20.530> at<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.769> but

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
they're going to get mad at you but

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:22.650 
they're going to get mad at you but
against<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.819> computer<00:03:22.000> you're<00:03:22.329> just<00:03:22.510> playing

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
against the computer you're just playing

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.690 
against the computer you're just playing
to<00:03:22.840> win<00:03:22.959> here<00:03:23.290> I'm<00:03:23.829> just<00:03:24.010> demonstrating<00:03:24.670> that

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
to win here I'm just demonstrating that

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.530 
to win here I'm just demonstrating that
it<00:03:25.060> doesn't<00:03:25.420> take<00:03:25.569> skill<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:28.359> going<00:03:28.450> to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it doesn't take skill and just going to

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.030 
it doesn't take skill and just going to
read<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.840> inside<00:03:29.200> out<00:03:29.230> shoulder<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:29.920> most
