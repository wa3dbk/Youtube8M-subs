00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
exercises the school is studying how

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.480 
exercises the school is studying how
exercise<00:00:15.299> impacts<00:00:16.049> academic<00:00:16.740> performance<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
exercise impacts academic performance I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.370 
exercise impacts academic performance I
really<00:00:17.970> like<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:19.490> because<00:00:20.539> it's<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:22.020> blood

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
really like it because it's my blood

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.519 
really like it because it's my blood
flowing<00:00:23.130> gets<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.210> blood<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.600> my<00:00:24.689> brain<00:00:24.720> we're

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
flowing gets my blood to my brain we're

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
flowing gets my blood to my brain we're
trying<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.609> makes<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> kids<00:00:27.210> more

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
trying to see if it makes the kids more

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.790 
trying to see if it makes the kids more
willing<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.810> learn<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.109> more<00:00:28.439> focus

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
willing to learn and more focus

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
willing to learn and more focus
throughout<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> day<00:00:29.340> because<00:00:29.910> they're

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
throughout the day because they're

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
throughout the day because they're
sitting<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.720> lot<00:00:31.080> throughout<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> day

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
sitting there a lot throughout the day

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.080 
sitting there a lot throughout the day
and<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.219> makes<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.790> difficult

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and so it makes it a little difficult

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.000 
and so it makes it a little difficult
sometimes<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.809> keep<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.380> track<00:00:34.620> or

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
sometimes to keep them on track or

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.069 
sometimes to keep them on track or
paying<00:00:35.489> attention<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:36.960> up

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
paying attention and so when we get up

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
paying attention and so when we get up
into<00:00:37.260> these<00:00:37.380> exercises<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.190> three<00:00:38.460> times<00:00:38.670> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
into these exercises about three times a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.920 
into these exercises about three times a
day

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
day
they<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.469> sit<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.010> focus<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
they really sit down and they focus and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 
they really sit down and they focus and
they<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:41.850> back<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> work<00:00:42.300> all<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> the

at the end of the school year since
we've<00:01:01.140> been<00:01:01.410> doing<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:01.949> grades<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.579> been

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
we've been doing it my grades have been

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.090 
we've been doing it my grades have been
coming<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.359> why<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
coming up why do you think that is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.410 
coming up why do you think that is
because<00:01:05.939> I'm<00:01:06.380> exercising<00:01:07.430> during<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> day<00:01:08.909> if

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
because I'm exercising during the day if

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.730 
because I'm exercising during the day if
the<00:01:09.600> study<00:01:09.840> can<00:01:10.080> show<00:01:10.260> higher<00:01:10.500> academic

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the study can show higher academic

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
the study can show higher academic
achievement<00:01:11.610> exercise<00:01:12.180> could<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.750> seen<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
achievement exercise could be seen in a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
achievement exercise could be seen in a
whole<00:01:13.740> new<00:01:13.890> light<00:01:14.100> district-wide<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.330> great

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
whole new light district-wide a great

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.630 
whole new light district-wide a great
impact<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.250> goes<00:01:17.400> beyond

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
impact but I also think it goes beyond

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
impact but I also think it goes beyond
test<00:01:17.880> scores<00:01:18.240> we're<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.689> take<00:01:18.840> care<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
test scores we're here to take care of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.410 
test scores we're here to take care of
the<00:01:19.860> whole<00:01:20.009> child<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:21.060> our<00:01:21.150> kids<00:01:21.210> are

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the whole child so if our kids are

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.910 
the whole child so if our kids are
getting<00:01:21.509> healthy<00:01:21.930> or<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.170> they're<00:01:22.350> happy<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
getting healthy or if they're happy to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.999 
getting healthy or if they're happy to
be<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.610> they're<00:01:23.759> positive<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
be here if they're positive you know and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
be here if they're positive you know and
we're<00:01:26.430> taking<00:01:26.549> care<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.540> whole<00:01:27.720> self<00:01:27.990> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
we're taking care of the whole self I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.690 
we're taking care of the whole self I
think<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.920> says<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> lot<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.640> I

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
think that that that says a lot and I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.859 
think that that that says a lot and I
think<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.390> an<00:01:30.509> even<00:01:30.720> bigger

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
think that that can have an even bigger

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260 
think that that can have an even bigger
impact<00:01:31.310> because<00:01:32.310> test<00:01:32.880> scores<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.180> really

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
impact because test scores are really

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
impact because test scores are really
important<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.290> learning<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
important but you know learning and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
important but you know learning and
taking<00:01:35.040> care<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.640> whole<00:01:35.820> child<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
taking care of the whole child is the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
taking care of the whole child is the
most<00:01:36.630> important<00:01:36.990> thing<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> us<00:01:37.350> exercise<00:01:38.189> is
