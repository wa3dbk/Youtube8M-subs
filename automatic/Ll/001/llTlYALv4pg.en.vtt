that I know you could probably get a get
an<00:02:19.790> exacto<00:02:20.330> knife<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:24.730> maybe<00:02:25.730> cut<00:02:26.180> right

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
an exacto knife and just maybe cut right

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.710 
an exacto knife and just maybe cut right
there<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.140> then<00:02:28.130> peel<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.610> up<00:02:28.820> and<00:02:29.570> you

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
there and then peel that up and you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.960 
there and then peel that up and you
could<00:02:29.870> get<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.200> off<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.340> goes<00:02:31.489> around<00:02:31.730> to

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
could get that off but it goes around to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.120 
could get that off but it goes around to
the<00:02:32.000> back<00:02:32.090> too<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:32.959> if<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.170> do<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:33.500> you're

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.360 
that won't work you can believe it or
not<00:05:09.910> trying<00:05:10.330> eraser<00:05:10.690> that'll<00:05:11.050> work<00:05:11.139> if<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.310> do

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
not trying eraser that'll work if I do

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.089 
not trying eraser that'll work if I do
use<00:05:12.699> an<00:05:12.820> eraser<00:05:13.060> I<00:05:13.449> like<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:16.500> like<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.650> open<00:05:17.949> up

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
use an eraser I like to like to open up

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.380 
use an eraser I like to like to open up
the<00:05:18.490> game<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.240> have<00:05:19.750> this<00:05:19.870> little<00:05:20.610> bit

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
the game so I have this little bit

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.750 
the game so I have this little bit
and<00:05:22.480> I'll<00:05:22.600> undo<00:05:23.260> these<00:05:23.380> two<00:05:23.440> screws<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.610> then

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
and I'll undo these two screws and then

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.000 
and I'll undo these two screws and then
I<00:05:24.820> can<00:05:25.000> pop<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.510> back<00:05:25.660> off<00:05:25.930> and<00:05:26.320> get<00:05:26.920> the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
I can pop the back off and get the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.230 
I can pop the back off and get the
circuit<00:05:27.340> board<00:05:27.520> by<00:05:27.670> itself

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
circuit board by itself

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.550 
circuit board by itself
and<00:05:28.450> then<00:05:28.870> it<00:05:28.960> makes<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.260> a<00:05:29.290> little<00:05:29.380> easier

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
and then it makes it a little easier

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.640 
and then it makes it a little easier
using<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.310> eraser<00:05:30.700> on<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:31.090> but<00:05:31.810> they<00:05:32.530> both

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
using the eraser on it but they both

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.520 
using the eraser on it but they both
work<00:05:32.710> fine<00:05:33.190> they<00:05:33.400> don't<00:05:33.550> damage<00:05:33.730> it<00:05:34.090> but<00:05:34.870> yeah

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
work fine they don't damage it but yeah

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.260 
work fine they don't damage it but yeah
so<00:05:35.830> that's<00:05:35.950> how<00:05:36.130> I<00:05:36.160> clean<00:05:36.520> my<00:05:36.550> game<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.030> you<00:05:37.090> can

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
so that's how I clean my game so you can

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.360 
so that's how I clean my game so you can
get<00:05:37.420> them<00:05:37.540> from<00:05:38.200> conditions<00:05:40.860> conditions<00:05:41.860> like

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
get them from conditions conditions like

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.250 
get them from conditions conditions like
this<00:05:43.200> all<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.470> way<00:05:44.590> to<00:05:44.650> this<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:45.550> really<00:05:45.760> can

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
this all the way to this you really can

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.520 
this all the way to this you really can
if<00:05:47.800> you<00:05:48.010> have<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.610> label<00:05:49.450> on<00:05:49.870> the<00:05:49.930> back<00:05:50.080> that's

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
if you have a label on the back that's

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.920 
if you have a label on the back that's
torn<00:05:50.890> a<00:05:51.100> lot<00:05:51.910> of<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.090> times<00:05:52.300> if<00:05:52.630> I<00:05:52.780> have<00:05:52.810> a

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
torn a lot of the times if I have a

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.890 
torn a lot of the times if I have a
sports<00:05:53.290> game<00:05:53.500> that<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.010> don't<00:05:54.280> care<00:05:54.550> about<00:05:54.900> and

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
sports game that I don't care about and

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.150 
sports game that I don't care about and
it's<00:05:56.230> not<00:05:56.410> gonna<00:05:56.500> be<00:05:56.590> part<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:56.890> my<00:05:57.010> collection

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
it's not gonna be part of my collection

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.850 
it's not gonna be part of my collection
I'll<00:05:57.880> just<00:05:58.090> take<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.390> back<00:05:58.540> off<00:05:58.780> that<00:05:58.810> and<00:05:59.320> put

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
I'll just take the back off that and put

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.060 
I'll just take the back off that and put
it<00:05:59.950> on<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.190> back<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:01.450> know<00:06:01.570> a<00:06:02.070> force
