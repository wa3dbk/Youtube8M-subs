the<00:01:34.380> pulley<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> turn<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the pulley and turn them and then you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.179 
the pulley and turn them and then you
can<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.280> take<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.580> other<00:01:38.700> end<00:01:38.909> off<00:01:40.040> now<00:01:41.040> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can just take the other end off now that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.320 
can just take the other end off now that
we<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> pump<00:01:41.640> belt<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> way<00:01:42.180> we

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
we have the pump belt out of the way we

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.280 
we have the pump belt out of the way we
can<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> same<00:01:42.750> thing<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> drive

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and keep turning it till it comes off

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.399

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
on it's the same as taking it off you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.759 
on it's the same as taking it off you
want<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> hook<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.849> motor<00:02:27.000> pulley<00:02:27.209> and

want to hook it on the motor pulley and

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.729 
want to hook it on the motor pulley and
then<00:02:28.769> get<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.069> started<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:30.269> pump<00:02:30.480> pulley

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
then get it started on the pump pulley

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.710 
then get it started on the pump pulley
and<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:32.069> spin<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.150> goes<00:02:33.269> around<00:02:33.540> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and just spin it so it goes around it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.680 
and just spin it so it goes around it
goes<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.920> adjust<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> pump<00:02:35.519> belt<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.660> have

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
goes on to adjust the pump belt you have

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.420 
goes on to adjust the pump belt you have
to<00:02:36.930> squeeze<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.470> together<00:02:37.590> until<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.250> motor

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
to squeeze it together until the motor

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.869 
to squeeze it together until the motor
moves<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.280> want<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.610> is

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
moves up here so what you want to do is

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.479 
moves up here so what you want to do is
just<00:02:42.420> make<00:02:42.690> sure<00:02:42.840> your<00:02:42.989> motors<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:44.280> know<00:02:44.370> in

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
just make sure your motors you know in

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.140 
just make sure your motors you know in
the<00:02:44.610> back<00:02:44.879> position<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:48.000> can

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
the back position and then you can

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.539 
the back position and then you can
squeeze<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.629> it<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.950> when<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.040> start<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.430> feel

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
squeeze on it and when you start to feel

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.940 
squeeze on it and when you start to feel
this<00:02:50.760> motor<00:02:51.000> move<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.530> should<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
this motor move you should have a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
this motor move you should have a
quarter<00:02:53.459> inch<00:02:53.930> between<00:02:54.930> these<00:02:55.970> inside<00:02:56.970> belts

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.599 

because<00:03:00.720> ours<00:03:01.109> is<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> new<00:03:01.470> belt<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.549> to

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
because ours is a new belt it's going to

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.339 
because ours is a new belt it's going to
probably<00:03:02.760> going<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.420> little<00:03:04.109> bit<00:03:04.230> off

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
probably going to be a little bit off

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.349 
probably going to be a little bit off
from<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> old<00:03:04.799> adjustment<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.120> we're<00:03:06.269> going

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
from the old adjustment so we're going

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.979 
from the old adjustment so we're going
to<00:03:06.980> basically<00:03:07.980> right<00:03:08.160> there's<00:03:08.900> where<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
to basically right there's where the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.289 
to basically right there's where the
motor<00:03:10.200> starts<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> move<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.090> that's<00:03:12.090> about<00:03:12.180> a

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
motor starts to move and that's about a

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.460 
motor starts to move and that's about a
half<00:03:12.510> an<00:03:12.690> inch<00:03:13.579> so<00:03:14.579> what<00:03:14.700> we<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.030> do<00:03:15.150> is

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
half an inch so what we have to do is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.460 
half an inch so what we have to do is
take<00:03:16.470> our<00:03:16.590> 5/16<00:03:17.220> nut<00:03:17.370> driver<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:18.319> loosen<00:03:19.319> up

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
take our 5/16 nut driver and loosen up

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.300 
take our 5/16 nut driver and loosen up
these<00:03:19.890> screws<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.609> hold<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.030> pump<00:03:21.810> down<00:03:22.310> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
these screws that hold the pump down you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.470 
these screws that hold the pump down you
don't<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.609> take<00:03:23.790> them<00:03:23.910> out<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.269> loosen

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
don't have to take them out just loosen

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.979 
don't have to take them out just loosen
them<00:03:25.010> there's<00:03:26.010> three<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.340> them<00:03:32.329> to<00:03:33.329> tighten

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
them there's three of them to tighten

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.390 
them there's three of them to tighten
the<00:03:34.049> belt<00:03:34.200> we're<00:03:34.739> going<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:34.919> pull<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.340> way

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
the belt we're going to pull it this way

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.670 
the belt we're going to pull it this way
and<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.419> loosen<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.810> we're<00:03:37.200> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.349> push<00:03:37.560> it

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and to loosen it we're going to push it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.979 
and to loosen it we're going to push it
towards<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:37.980> motor<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:39.329> this<00:03:39.510> way<00:03:39.660> makes<00:03:39.870> it

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
towards the motor so this way makes it

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:50.710 
towards the motor so this way makes it
looser<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:41.430> way<00:03:41.579> makes<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.910> tighter

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.650 

so<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:51.960> tighten<00:03:52.230> down<00:03:52.260> one<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:52.800> screws

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
so we can tighten down one of the screws

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.970 
so we can tighten down one of the screws
and<00:03:54.660> we<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.810> make<00:03:55.110> sure<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> motor<00:03:55.740> is<00:03:55.860> all

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980
