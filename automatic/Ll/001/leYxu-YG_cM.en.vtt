00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.870 
really fascinated by like documentaries
like<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.500> kind<00:03:56.769> of<00:03:56.830> thing<00:03:57.100> murders<00:03:57.730> and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
like that kind of thing murders and

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.449 
like that kind of thing murders and
stuff<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.810> does<00:03:58.989> not<00:03:59.140> mean<00:03:59.350> i<00:03:59.620> think<00:04:00.160> it's

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
stuff this does not mean i think it's

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.340 
stuff this does not mean i think it's
okay<00:04:00.820> or<00:04:01.120> what<00:04:01.239> i<00:04:01.300> want<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.630> be<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.840> on<00:04:02.019> i<00:04:02.170> think

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
okay or what i want to be you on i think

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.070 
okay or what i want to be you on i think
what<00:04:02.620> they<00:04:02.739> do<00:04:02.800> is<00:04:02.980> appalling<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:04.450> at<00:04:04.870> the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
what they do is appalling but at the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.570 
what they do is appalling but at the
same<00:04:05.230> time<00:04:05.500> i<00:04:05.709> find<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.040> really<00:04:06.070> interesting

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
same time i find it really interesting

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.290 
same time i find it really interesting
to<00:04:07.390> think<00:04:07.480> how<00:04:07.750> their<00:04:07.959> mind<00:04:08.200> works<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.300> just

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
to think how their mind works and just

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.390 
to think how their mind works and just
what<00:04:10.780> could<00:04:11.019> possess<00:04:11.320> someone<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:12.010> do<00:04:12.130> such<00:04:12.370> a

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
what could possess someone to do such a

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
make sense and if I was smart I would

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.960 
make sense and if I was smart I would
