to show you a guitar arrangement because

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.780 
to show you a guitar arrangement because
I<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.320> song<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.429> played<00:00:14.639> on

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
I know the song I think is played on

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.689 
I know the song I think is played on
piano<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.750> let's<00:00:16.500> get<00:00:16.710> started<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
piano so let's get started I'm going to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.820 
piano so let's get started I'm going to
show<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:18.690> though<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> picking

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
show you first though the picking

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.679 
show you first though the picking
pattern<00:00:20.010> you're<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.789> I'm<00:00:21.510> actually

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
pattern you're going to use I'm actually

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.330 
pattern you're going to use I'm actually
going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> show<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.619> ways<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.189> this

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
going to show you two ways to do this

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.000 
going to show you two ways to do this
the<00:00:23.609> first<00:00:24.029> way<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.810> an<00:00:24.960> alternate<00:00:25.650> picking

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the first way is an alternate picking

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.730 
the first way is an alternate picking
pattern<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.180> these<00:00:27.750> three<00:00:28.050> strings<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> EA

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
pattern so on these three strings the EA

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.609 
pattern so on these three strings the EA
and<00:00:29.220> D<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.789> four<00:00:30.480> five<00:00:30.689> six<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.320> you're<00:00:31.439> number

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and D or four five six if you're number

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.250 
and D or four five six if you're number
minded<00:00:32.099> you're<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> go<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.329> up<00:00:33.660> down

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
minded you're going to go down up down

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.280 
minded you're going to go down up down
on<00:00:35.360> these<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.140> e<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.829> B<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.730> G<00:00:38.969> or

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
on these three the e the B and the G or

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.080 
on these three the e the B and the G or
one<00:00:40.290> two<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.739> three<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.640> up

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
one two and three you're going to go up

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.529 
one two and three you're going to go up
down<00:00:42.989> up<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.940> example<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.510> playing

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
down up so for example if you're playing

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
down up so for example if you're playing
a<00:00:45.930> G<00:00:46.620> chord<00:00:46.649> you're<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> play

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 

now<00:00:54.600> let's<00:00:54.960> say<00:00:55.109> you<00:00:55.170> were<00:00:55.289> playing<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.649> C<00:00:55.859> chord

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
now let's say you were playing a C chord

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.430 
now let's say you were playing a C chord
same<00:00:56.789> pattern<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.510> start<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> string

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.670 

or<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:03.060> is<00:01:03.360> modify<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
or what you could do is modify this so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.000 
or what you could do is modify this so
that<00:01:04.920> these<00:01:05.309> three<00:01:05.580> strings<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.240> EA<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> D

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
that these three strings the EA and D

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.719 
that these three strings the EA and D
will<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.670> down<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.860> then<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.310> e

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
will be down down down and then the e

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
will be down down down and then the e
first<00:01:12.450> string<00:01:12.810> second<00:01:13.650> string<00:01:13.680> third<00:01:13.860> string

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
first string second string third string

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.649 
first string second string third string
or<00:01:14.700> e<00:01:15.240> B<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.870> G<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.600> like<00:01:18.600> so

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.859 

and<00:01:24.200> again<00:01:24.409> modify<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.310> if<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:25.820> start<00:01:26.060> on<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
and again modify it if you start on the

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.280 
and again modify it if you start on the
fifth<00:01:27.110> string<00:01:27.350> or<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.619> string

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.320 

so<00:01:32.890> that's<00:01:33.070> really<00:01:33.520> kind<00:01:33.910> of<00:01:34.030> what<00:01:34.120> I'm<00:01:34.240> going

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
so that's really kind of what I'm going

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.090 
so that's really kind of what I'm going
to<00:01:34.420> be<00:01:34.510> doing<00:01:34.750> actually<00:01:35.440> it's<00:01:35.590> probably<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
to be doing actually it's probably the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.640 
to be doing actually it's probably the
second<00:01:36.910> way<00:01:37.030> over<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.690> first<00:01:37.930> way<00:01:38.170> but

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
second way over the first way but

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.740 
second way over the first way but
whatever<00:01:39.070> way<00:01:39.340> works<00:01:39.490> for<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.000> they're<00:01:40.540> both

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
whatever way works for you they're both

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.370 
whatever way works for you they're both
correct

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
correct

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.490 
correct
so<00:01:41.740> cords<00:01:42.700> we<00:01:42.880> need<00:01:43.120> for<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.450> intro<00:01:43.840> our<00:01:44.080> C

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
so cords we need for the intro our C

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.240 
so cords we need for the intro our C
major<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.420> three<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.260> open<00:01:47.920> one<00:01:48.070> and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
major which is three to open one and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.520 
major which is three to open one and
open<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.000> string<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.600> then<00:01:50.410> we're

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
open on the a string and then we're

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.630 
open on the a string and then we're
going<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:50.680> play<00:01:50.860> c7<00:01:51.690> we're<00:01:52.690> going<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.870> keep<00:01:53.200> our

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
going to play c7 we're going to keep our

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.340 
going to play c7 we're going to keep our
fingers<00:01:54.640> down<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.210> C<00:01:55.480> major<00:01:55.690> chord<00:01:56.140> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
fingers down on that C major chord and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.470 
fingers down on that C major chord and
just<00:01:56.560> add<00:01:56.770> our<00:01:56.800> pinky<00:01:57.370> on<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.520> third<00:01:57.880> fret<00:01:58.270> of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
just add our pinky on the third fret of

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.590 
just add our pinky on the third fret of
the<00:01:58.870> g<00:01:59.530> string<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:00.300> then<00:02:01.300> we're<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.540> to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
the g string and then we're going to

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.880 
the g string and then we're going to
play<00:02:01.810> F<00:02:02.050> major

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
play F major

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.880 
play F major
