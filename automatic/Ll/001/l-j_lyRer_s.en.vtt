and vines and very similar cousins of
the<00:03:02.220> plant<00:03:02.659> and<00:03:03.659> what<00:03:04.409> you've<00:03:04.590> what<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.129> was

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the plant and what you've what I was

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.020 
the plant and what you've what I was
saying<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> crop<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.419> past<00:03:06.659> here<00:03:07.939> so<00:03:08.939> you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
saying that the crop is past here so you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.729 
saying that the crop is past here so you
don't<00:03:09.120> expect<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.629> see<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:10.169> too<00:03:10.349> much<00:03:10.470> coffee

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739

don't expect to see see too much coffee
but<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.879> fact<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.359> won't<00:03:12.540> see<00:03:12.690> too<00:03:12.720> much

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
but the fact is you won't see too much

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
coffee anyway

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.460 
coffee anyway
because<00:03:14.909> this<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.479> plant<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.019> not<00:03:16.819> placed

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
because this this plant is not placed

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.610 
because this this plant is not placed
pruned<00:03:20.569> treated<00:03:21.569> in<00:03:21.690> any<00:03:21.840> way<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.409> really

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.610 

it's<00:03:34.050> it's<00:03:35.050> a<00:03:35.170> beautiful<00:03:35.320> thing<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
it's it's a beautiful thing and the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.390 
it's it's a beautiful thing and the
reality<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.370> though<00:03:39.610> is<00:03:39.790> that<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:42.220> most

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
reality of this though is that in most

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.760 
reality of this though is that in most
countries<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.480> can't<00:03:43.750> well<00:03:44.290> we'd<00:03:44.440> all<00:03:44.530> like

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
countries you can't well we'd all like

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.660 
countries you can't well we'd all like
to<00:03:44.890> have<00:03:44.980> our<00:03:45.100> coffee<00:03:45.280> produced<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.970> way<00:03:47.670> or

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
to have our coffee produced this way or

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.730 
to have our coffee produced this way or
come<00:03:48.880> from<00:03:49.090> such<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.420> natural<00:03:50.020> setting<00:03:50.500> you

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
come from such a natural setting you

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.310 
come from such a natural setting you
don't<00:03:50.770> have<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.280> fight<00:03:52.000> plant<00:03:52.480> diseases<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
don't have to fight plant diseases and

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.800 
don't have to fight plant diseases and
such<00:03:54.310> when<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.760> when<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> plant<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.480> really

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
such when that when the plant is really

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.630 
such when that when the plant is really
in<00:03:55.900> its<00:03:56.050> its<00:03:56.410> preferred<00:03:56.830> habitat<00:03:57.010> but<00:03:57.460> the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
in its its preferred habitat but the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.580 
in its its preferred habitat but the
problem<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.840> doesn't<00:03:59.140> produce<00:03:59.440> the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
problem is is this doesn't produce the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.410 
problem is is this doesn't produce the
volume<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.190> coffee<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.640> anyone<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.210> live

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
volume of coffee that anyone can live

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.810 
volume of coffee that anyone can live
off<00:04:01.570> of<00:04:01.710> so<00:04:02.710> they're<00:04:02.890> very<00:04:02.920> casual<00:04:03.490> about<00:04:03.550> the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
off of so they're very casual about the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.220 
off of so they're very casual about the
farming<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:07.510> works<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:08.080> this

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
farming and and that works in this

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.440 
farming and and that works in this
economy<00:04:08.640> but<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.790> doesn't<00:04:10.090> work<00:04:10.210> in<00:04:10.330> other

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
economy but it doesn't work in other

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.860 
economy but it doesn't work in other
places<00:04:10.540> where<00:04:10.990> land<00:04:11.230> values<00:04:11.710> and<00:04:11.950> labor<00:04:12.130> are

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
places where land values and labor are

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.420 
places where land values and labor are
or<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:14.050> completely<00:04:14.440> different<00:04:14.650> formula<00:04:15.250> for

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
or a completely different formula for

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.150 
or a completely different formula for
having<00:04:16.150> success<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:16.810> coffee<00:04:17.050> and<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.739> it

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
having success in coffee and it it

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.310 
having success in coffee and it it
hardly<00:04:18.580> works<00:04:18.790> here<00:04:19.090> honestly<00:04:19.390> but<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.170> is

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
hardly works here honestly but this is

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.260 
hardly works here honestly but this is
so<00:04:20.470> remote<00:04:20.800> it's<00:04:21.610> not<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.790> lot<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.030> competition

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
so remote it's not a lot of competition

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.070 
so remote it's not a lot of competition
in<00:04:22.780> this<00:04:22.930> area<00:04:23.110> for<00:04:23.440> coffee<00:04:23.680> with<00:04:24.030> privates
