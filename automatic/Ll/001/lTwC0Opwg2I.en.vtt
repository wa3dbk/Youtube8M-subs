00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
just to see how the concrete is poured

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.729 
just to see how the concrete is poured
in<00:00:52.480> there<00:00:52.630> and<00:00:52.810> how<00:00:52.930> it<00:00:52.960> works<00:00:53.290> we'll<00:00:53.560> have<00:00:53.710> a

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
in there and how it works we'll have a

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.250 
in there and how it works we'll have a
look<00:00:53.890> at<00:00:54.040> one<00:00:54.190> cut<00:00:54.489> open<00:00:54.970> on<00:00:55.360> this<00:00:55.720> slide<00:00:56.050> you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
look at one cut open on this slide you

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.780 
look at one cut open on this slide you
can<00:00:56.290> see<00:00:56.680> that<00:00:56.890> it's<00:00:57.040> got<00:00:57.220> that<00:00:57.280> sort<00:00:57.580> of<00:00:57.670> an

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
can see that it's got that sort of an

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.170 
can see that it's got that sort of an
alum<00:00:58.030> minimized<00:00:58.559> foil<00:00:59.559> on<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> inside<00:01:00.180> so

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
alum minimized foil on the inside so

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.860 
alum minimized foil on the inside so
that<00:01:01.210> stops<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.989> cardboard<00:01:02.680> from

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that stops the cardboard from

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.920 
that stops the cardboard from
disintegrating<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:06.010> it's<00:01:06.130> easy<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.490> cut<00:01:06.930> at

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930

you can see another way of doing a wall

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.460 
you can see another way of doing a wall
is<00:02:40.000> by<00:02:40.420> using<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:41.560> sort<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.510> again<00:02:43.510> battens<00:02:44.080> in

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
just to how the how they create a set of

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.770 
just to how the how they create a set of
steps<00:03:01.340> look<00:03:01.640> at<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.790> shuttering<00:03:02.210> they're<00:03:02.570> at

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
steps look at the shuttering they're at

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.750 
steps look at the shuttering they're at
different<00:03:02.810> heights<00:03:03.500> using<00:03:04.010> acro<00:03:04.280> props<00:03:04.520> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
battens to hold up boarding so they can

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.930 
battens to hold up boarding so they can
cast<00:03:08.030> some<00:03:08.270> concrete<00:03:08.840> with<00:03:09.940> submission

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
cast some concrete with submission

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.200 
cast some concrete with submission
obviously<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:11.990> have<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:13.220> risers<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.090> that

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
obviously they have the risers and that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.240 
obviously they have the risers and that
cutout<00:03:14.600> down<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.140> sides<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.680> that's<00:03:15.830> that's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
cutout down the sides and that's that's

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.580 
cutout down the sides and that's that's
finished<00:03:16.640> off<00:03:16.820> later<00:03:17.060> but<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:18.290> show<00:03:18.530> you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
finished off later but just to show you

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.530 
finished off later but just to show you
how<00:03:18.830> they<00:03:19.040> set<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.460> what<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.940> get<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.300> this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
how they set it what you get is this

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.070 
how they set it what you get is this
looking<00:03:21.290> at<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.530> next<00:03:21.740> slide

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.020 

you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.290 

now<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.420> can<00:03:31.600> see<00:03:31.870> they're<00:03:33.180> setting<00:03:34.180> that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
now you can see they're setting that

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.700 
now you can see they're setting that
area<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:34.960> what<00:03:35.110> they've<00:03:35.260> done<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:35.560> they're

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
area of so what they've done is they're

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.340 
area of so what they've done is they're
casting<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> bottom<00:03:36.700> part<00:03:36.940> first<00:03:37.240> then<00:03:38.110> the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
casting the bottom part first then the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.650 
casting the bottom part first then the
risers<00:03:38.860> will<00:03:39.070> go<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.550> with<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.000> correct<00:03:40.240> sort

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
risers will go in with the correct sort

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.770 
risers will go in with the correct sort
of<00:03:41.760> treads<00:03:42.760> etc<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.780> reinforcement

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
of treads etc to the reinforcement

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.960 
of treads etc to the reinforcement
underneath<00:03:47.370> there's<00:03:48.370> another<00:03:48.580> one<00:03:48.790> using

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
underneath there's another one using

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.270 
underneath there's another one using
tubes<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:50.430> create<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.640> base
