great now well you know we're really
proud<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.939> car<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:22.439> designed<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.039> at

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
proud of this car it we designed it at

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.420 
proud of this car it we designed it at
at<00:00:23.910> golfing<00:00:24.420> Auto<00:00:24.600> Sports<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.310> was

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
at golfing Auto Sports we it was

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609 
at golfing Auto Sports we it was
actually<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> project<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.510> finished<00:00:27.960> from

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
actually a project that we finished from

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.370 
actually a project that we finished from
metal<00:00:28.890> crafters<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.840> they<00:00:30.840> hadn't<00:00:31.199> quite

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
metal crafters and they hadn't quite

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
metal crafters and they hadn't quite
gotten<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> design<00:00:32.160> done<00:00:32.610> yet<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.120> had

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
gotten the design done yet but they had

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.330 
gotten the design done yet but they had
some<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> concept<00:00:34.200> or<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.649> ideas<00:00:35.070> there

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
some of the concept or the ideas there

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
some of the concept or the ideas there
so<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.090> one's<00:00:36.300> actually<00:00:36.540> all<00:00:37.170> aluminum<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so this one's actually all aluminum it's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
so this one's actually all aluminum it's
based<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> Ford<00:00:39.059> GT<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:40.100> really<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.280> we've

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
based on a Ford GT so really what we've

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
based on a Ford GT so really what we've
done<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.850> taken<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
done is taken the you know all the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
done is taken the you know all the
expertise<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.890> Ford<00:00:44.399> developed<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> GT

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
expertise that Ford developed in the GT

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
expertise that Ford developed in the GT
and<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:47.120> trying<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> say<00:00:48.809> what<00:00:49.170> what<00:00:49.530> could

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and really trying to say what what could

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560 
and really trying to say what what could
have<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> GT<00:00:50.309> Bennett<00:00:50.730> had<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> continued<00:00:51.449> its

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
have the GT Bennett had it continued its

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.500 
have the GT Bennett had it continued its
evolution<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:53.039> volt<00:00:53.340> both<00:00:53.610> performance<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
evolution in volt both performance and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.180 
evolution in volt both performance and
design<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.949> really<00:00:56.100> our

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
design and that was really our

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.470 
design and that was really our
inspiration<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.210> were<00:00:57.300> trying

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
inspiration that's what we were trying

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
inspiration that's what we were trying
to<00:00:57.570> achieve<00:00:57.870> by<00:00:58.140> by<00:00:58.559> doing<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.920> car<00:00:59.160> design

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
to achieve by by doing this car design

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.389 
to achieve by by doing this car design
wise<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> car<00:01:01.710> called<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:01.980> Shelby

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
wise there was a car called the Shelby

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
wise there was a car called the Shelby
gr<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.239> Ford<00:01:03.809> came<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
gr one that Ford came out with as a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.550 
gr one that Ford came out with as a
concept<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.510> about<00:01:06.600> almost<00:01:07.260> 5

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
concept and it's actually about almost 5

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.260 
concept and it's actually about almost 5
inches<00:01:07.590> wider<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.000> GT<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:11.130> has<00:01:11.430> instead<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
inches wider than a GT it has instead of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.170 
inches wider than a GT it has instead of
the<00:01:12.450> supercharger<00:01:13.820> twin-turbo<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.000> gets

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
the supercharger twin-turbo that gets

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
the supercharger twin-turbo that gets
just<00:01:15.630> over<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> thousand<00:01:16.290> horsepower<00:01:16.670> right

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
just over a thousand horsepower right

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.440 
just over a thousand horsepower right
now<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.560> forged<00:01:19.560> aluminum<00:01:20.280> wheels<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
now we forged aluminum wheels and a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.230 
now we forged aluminum wheels and a
carbon<00:01:22.080> carbon<00:01:22.350> braking<00:01:22.920> system<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:24.090> they

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
carbon carbon braking system which they

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.520 
carbon carbon braking system which they
use<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.900> f1<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.299> you<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
use like an f1 and you know not not the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
use like an f1 and you know not not the
best<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.040> stop-and-go<00:01:29.340> traffic<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.270> honest

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
best in stop-and-go traffic to be honest

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
best in stop-and-go traffic to be honest
but<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:30.990> high<00:01:31.110> speed<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.280> absolutely

yes well look at the welding on that I'm
guessing<00:01:56.310> stainless<00:01:56.909> organum<00:01:57.600> bo<00:01:57.869> did<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> all

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
guessing stainless organum bo did it all

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.249 
guessing stainless organum bo did it all
himself

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
himself

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.389 
himself
look<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.740> bead<00:02:02.250> Wow<00:02:03.350> just<00:02:04.399> thousand

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
look at this bead Wow just thousand

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.430 
look at this bead Wow just thousand
horsepower<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:07.079> over<00:02:07.320> right<00:02:07.530> now<00:02:07.710> we're

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
horsepower a little over right now we're

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.719 
horsepower a little over right now we're
working<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.890> development<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.700> think

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
working in development and I think

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.800 
working in development and I think
ultimately<00:02:11.370> will<00:02:12.370> will<00:02:12.790> get<00:02:13.060> about<00:02:13.240> 1,200

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
ultimately will will get about 1,200

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.120 
ultimately will will get about 1,200
horsepower<00:02:13.930> out<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.710> what<00:02:14.890> we're<00:02:14.980> trying

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
horsepower out of is what we're trying

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.890 
horsepower out of is what we're trying
to<00:02:15.250> achieve<00:02:15.550> now<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.970> was<00:02:16.240> actually<00:02:16.390> at<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
to achieve now I was actually at the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.710 
to achieve now I was actually at the
after<00:02:17.560> shop<00:02:17.830> not<00:02:18.070> too<00:02:18.250> long<00:02:18.400> ago<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.970> they<00:02:19.540> had

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
after shop not too long ago and they had

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.110 
after shop not too long ago and they had
this<00:02:20.020> up<00:02:20.230> on<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> lift<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.370> backend<00:02:21.580> part

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
this up on the lift and the backend part

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.210 
this up on the lift and the backend part
and<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.960> amount<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.320> work<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
and just the amount of work and the

yourself it it looks great interior the
interior<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:01.480> for<00:04:02.480> GT<00:04:03.020> but<00:04:03.320> it<00:04:03.470> has<00:04:03.740> many<00:04:04.340> other

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
interior is for GT but it has many other

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.890 
interior is for GT but it has many other
parts<00:04:05.600> on<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.840> than<00:04:06.410> just<00:04:06.550> again<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.600> if

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
parts on it than just again the the if

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.070 
parts on it than just again the the if
they<00:04:09.170> had<00:04:09.520> kept<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:10.670> program<00:04:10.850> alive<00:04:11.510> I<00:04:11.540> wish

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
they had kept the program alive I wish

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.220 
they had kept the program alive I wish
they<00:04:12.290> had<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:13.370> is<00:04:13.720> probably<00:04:14.720> where<00:04:15.050> they'd

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
they had this is probably where they'd

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.520 
they had this is probably where they'd
be<00:04:15.410> at<00:04:15.620> a<00:04:15.980> decade<00:04:16.760> on<00:04:17.030> maybe<00:04:17.540> not<00:04:17.630> like<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.110> or

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
be at a decade on maybe not like this or

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.340 
be at a decade on maybe not like this or
maybe<00:04:18.950> not<00:04:19.220> with<00:04:19.400> this<00:04:19.549> much<00:04:19.790> horsepower

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
maybe not with this much horsepower

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.010 
maybe not with this much horsepower
alright<00:04:21.350> so<00:04:22.040> but<00:04:22.730> where<00:04:23.000> do<00:04:23.090> people<00:04:23.120> go<00:04:23.570> if

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
alright so but where do people go if

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.060 
alright so but where do people go if
they<00:04:24.080> want<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.620> check<00:04:25.490> out<00:04:25.670> all<00:04:26.060> things<00:04:26.330> Galvin
