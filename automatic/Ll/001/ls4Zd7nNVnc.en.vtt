are<00:00:41.250> smaller<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.440> they're<00:00:43.559> just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
are smaller and I think they're just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
are smaller and I think they're just
basically<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> waste<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.700> money<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.170> to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.569 
going to show you guys how to use the
sink<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.500> basically<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
sink so basically what you do is just

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
sink so basically what you do is just
pull<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.149> thing<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:04.439> stack<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
pull this thing up and they stack a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.580 
pull this thing up and they stack a
simply<00:02:05.399> close<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.299> bit<00:02:06.479> water

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
simply close it up a little bit water

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
simply close it up a little bit water
and<00:02:08.280> make<00:02:08.429> sure<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.729> water<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.270> too<00:02:09.330> deep

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and make sure the water is not too deep

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.949 
and make sure the water is not too deep
because<00:02:10.020> your<00:02:10.289> birds<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.649> get<00:02:10.830> scared<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.550> a
