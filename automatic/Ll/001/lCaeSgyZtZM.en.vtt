this<00:01:00.600> by<00:01:00.780> accident<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.559> went<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.340> store

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
this by accident I went into the store

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.820 
this by accident I went into the store
to<00:01:02.699> buy<00:01:02.730> something<00:01:03.090> else<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.409> shea<00:01:04.589> butter

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
to buy something else the shea butter

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
to buy something else the shea butter
and<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.820> sold<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.240> or<00:01:06.630> whatever

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and it actually was sold out or whatever

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920 
and it actually was sold out or whatever
they<00:01:07.380> didn't<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:09.119> product<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they didn't have it so this product it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
they didn't have it so this product it's
kind<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> weird<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.040> does<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.630> mineral

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
kind of weird like it does have mineral

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.830 
kind of weird like it does have mineral
oil<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.790> for<00:01:14.790> me<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
oil in it but for me like if it's in the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
oil in it but for me like if it's in the
first<00:01:16.080> five<00:01:16.229> ingredients<00:01:16.710> I'll<00:01:16.830> avoid<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
first five ingredients I'll avoid the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.300 
first five ingredients I'll avoid the
product<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.590> neither

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
product but this is actually in neither

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.969 
product but this is actually in neither
so<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.259> another<00:01:22.530> thing<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.770 
I mentioned before so with that I would
just<00:01:47.640> say<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.060> careful<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
just say just be careful because if the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
just say just be careful because if the

other products are using also it's heavy
and<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> protein<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.320> noticed<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.890> with

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and like the protein I noticed that with

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700 
and like the protein I noticed that with
my<00:01:53.670> hair<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.119> couple<00:01:54.689> weeks<00:01:55.020> ago<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.380> did<00:01:55.680> a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
couple of months or so but I did it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.280 
couple of months or so but I did it

recently and then I noticed that some of

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.050 
recently and then I noticed that some of
the<00:02:04.439> other<00:02:04.649> products<00:02:05.130> i<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.430> using<00:02:05.640> with<00:02:05.880> some

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the other products i was using with some

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
the other products i was using with some
of<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.180> oils<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.840> i<00:02:06.990> used<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> jobo<00:02:07.649> oil<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
like this also has protein in it so

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.630

bringing<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.690> up<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.620> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
bringing that up to you so that you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.800 
bringing that up to you so that you
could<00:02:18.040> be<00:02:18.130> aware<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.670> your<00:02:19.120> hair<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.390> drying

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
out that could be the reason another

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.120 
out that could be the reason another
thing<00:02:22.569> is<00:02:22.690> they<00:02:23.020> suggest<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.830> add
