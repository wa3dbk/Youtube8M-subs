00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.410

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.700
 brew news 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.250

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.179
 have jewish ao 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.789
 from such a product 2 hours normal bots 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.939
 standard and launched to our 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.699
 fleets and for other projects it became 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.919
 curious what will happen if you are ready among 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.300
 they are always talking to each other 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.939
 another place 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.819
 everyone knows that the robot is not my name is roll 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:32.570
 of works 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.190
 EU and two years produced a factory 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.950
 recycling i'm a robot yes i know units 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.780
 but 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 however due to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.460
 developing this online hour per year 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 which are built with all past 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.900
 dialogue with users 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.940
 especially on this city since 1997 and for that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.570
 time talked with people in my 65 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 million times 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520
 it is not put expected metropolitan 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.930
 City Hall during these conversations he remembers 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 what people want to say 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.720
 we assume that when people are online 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.100
 communicate with the child then 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 they have quite a foolish page 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.720
 rehabilitation 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 then the balance numbers of the new robot no i don't 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 robots i'm a unicorn but you said you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.270
 work at the airport 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.400
 No, I did not speak, but I think we speak. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.440
 afraid of what's strange you should not 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.550
 be memory problems I responded to 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.290
 all your questions 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.480
 good game she forgave it can 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.730
 to be a nation like Alice through the looking glass 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.860
 alice meets unicorn him were 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.930
 amazed because never each other 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.490
 have seen the person they agree if 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.910
 you will believe in me i will believe in myself 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.000
 if you are sure 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.120
 let's do something for you god is not all on 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.420
 light not everything can mean that like this 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.120
 for example, not everyone can be someone of the year 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.910
 and if all the same that it therefore 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.610
 doubt he 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.810
 long noticed then would like to believe 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.830
 and you believe in god when the tree ensign 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.570
 it does not apply 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.120
 they speak at random abodi topic 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.140
 or unicorns and because people here 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 so say recession worked more cautiously 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.429
 yourself 20 as a result chada bots get used to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.670
 the fact that this is communication learns 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.310
 talk to people like that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.970
 this figure is less paradox but 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.849
 that's why they seem to be enough 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.309
 animated 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.729
 it means the peasants do not like 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:22.769
 but you say it helps and are tuned 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.069
 mean and thorn ha ha you say about min it 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.219
 general rubbish and you do not even want 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.889
 deal of course man 2
