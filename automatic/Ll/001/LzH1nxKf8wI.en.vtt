sound and you just hate to destroy that
symbol<00:01:06.810> let's<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
symbol let's get it back up there in the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.899 
symbol let's get it back up there in the
marketplace<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:09.689> part<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.890> SR<00:01:11.670> 2

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
marketplace the first part of the SR 2

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.490 
marketplace the first part of the SR 2
is<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.390> remove<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
is to remove it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590 
is to remove it
shifting<00:01:13.830> logos<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.760> were<00:01:14.910> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> symbol

shifting logos that were on the symbol

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.040 
shifting logos that were on the symbol
then<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> take<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> knife<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.660> over

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
then it is to take a knife and go over

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.320 
then it is to take a knife and go over
the<00:01:19.320> symbol<00:01:19.680> i<00:01:19.800> gain<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> take<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.670> any<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.180> the

the symbol i gain to take out any of the
previously<00:01:21.930> thing<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.620> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> symbol

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
previously thing that was on the symbol

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700 
previously thing that was on the symbol
and<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> next<00:01:24.600> step<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> sr2

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and this is the next step of the sr2

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.750 
and this is the next step of the sr2
process<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.790> sorry<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.750> can't<00:01:27.990> show<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.260> that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.270 

time<00:01:32.760> to<00:01:32.940> test<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.330> sr2<00:01:33.780> simply<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
time to test the sr2 simply we have a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
time to test the sr2 simply we have a
current<00:01:35.910> load<00:01:36.060> selected<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> various<00:01:36.930> sizes

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
current load selected of various sizes

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.620 
current load selected of various sizes
they've<00:01:38.100> gone<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.700> process<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.479> now

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
they've gone through the process and now

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
they've gone through the process and now
we've<00:01:39.869> got<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.170> decide<00:01:40.440> whether<00:01:40.650> they're<00:01:40.950> good

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
we've got to decide whether they're good

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:51.890 
we've got to decide whether they're good
enough<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.700> make<00:01:41.790> SR<00:01:42.180> 2

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.170 

way<00:01:52.900> we<00:01:53.080> name<00:01:53.320> sr2<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.310> opposed<00:01:54.610> with<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.090> way

way we name sr2 as opposed with the way
we<00:01:55.299> normally<00:01:55.479> would<00:01:55.810> name<00:01:55.990> symbols<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:56.500> only

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
we normally would name symbols is only

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.100 
we normally would name symbols is only
by<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.190> weight<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> signal<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.869> size
