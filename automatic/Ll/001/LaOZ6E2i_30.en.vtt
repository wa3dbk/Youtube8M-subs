talk to the shy girls up

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.969 
talk to the shy girls up
right<00:01:59.610> now<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.570> introverts<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.320> far<00:02:01.500> as<00:02:01.680> what

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
right now the introverts as far as what

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
right now the introverts as far as what
they<00:02:02.369> can<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> talk<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.240> guy<00:02:03.899> that

they can do to talk to that guy that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
they can do to talk to that guy that

they've always wanted to talk to well I

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.429 
they've always wanted to talk to well I
think<00:02:06.149> there's<00:02:06.509> two<00:02:06.570> different<00:02:07.049> ways<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> go

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
think there's two different ways to go

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.410 
think there's two different ways to go
about<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.890> one<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.729> subtle<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.270> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
about it and one is more subtle is that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.250 
about it and one is more subtle is that
you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.750> make<00:02:09.869> eye<00:02:10.050> contact<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> guy<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
you can make eye contact with a guy and

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.330 
you can make eye contact with a guy and
often<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.410> will<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.830> enough<00:02:14.130> for<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
often that will be just enough for the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.920 
often that will be just enough for the
guy<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> approach<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.420> he'll<00:02:15.690> still

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
guy to approach you and he'll still

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.540 
guy to approach you and he'll still
think<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.410> he<00:02:16.560> did<00:02:16.709> all<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.040> approaching

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
think that he did all of the approaching

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
think that he did all of the approaching
because<00:02:18.090> he's<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.480> who<00:02:18.599> actually<00:02:18.630> walked

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
because he's the one who actually walked

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.500 
because he's the one who actually walked
over<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.620> talked<00:02:19.890> even<00:02:20.640> though<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.880> gave<00:02:21.360> him

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
over and talked even though you gave him

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.770 
over and talked even though you gave him
the<00:02:21.569> smile<00:02:21.840> first<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:23.400> other<00:02:23.550> way<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.849> go

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the smile first the other way to go

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.300 
the smile first the other way to go
about<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.560> actually<00:02:25.769> do<00:02:26.099> want<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
about that if you actually do want to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.680 
about that if you actually do want to
start<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.610> conversation<00:02:26.790> with<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.330> guy<00:02:27.450> it's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
start a conversation with a guy it's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.960 
start a conversation with a guy it's
just<00:02:27.900> practice<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.590> practice<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.519> guys<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
just practice and practice on guys that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.610 
just practice and practice on guys that
you're<00:02:30.090> maybe<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.360> quite<00:02:30.840> as<00:02:31.080> interested<00:02:31.530> in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you're maybe not quite as interested in

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.530 
you're maybe not quite as interested in
so<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.519> as<00:02:32.700> worried<00:02:33.120> about<00:02:33.330> it

so that you're not as worried about it
and<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.720> say<00:02:33.900> oh<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:34.680> maybe<00:02:34.980> want<00:02:35.250> to

to him and see how it goes and you do

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.690 
to him and see how it goes and you do
that<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.019> couple<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.380> times<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.709> night<00:02:40.830> soon<00:02:41.489> it's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
that a couple of times a night soon it's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.250 
that a couple of times a night soon it's
really<00:02:42.030> easy<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.660> are<00:02:42.750> some<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.989> common

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
really easy what are some of the common

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.309 
really easy what are some of the common
mistakes<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.799> women<00:02:44.370> make<00:02:44.519> attachment<00:02:45.390> in

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
mistakes that women make attachment in

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.449 
mistakes that women make attachment in
the<00:02:46.440> early<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.500> biggest<00:02:49.709> mistake<00:02:49.980> is

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the early I think the biggest mistake is

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.339 
the early I think the biggest mistake is
taking<00:02:51.330> each<00:02:51.390> other<00:02:51.599> for<00:02:51.690> granted<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
taking each other for granted and

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.949 
taking each other for granted and
assuming<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.180> seal

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
assuming that because you have this seal

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.839 
assuming that because you have this seal
of<00:02:55.110> monogamy<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.860> your<00:02:56.069> relationship<00:02:56.670> if

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
of monogamy on your relationship if

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.860 
of monogamy on your relationship if
that's<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.299> relationship<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that's the kind of relationship that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
that's the kind of relationship that
you're<00:02:58.019> going<00:02:58.260> for<00:02:58.500> which<00:02:59.160> which<00:02:59.400> most<00:02:59.640> people

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
you're going for which which most people

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.270 
you're going for which which most people
do<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.230> allows<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.830> kind<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.040> slack

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
do that that allows you to kind of slack

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.890 
do that that allows you to kind of slack
off<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> little<00:03:02.670> bit<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.359> all<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> sudden

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
off a little bit and all of a sudden

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.479 
off a little bit and all of a sudden
women<00:03:04.380> are<00:03:04.500> breaking<00:03:04.829> out<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> sweat<00:03:05.250> pants

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
women are breaking out the sweat pants

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.580 
women are breaking out the sweat pants
and<00:03:05.850> they're<00:03:05.940> not<00:03:06.060> uh<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:06.989> going<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:07.410> to

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
and they're not uh you know going out to

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.520 
and they're not uh you know going out to
nice<00:03:07.739> places<00:03:07.950> anymore<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.470> personally<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
nice places anymore and personally I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
nice places anymore and personally I
think<00:03:10.859> that's<00:03:11.190> very<00:03:11.400> disingenuous<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:12.269> like

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
think that's very disingenuous it's like
