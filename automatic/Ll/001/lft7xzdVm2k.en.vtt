00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
to do that I'd be weird but um that's

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.390 
to do that I'd be weird but um that's
just<00:04:27.900> something<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.440> didn't<00:04:29.190> really

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
just something I didn't really

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.730 
just something I didn't really
understand<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.270> noticed<00:04:30.840> less<00:04:31.169> of<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.530> when

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
understand but I noticed less of it when

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.730 
understand but I noticed less of it when
I<00:04:31.770> had<00:04:32.040> more<00:04:32.280> subs<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.139> I<00:04:34.139> feel<00:04:34.320> like<00:04:34.440> it's<00:04:34.650> a

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
I had more subs and I feel like it's a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.270 
I had more subs and I feel like it's a
sub<00:04:35.010> thing<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.580> people<00:04:35.669> just<00:04:35.970> put<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.900> higher

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
sub thing and people just put the higher

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.860 
sub thing and people just put the higher
sub<00:04:38.450> little<00:04:39.450> bit<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.750> higher<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:41.570> people<00:04:42.570> on

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
sub little bit of a higher the people on

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.810 
sub little bit of a higher the people on
a<00:04:43.169> pedestal<00:04:43.530> because<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:44.220> their<00:04:44.370> sub<00:04:44.580> count

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
a pedestal because of their sub count

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.920 
a pedestal because of their sub count
which<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.150> don't<00:04:45.210> really<00:04:45.419> think<00:04:45.540> it's<00:04:45.870> fair

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
which I don't really think it's fair

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.100 
which I don't really think it's fair
because<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.310> my<00:04:47.490> opinion<00:04:48.020> everyone<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.500> uh

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
because in my opinion everyone is uh

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.530 
because in my opinion everyone is uh
should<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.380> an<00:04:52.980> equal<00:04:53.100> amount<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:54.030> respect

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
should have an equal amount of respect

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.409 
should have an equal amount of respect
and<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:55.230> shouldn't<00:04:55.980> have<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.790> have<00:04:57.030> people

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
and you shouldn't have to have people

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.800 
and you shouldn't have to have people
like<00:04:58.130> think<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.550> as<00:04:59.730> better<00:05:00.120> because<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.600> a

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
like think of you as better because of a

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.440 
like think of you as better because of a
number<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.470> suppose<00:05:02.100> it's<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.970> internet

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
number I suppose it's just the internet

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.830 
number I suppose it's just the internet
it<00:05:03.630> doesn't<00:05:03.990> really<00:05:04.230> matter<00:05:04.470> you're<00:05:05.340> not

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
it doesn't really matter you're not

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.560 
it doesn't really matter you're not
anyone<00:05:06.840> i<00:05:06.870> guess<00:05:07.169> off<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.820> computer<00:05:09.180> I

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
anyone i guess off of the computer I

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.770 
anyone i guess off of the computer I
suppose<00:05:10.169> it's<00:05:11.130> like<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.760> bit<00:05:12.060> less<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.510> trying

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
suppose it's like a bit less is trying

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.740 
suppose it's like a bit less is trying

long<00:05:59.400> time<00:05:59.460> to<00:05:59.669> do<00:05:59.940> i<00:05:59.970> couldn't<00:06:00.330> do<00:06:00.419> this<00:06:00.570> for<00:06:00.750> a

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
long time to do i couldn't do this for a

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.360 
long time to do i couldn't do this for a
long<00:06:00.930> time<00:06:01.169> so<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.620> like<00:06:01.800> doing<00:06:01.950> these<00:06:02.100> hearts

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370
