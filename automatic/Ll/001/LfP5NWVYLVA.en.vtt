1000<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.780> 2000<00:02:13.560> TNT<00:02:13.860> they<00:02:14.010> didn't<00:02:14.250> crash<00:02:14.430> they

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
1000 to 2000 TNT they didn't crash they

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
1000 to 2000 TNT they didn't crash they
slagged<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.270> same<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.960> think<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.740> like<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
slagged the same way I think it's like a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.590 
slagged the same way I think it's like a
crash<00:02:17.190> guard<00:02:17.580> or<00:02:17.760> something<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.330> game

crash guard or something in this game

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.650 
crash guard or something in this game

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
because it just lags hard and it just

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
because it just lags hard and it just
doesn't<00:02:22.050> crash<00:02:25.070> yes<00:02:26.070> definitely<00:02:26.340> not<00:02:26.550> gonna
