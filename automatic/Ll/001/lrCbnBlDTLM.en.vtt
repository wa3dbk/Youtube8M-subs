people<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.600> done<00:00:30.750> all<00:00:30.930> kinds<00:00:31.350> of<00:00:31.410> cool<00:00:31.710> rigs

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
people have done all kinds of cool rigs

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.010 
people have done all kinds of cool rigs
to<00:00:32.520> move<00:00:32.850> their<00:00:33.180> camera<00:00:33.570> while<00:00:33.720> it's<00:00:33.870> doing

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
to move their camera while it's doing

time-lapse making a pan side-to-side or

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.410 
time-lapse making a pan side-to-side or
slide<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.890> usually<00:00:38.220> these<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.430> complex<00:00:39.060> now

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
slide but usually these are complex now

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450 
slide but usually these are complex now
I<00:00:39.480> saw<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.620> egg<00:00:40.829> timer<00:00:41.130> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
I saw one that's just an egg timer that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.190 
I saw one that's just an egg timer that
you<00:00:41.550> fastened<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.090> camera<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you fastened your camera on top of and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.229 
you fastened your camera on top of and
it<00:00:43.680> has<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> nice<00:00:44.040> panning<00:00:44.489> effect<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.090> looked

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it has a nice panning effect it looked

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
it has a nice panning effect it looked
really<00:00:45.420> great<00:00:45.630> and<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:45.989> was<00:00:46.050> dirt<00:00:46.260> cheap<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
really great and it was dirt cheap and I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
really great and it was dirt cheap and I
thought<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.790> try<00:00:47.970> my<00:00:48.210> hand<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.660> doing

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
thought I would try my hand at doing

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.710 
thought I would try my hand at doing
something<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.130> simple<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> sliding

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
something just as simple for the sliding

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.080 
something just as simple for the sliding
effect<00:00:52.050> moving<00:00:52.649> your<00:00:52.770> camera<00:00:52.980> sideways<00:00:53.640> while

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
effect moving your camera sideways while

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.700 
effect moving your camera sideways while
it<00:00:54.239> films<00:00:54.710> okay<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> goal<00:00:56.130> is<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> move<00:00:56.640> my

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
it films okay so the goal is to move my

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.440 
it films okay so the goal is to move my
time-lapse<00:00:58.710> camera<00:00:59.219> sideways<00:00:59.879> while<00:01:00.270> it's

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
time-lapse camera sideways while it's

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.009 
time-lapse camera sideways while it's
recording<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:01.110> liked<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> idea<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
recording I liked the idea of the

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.359 
recording I liked the idea of the
kitchen<00:01:04.019> timer<00:01:04.259> so<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.949> did<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> got

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
kitchen timer so that's what I did I got

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.499 
kitchen timer so that's what I did I got
a<00:01:05.399> kitchen<00:01:05.789> timer<00:01:05.969> I<00:01:06.859> fastened<00:01:07.859> a<00:01:08.209> spray<00:01:09.209> paint

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
a kitchen timer I fastened a spray paint

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.590 
a kitchen timer I fastened a spray paint
lid<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:10.950> top<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:11.850> screws<00:01:12.179> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
lid to the top of it with two screws and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.370 
lid to the top of it with two screws and
I<00:01:13.170> tied<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:13.439> fishing<00:01:14.009> line<00:01:14.039> to<00:01:14.429> it<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:15.539> I<00:01:15.990> can

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I tied some fishing line to it now I can

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.580 
I tied some fishing line to it now I can
attach<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.859> fishing<00:01:17.279> line<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:18.139> my<00:01:19.139> camera

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
attach that fishing line to my camera

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.889 
attach that fishing line to my camera
wind<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.069> the<00:01:20.159> timer<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.819> it<00:01:20.969> unwinds<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
wind up the timer and as it unwinds it

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.819 
wind up the timer and as it unwinds it
will<00:01:22.049> pull<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.649> camera<00:01:22.889> along<00:01:24.469> it's<00:01:25.469> not<00:01:25.560> very

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
will pull the camera along it's not very

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:27.559 
will pull the camera along it's not very
strong<00:01:26.100> though<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.819> have<00:01:27.029> to<00:01:27.179> do<00:01:27.329> some

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
strong though so you have to do some

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.289 
strong though so you have to do some
things<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.020> help<00:01:28.139> I'm<00:01:28.560> using<00:01:28.859> Lego<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.819> made<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
things to help I'm using Lego I made a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.449 
things to help I'm using Lego I made a
little<00:01:30.479> Lego<00:01:30.869> trolley<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.499> attached<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
little Lego trolley I attached the

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.730 
little Lego trolley I attached the
string<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> put<00:01:33.719> the<00:01:33.810> camera<00:01:34.139> on<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
string to it put the camera on it and it

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.889 
string to it put the camera on it and it
rolls<00:01:34.979> along<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.490> surface<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.299> works<00:01:36.479> okay

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
rolls along a surface it works okay

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.440 
rolls along a surface it works okay
however<00:01:37.529> if<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.189> surface<00:01:38.399> is<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.939> perfectly

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
however if the surface is not perfectly

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.389 
however if the surface is not perfectly
smooth<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.679> if<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> camera<00:01:41.249> is<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.369> little

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
smooth or if the camera is a little

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.359 
smooth or if the camera is a little
heavy<00:01:41.819> it<00:01:42.359> doesn't<00:01:42.840> work<00:01:43.020> great<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.709> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
heavy it doesn't work great but the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.529 
heavy it doesn't work great but the
timer<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.529> quite<00:01:47.009> strong<00:01:47.459> enough<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.299> drag

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
timer is not quite strong enough to drag

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.870 
timer is not quite strong enough to drag
it<00:01:48.779> now<00:01:49.409> you'll<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:49.709> I've<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.579> two

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it now you'll see I've actually put two

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.459 
it now you'll see I've actually put two
screws<00:01:51.149> through<00:01:51.599> this<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.200> don't<00:01:52.289> even

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
screws through this you don't even

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.989 
screws through this you don't even
necessarily<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:53.099> to<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.429> that<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.849> can

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
necessarily have to do that if you can

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:55.819 
necessarily have to do that if you can
find<00:01:54.209> a<00:01:54.299> timer<00:01:54.539> this<00:01:54.810> cylindrical<00:01:55.409> shape<00:01:55.619> or

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
find a timer this cylindrical shape or

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.499 
find a timer this cylindrical shape or
egg-shaped<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.520> could<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.909> tape<00:01:57.239> your

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
egg-shaped you could just tape your

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.870 
egg-shaped you could just tape your
string<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.709> timer<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.249> not<00:01:59.429> really<00:01:59.700> even

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
string to the timer and not really even

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.419 
string to the timer and not really even
have<00:01:59.999> to<00:02:00.119> use<00:02:00.270> any<00:02:00.450> tools<00:02:00.829> it<00:02:01.829> works<00:02:02.069> okay<00:02:02.399> but
