chassis setup was breakfast so forth

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.250 
chassis setup was breakfast so forth
what<00:04:19.489> other<00:04:19.639> drivers<00:04:19.850> hadn't<00:04:20.750> learned<00:04:20.989> that

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
what other drivers hadn't learned that

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.879 
what other drivers hadn't learned that
yet<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:22.760> was<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> great<00:04:23.180> race<00:04:23.450> driver<00:04:23.840> he<00:04:24.680> drove

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
yet it was a great race driver he drove

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.360 
yet it was a great race driver he drove
for<00:04:25.070> me<00:04:25.220> three<00:04:25.520> years<00:04:26.139> and<00:04:27.139> we<00:04:27.350> won<00:04:27.620> races<00:04:27.919> and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
for me three years and we won races and

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.100 
for me three years and we won races and
then<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.639> feel<00:04:28.850> sit<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.330> pole<00:04:29.540> i<00:04:29.840> stuff

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
then you feel sit on the pole i stuff

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.200 
then you feel sit on the pole i stuff
like<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> lot<00:04:30.800> with<00:04:30.979> Neil<00:04:31.729> Bonnett<00:04:31.910> was<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
like that a lot with Neil Bonnett was a

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.330 
like that a lot with Neil Bonnett was a
junior<00:04:32.510> Johnson<00:04:32.810> driver<00:04:33.380> he<00:04:33.860> was<00:04:34.010> out<00:04:34.160> of<00:04:34.190> the

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
junior Johnson driver he was out of the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.920 
junior Johnson driver he was out of the
mold<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.669> Bobby<00:04:34.880> Allison<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.660> Cale

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
mold of Bobby Allison and Cale

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
mold of Bobby Allison and Cale
Yarborough<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:37.700> means<00:04:37.940> he<00:04:38.090> was

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
Yarborough and that means he was

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.460 
Yarborough and that means he was
aggressive<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.930> means<00:04:39.080> he<00:04:39.169> could<00:04:39.320> be<00:04:39.350> a

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
aggressive and that means he could be a

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.529 
aggressive and that means he could be a
mean<00:04:39.770> driver<00:04:40.130> Earnhardt<00:04:40.729> has<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.090> streak<00:04:41.389> in

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
mean driver Earnhardt has that streak in

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.300 
mean driver Earnhardt has that streak in
him<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:42.229> yet<00:04:42.440> when<00:04:42.740> he<00:04:42.770> gets<00:04:42.979> out<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.160> that

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
him and yet when he gets out of that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.090 
him and yet when he gets out of that
race<00:04:43.610> car<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:44.270> think<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.289> word<00:04:45.440> is<00:04:45.620> integrity

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
race car I think the word is integrity

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.370 
race car I think the word is integrity
that's<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.210> word<00:04:47.360> for<00:04:47.539> Neil<00:04:47.720> Bonneville

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
that's the word for Neil Bonneville

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.820 
that's the word for Neil Bonneville
he<00:04:48.650> has<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> lot<00:04:49.190> of<00:04:49.220> integrity
