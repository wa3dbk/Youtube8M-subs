00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.650
 hello to all and skyros bosses how that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.270
 is going well today for the newspaper 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.130
 of cod and this week a newspaper 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.420
 special clips from my subscribers and yes 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.310
 I did not have any concrete information 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.410
 about call of duty and I prefer me 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.489
 based on real facts rather than 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.680
 rumors and like last week 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.150
 it was a special low newspaper for 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.190
 information about call of duty 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.050
 Bogost and for this week that 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.430
 will be a top kill special of the week 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.780
 and what the fuck fuck and we start 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.520
 right now with the top keep 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.010
 of the week and a clip really a 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.900
 huge clipping on the map 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.510
 express at the 94 n 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.430
 he's going to really make us a slap not 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.690
 frankly a huge sequence well 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.000
 played to him because when I saw that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.680
 I said wow it does not stop there is nothing 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.149
 to say then she she chained them the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.530
 dudes behind they see me nothing coming 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.760
 he goes into the pile a little bit like 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.350
 that but it can not be enough 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.119
 responsive and will still make us a 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.100
 superb web and it's going to be already 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.600
 there in extermination if I'm wrong 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.369
 in extermination ie 8 here 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.050
 but he still does not stop their 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.240
 and the years without mercy but the test on 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.410
 fire it scrolls the enemies 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.509
 arrive each time to him but 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.190
 can not really touch or touch 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.770
 reach it and deny the kill is the most 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.210
 of ammo they rock on are at 45 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.590
 who continues a little bit his pelvis that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.150
 I told myself he's never going to stop 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.010
 and unfortunately his series ends here 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.270
 but really huge tight well played at 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.240
 you and there he takes the ballista a 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.250
 parterre in strategic point forgiveness and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.630
 chocolate tschopp boom and the fourth 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.680
 for cua queue and do not stop 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.330
 continue them with a small fifth 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.729
 to keep driving so really 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.530
 well played to you on rai always with 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.780
 the raging asca he's going to make us a huge 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 series because already he's going to make us a 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.080
 very good web and help you there 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.970
 is already in a pitiful circus 15 without 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.560
 die so frankly well played to you 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.020
 because it's a good series 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.610
 while you are already in series here we are 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.890
 can say it laurent comes to play to you 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.030
 a little back on black ops and on a 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.770
 map which I got a sweater no but he 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.409
 in qg at mp 5 and will do us a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.470
 good catch of q I looked at that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.239
 he makes a triple faithful mp7 mp5 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.769
 pardon where the lodge and evil and to 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.510
 let's go with the magnum all that 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.530
 really played well on you on a double 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.239
 to be a little back ball look of 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.340
 triplet palms shot in a ball you 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.510
 that's nice it's there I have not 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.730
 used to take clips on a 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.829
 newton and even less baho remington 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.700
 but this one frankly was great 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.829
 strategic jobs 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.750
 how to take the point and defend it 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.160
 really with a maximum of style he's going 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.139
 we do a series of broadcasts 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.730
 really very very pretty and behind for 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:35.200
 recover the strategic point 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.669
 I thought it was a really 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.519
 very nice game action so toys 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:41.139
 to you to her and mw3 the p90 to this little 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.609
 gun tr r what was it good 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.660
 and he will make us a good little 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.040
 chaining then he has the good 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.540
 technique to sleep well for not 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.799
 to be killed I'm still raging a little 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.180
 little against the enemies who do that because 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.010
 that it is very difficult to kill especially 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.570
 when the sniper but in any case good 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.040
 it's the technique just killed without 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.109
 to kill is a little bit the goal 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.370
 of the game he's going to make us a duvet 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.440
 yarn with and behind a very pretty 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.150
 chain that happens as a specialist 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.400
 so really well played to you for this 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 small series and we continue on 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.209
 this map drone is there really has a 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.530
 clip I'm twelve heil is awesome 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.609
 mc alger where I come from and not on it 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.410
 we 3 at home how he did 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.150
 so there he became a single colada for 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.919
 the triple filter bonds and there he 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.570
 continue his carnage for a multi he 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:18.220
 so here's a cross on 12 behind 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.410
 so play early was really a 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.090
 huge clip there and takes her little 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.220
 dessert there are always campers on 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.090
 standoff the eva big revenge boom 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.100
 triplette toilets 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.340
 go hop that's the campers 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.350
 release from the huge series in the aemf and 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.150
 seven on carrier mp7 what am I 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.709
 tells m 27 I have trouble this morning and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.600
 in any case it's a huge series 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.199
 with its quick charger and its 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.120
 quiet 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.410
 he will really sweep them away then there is 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.699
 the orbital station that he is really 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.680
 and in addition it unlocks a second 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.900
 orbital station have nothing of the kind to 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.489
 do and continue his carnage he goes 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.380
 we will go without mercy and watch 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.820
 behind he's going to do what's called the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.040
 challenge chief of mines to sion ie 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.389
 8 and night a nine and a half at least to 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.160
 align so it's really very very 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.560
 pretty and this one preaches it or two 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.449
 xpm studios look at balms a ball 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.620
 threesome shot it's beautiful and the 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:08.049
 little reaction who had who is well 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.519
 laugh at the store or east for the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.139
 last clip to the tags you really have 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.269
 huge clip and schott was watching 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.769
 churchill does not stop there and schott 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.840
 and the fourth agent for quetsche 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.100
 Cat beautiful on screen well played 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.780
 you and well played at all it's true 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.829
 really very pretty clip and we 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.050
 continue with the lol 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.430
 what the fuck file et cetera and the one 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.540
 it's really huge 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.830
 when I saw them I said what is it 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.030
 that happened it's not possible then 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.110
 I accelerate a little bit at the beginning because 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.669
 that at studious word I have the impression 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.740
 that he is a little galley but 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.210
 look at the knife that left not 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.310
 everything already launched on the enemy and which 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.530
 turns as saipem that comes down to 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.030
 moment when it passes frankly it's not 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.919
 of luck for him and again 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.529
 a small knife bouncing boom on 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.999
 the wall 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.379
 comes crashing down in his thesis finally 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.849
 rather what versions as if 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.049
 it was a magnet and it does not kill 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.959
 while we know that usually on a 

00:04:48.049 --> 00:04:52.039
 new e3 that you really easy and what 

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:53.089
 the fuck what happened is 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.979
 not serious considering the finish anyway at 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:57.169
 well done knife to you you did not do 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.999
 kill and a rcd on black ops that does not 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.799
 is strictly for nothing the explosion does not 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.389
 do absolutely nothing so that's so much 

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:03.889
 better for him remarks and he's not going 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.059
 dying will not be farted so that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.639
 it's still good news and 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.779
 this one is a troll age it's the same 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.129
 in not really used to take 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.339
 to be the age but then the enemy was 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.449
 really and we can say it stupid 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.189
 look he was killed so 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.389
 inevitably small revenge would go to paris 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.339
 next so he will try to take revenge 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.539
 and here he is he says I do not do that 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.769
 kill like that it's too easy 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.969
 I will try to fuck myself a little bit 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:24.799
 his mouth the troll is so I 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.359
 accelerated the clip too because it 

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:29.059
 was really long and the guy behind 

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:30.979
 it's the mountain gilbert of the call of il 

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.399
 does not see anything he pulls at him 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.319
 above 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:34.999
 he pulls him he is there and follows him as 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.919
 that but the guy does not calculate and god 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:38.389
 knows by possible what guy he is 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.319
 not go back a moment to say is this 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.669
 that a rabbit that is in the process of 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:42.529
 fuck off my mouth and that was the 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.909
 case so there are times it takes when 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.799
 even get to do little tricks and 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.079
 there I watched because even next to 

00:05:45.799 --> 00:05:50.149
 him from his allies and the guy he gets 

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:51.559
 not even returns cold and no 

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.759
 frankly it's not possible this guy there 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.399
 I'm going as hollow sunglasses 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.409
 mw3 is the options they are drones 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.209
 dassault is unfortunately nothing happens 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.489
 will go with since the big bug it 

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:02.569
 going through the wall is then the 

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:04.009
 drone dassault him can get through 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.239
 the wall but the balls against her 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.229
 do not pass then what is enough 

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:08.269
 surprising since we still arrive at 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.569
 kill through the wall but except the walls 

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:12.859
 these are not really bullets 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:14.629
 this is a bit annoying 

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:16.189
 and the big mint big 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:17.419
 pressure there I do not know I do not know what 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.519
 happened in the enemy's head 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.549

 there he tries the little knife so I 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.219
