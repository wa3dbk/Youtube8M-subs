00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
I've got a little window there with an

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.319 
I've got a little window there with an
umbrella<00:00:46.160> on<00:00:46.339> it<00:00:46.460> I'm<00:00:46.519> gonna<00:00:46.640> attempt<00:00:47.269> to

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
umbrella on it I'm gonna attempt to

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.759 
umbrella on it I'm gonna attempt to
knock<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:47.719> off<00:00:47.780> or<00:00:48.050> at<00:00:48.109> least<00:00:48.260> keep<00:00:48.410> it<00:00:48.530> under

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
knock that off or at least keep it under

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.560 
knock that off or at least keep it under
there<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.219> it's<00:00:49.399> only<00:00:49.519> well<00:00:50.239> I<00:00:50.300> don't<00:00:50.449> know<00:00:50.510> if

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
there and it's only well I don't know if

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.150 
there and it's only well I don't know if
that's<00:00:50.719> a<00:00:50.809> couple<00:00:50.989> feet<00:00:51.260> high<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.039> way<00:00:52.129> I

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
that's a couple feet high so the way I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.340 
that's a couple feet high so the way I
can<00:00:52.249> do<00:00:52.519> that<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:53.239> by<00:00:53.449> having<00:00:53.629> my<00:00:53.809> hand<00:00:54.019> quite<00:00:54.289> a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
can do that is by having my hand quite a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.410 
can do that is by having my hand quite a
bit<00:00:54.530> forward<00:00:54.800> again<00:00:55.429> I<00:00:55.460> recommend<00:00:55.670> starting

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
bit forward again I recommend starting

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.270 
bit forward again I recommend starting
off<00:00:56.539> very<00:00:56.570> small<00:00:56.870> we'll<00:00:57.829> see<00:00:57.920> how<00:00:58.010> many<00:00:58.070> shots

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
off very small we'll see how many shots

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.649 
off very small we'll see how many shots
it<00:00:58.429> takes<00:00:58.579> me<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.760> knock<00:00:58.909> this<00:00:59.059> thing<00:00:59.269> off<00:00:59.449> I

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
it takes me to knock this thing off I

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.349 
it takes me to knock this thing off I
hopefully<00:00:59.839> only<00:01:00.409> one<00:01:00.859> let's<00:01:01.760> see<00:01:01.940> here<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:02.329> a

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
hopefully only one let's see here so a

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.360 
hopefully only one let's see here so a
little<00:01:02.510> little<00:01:03.109> punch<00:01:03.350> shot<00:01:05.980> just<00:01:06.980> burn<00:01:07.190> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830
