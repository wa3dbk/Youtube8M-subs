they're real quickly if the gameplay

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
they're real quickly if the gameplay
looks<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:25.949> kind<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.189> jerky<00:00:26.730> or<00:00:26.760> weird<00:00:27.269> or

glitchy<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.349> sometimes<00:00:29.189> slow<00:00:29.490> motion<00:00:29.970> then

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
glitchy and sometimes slow motion then

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120

the<00:02:44.830> video<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> time<00:02:45.640> when<00:02:45.849> we<00:02:45.910> when<00:02:46.360> we

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
the video at the time when we when we

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.750 
the video at the time when we when we
can<00:02:46.630> only<00:02:46.720> speculate<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.040> we're<00:02:48.310> but

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760

would you like to see a nuke in the game

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.460 
would you like to see a nuke in the game

nothing as exciting as a mob or a new
cause<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:38.690> could<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.080> kill<00:04:39.289> the<00:04:39.470> entire

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
cause that could just kill the entire

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.379 
cause that could just kill the entire
enemy<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.759> was<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:40.880> real<00:04:41.090> kind<00:04:41.270> of

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
enemy and it was a real kind of

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.870 
enemy and it was a real kind of
impressive<00:04:41.750> thing<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.380> just<00:04:42.530> get<00:04:42.770> one<00:04:42.979> but<00:04:43.490> we

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
impressive thing to just get one but we

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.370 
impressive thing to just get one but we
know<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.210> other<00:04:44.330> hand<00:04:44.509> infinite<00:04:45.020> or<00:04:45.139> they

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
know on the other hand infinite or they

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.379 
know on the other hand infinite or they
will<00:04:45.500> definitely<00:04:45.949> have<00:04:46.160> something<00:04:46.610> like<00:04:47.090> this

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
will definitely have something like this

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.900 
will definitely have something like this
and<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:48.320> also<00:04:48.470> ties<00:04:48.889> very<00:04:49.250> heavily<00:04:49.520> into<00:04:49.789> the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
and it also ties very heavily into the

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.330 
and it also ties very heavily into the
story<00:04:50.240> at<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:51.020> reason<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.740> earth<00:04:51.889> is<00:04:52.130> so

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
story at the reason that the earth is so

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.670 
story at the reason that the earth is so
messed<00:04:52.669> up<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.120> because<00:04:53.360> some<00:04:54.320> South<00:04:54.560> American

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
messed up is because some South American

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.040 
messed up is because some South American
army<00:04:55.310> has<00:04:55.699> hijacked<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.449> u.s.<00:04:56.810> satellites

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
army has hijacked the u.s. satellites

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.779 
army has hijacked the u.s. satellites
that<00:04:57.530> holding<00:04:57.979> nuke<00:04:58.190> or<00:04:58.430> some<00:04:58.580> kind<00:04:58.760> of

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
that holding nuke or some kind of

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.310 
that holding nuke or some kind of
nuclear<00:04:59.000> devices<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.810> they<00:05:00.139> basically

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
nuclear devices and they basically

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.800 
nuclear devices and they basically
destroyed<00:05:01.070> America<00:05:01.669> in<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:01.940> story<00:05:02.180> so<00:05:02.539> where

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
destroyed America in the story so where

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.659 
destroyed America in the story so where
this<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.590> why<00:05:03.800> all<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.010> math<00:05:04.160> bear<00:05:04.340> maps<00:05:04.550> are

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
this is why all the math bear maps are

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.100 
this is why all the math bear maps are
going<00:05:04.789> to<00:05:04.850> look<00:05:04.910> kind<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.270> broken<00:05:05.600> and

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
going to look kind of broken and

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.320 
going to look kind of broken and
destroyed<00:05:06.740> and<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.370> of<00:05:07.490> derelict<00:05:07.940> like<00:05:08.090> that

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
destroyed and kind of derelict like that

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.180 
destroyed and kind of derelict like that
because<00:05:08.780> they're<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.680> earth<00:05:09.889> has<00:05:10.160> been

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
because they're that the earth has been

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.090 
because they're that the earth has been
looped<00:05:10.639> very<00:05:10.970> heavily<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.539> so<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.590> ties<00:05:12.860> into

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
looped very heavily and so it ties into

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.950 
looped very heavily and so it ties into
the<00:05:13.250> story<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.910> there<00:05:14.389> are<00:05:14.479> nukes<00:05:14.720> in

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
the story that there are nukes in

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.960 
the story that there are nukes in
satellites<00:05:15.590> ready<00:05:15.889> to<00:05:15.979> be<00:05:16.099> launched<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.580> it

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
satellites ready to be launched and it

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.430 
satellites ready to be launched and it
kind<00:05:17.330> of<00:05:17.389> makes<00:05:17.630> sense<00:05:17.840> that<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.199> would<00:05:18.410> be

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
kind of makes sense that this would be

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.980 
kind of makes sense that this would be
some<00:05:18.800> kind<00:05:19.039> of<00:05:19.130> secret<00:05:20.120> school<00:05:20.419> streak<00:05:20.750> or

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
some kind of secret school streak or

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.450 
some kind of secret school streak or
point<00:05:21.260> streak<00:05:21.620> or<00:05:21.830> whatever<00:05:22.099> you<00:05:22.220> want<00:05:22.370> to

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
point streak or whatever you want to

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.550 
point streak or whatever you want to
call<00:05:22.610> it<00:05:22.669> add<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.570> into<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.900> multiplayer<00:05:24.320> side

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
call it add it into the multiplayer side

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.439 
call it add it into the multiplayer side
of<00:05:24.650> things<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:25.009> really<00:05:25.220> would<00:05:25.610> make<00:05:25.880> sense<00:05:26.180> and

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
of things it really would make sense and

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.990 
of things it really would make sense and
it<00:05:27.139> will<00:05:27.229> be<00:05:27.320> kind<00:05:27.560> of<00:05:27.620> equal<00:05:28.340> with<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.729> story

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
it will be kind of equal with the story

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.219 
it will be kind of equal with the story
if<00:05:29.270> they<00:05:29.419> would<00:05:29.570> have<00:05:29.750> something<00:05:29.960> like<00:05:30.110> this

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
if they would have something like this

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.710 
if they would have something like this
but<00:05:30.889> there<00:05:31.130> maybe<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.639> would<00:05:31.760> require<00:05:31.940> like<00:05:32.419> 30

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
but there maybe it would require like 30

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.300 
but there maybe it would require like 30
kills<00:05:33.110> with<00:05:33.349> your<00:05:33.500> gun<00:05:33.740> maybe<00:05:33.979> they'll

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
kills with your gun maybe they'll

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.760 
kills with your gun maybe they'll
actually<00:05:34.490> raise<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.180> bar<00:05:35.389> and<00:05:35.599> make<00:05:36.470> it<00:05:36.650> like

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
actually raise the bar and make it like

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.129 
actually raise the bar and make it like
35<00:05:37.520> kills<00:05:37.910> with<00:05:38.150> your<00:05:38.330> gun<00:05:38.510> they<00:05:38.660> seem<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:38.900> kind

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
35 kills with your gun they seem to kind

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.140 
35 kills with your gun they seem to kind
of<00:05:39.229> raised<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.590> every<00:05:39.889> game<00:05:40.130> maybe<00:05:40.789> it's

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
of raised in every game maybe it's

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.810 
of raised in every game maybe it's
actually<00:05:41.539> a<00:05:41.570> kill<00:05:41.840> streak<00:05:41.960> by<00:05:42.320> itself<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.070> you

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
actually a kill streak by itself and you

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.370 
actually a kill streak by itself and you
can<00:05:44.210> get<00:05:44.630> kills<00:05:44.930> with<00:05:45.169> your<00:05:45.320> other

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
can get kills with your other

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.290 
can get kills with your other
killstreaks<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.190> actually<00:05:46.490> count<00:05:46.669> towards<00:05:47.180> it

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
killstreaks to actually count towards it

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.689 
killstreaks to actually count towards it
but<00:05:47.659> maybe<00:05:47.900> it'll<00:05:48.139> take<00:05:48.470> like<00:05:48.710> 50<00:05:49.280> kills<00:05:49.520> or

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
but maybe it'll take like 50 kills or

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.610 
but maybe it'll take like 50 kills or
something<00:05:50.090> crazy<00:05:50.240> like<00:05:50.570> that<00:05:50.720> and<00:05:51.139> you<00:05:51.470> can

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
something crazy like that and you can

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.990 
something crazy like that and you can
actually<00:05:51.740> earn<00:05:52.010> it<00:05:52.220> which<00:05:52.340> would<00:05:52.550> be<00:05:52.669> a<00:05:52.699> kind

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
actually earn it which would be a kind

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.790 
actually earn it which would be a kind
of<00:05:53.090> challenge<00:05:53.419> that<00:05:53.449> would<00:05:53.810> be<00:05:53.990> balanced<00:05:54.740> in

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
of challenge that would be balanced in

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.879 
of challenge that would be balanced in
my<00:05:55.010> opinion<00:05:55.310> if<00:05:55.639> it<00:05:56.419> took<00:05:56.659> a<00:05:56.780> lot<00:05:56.990> of<00:05:57.050> kills<00:05:57.349> but

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
my opinion if it took a lot of kills but

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.770 
my opinion if it took a lot of kills but
you<00:05:57.949> could<00:05:58.159> get<00:05:58.370> it<00:05:58.490> with<00:05:58.610> your<00:05:58.789> actual<00:05:59.150> kill

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
you could get it with your actual kill

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.390 
you could get it with your actual kill
streaks<00:06:00.080> but<00:06:00.530> it's<00:06:00.860> definitely<00:06:01.039> going<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.340> be

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
streaks but it's definitely going to be

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.250 
streaks but it's definitely going to be
ridiculously<00:06:02.060> hard<00:06:02.330> to<00:06:02.510> get<00:06:02.720> I<00:06:02.750> do<00:06:02.870> know<00:06:03.229> that

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
ridiculously hard to get I do know that

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.710 
ridiculously hard to get I do know that
as<00:06:03.530> a<00:06:03.560> fact<00:06:03.680> so<00:06:04.400> we're<00:06:04.580> hopefully<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.330> won't<00:06:05.659> be

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
as a fact so we're hopefully it won't be

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.480 
as a fact so we're hopefully it won't be
too<00:06:05.780> difficult<00:06:06.260> to<00:06:06.620> get<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.800> have<00:06:07.010> a<00:06:07.039> feeling

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
too difficult to get I have a feeling

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.430 
too difficult to get I have a feeling
