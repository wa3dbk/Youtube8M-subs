00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
us by the things that we are listening

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.830 
us by the things that we are listening
to<00:02:34.169> and<00:02:34.319> Friends<00:02:34.730> music<00:02:35.730> above<00:02:36.299> many<00:02:36.630> other

music that we are listening to it's not

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.330 
music that we are listening to it's not
just<00:02:45.540> about<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.900> music<00:02:46.109> but<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.590> lyrics<00:02:47.130> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
just about the music but the lyrics that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.819 
just about the music but the lyrics that
attend<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.940> music<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:49.739> are

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
attend that music and if we are

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.949 
attend that music and if we are
listening<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.310> worldly<00:02:50.579> music<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.750> guess

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
listening to worldly music and guess

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.140 
listening to worldly music and guess
what<00:02:52.200> philosophy<00:02:52.889> we<00:02:53.010> are<00:02:53.130> being<00:02:53.340> taught<00:02:53.549> not

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
what philosophy we are being taught not

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.240 
what philosophy we are being taught not
the<00:02:54.329> philosophy<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:55.049> God<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.980> philosophy

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the philosophy of God but the philosophy

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.890 
the philosophy of God but the philosophy
of<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.940> world<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.480> last<00:02:57.690> time<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
of this world and the last time I

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.569 
of this world and the last time I
checked<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.410> Bible<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.859> devil<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
checked in the Bible the devil is the

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.620 
checked in the Bible the devil is the
prince<00:02:59.849> of<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.150> world

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
prince of this world

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.620 
prince of this world
so<00:03:01.109> basically<00:03:01.680> its<00:03:01.919> devilish<00:03:02.630> principles

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
so basically its devilish principles

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.009 
so basically its devilish principles
that<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.650> are<00:03:04.980> imitating<00:03:05.519> into<00:03:06.389> our<00:03:06.540> lives<00:03:06.840> and

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
that we are imitating into our lives and

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.220 
that we are imitating into our lives and
implementing<00:03:07.950> into<00:03:08.609> our<00:03:08.760> lives<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.049> is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
implementing into our lives so this is

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.409 
implementing into our lives so this is
why<00:03:10.349> God<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.889> calling<00:03:11.220> us<00:03:11.489> away<00:03:11.970> from<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
why God is calling us away from the

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.880 
why God is calling us away from the
