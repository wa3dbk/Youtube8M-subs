a small enough right now that we don't

then<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.599> came<00:03:22.810> right<00:03:23.139> up<00:03:23.169> and<00:03:23.470> I

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
then then this came right up and I

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.589 
then then this came right up and I
didn't<00:03:23.859> even<00:03:23.919> have<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.130> move<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.370> go<00:03:24.639> so<00:03:25.510> that

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
didn't even have to move to go so that

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.440 
didn't even have to move to go so that
was<00:03:25.720> good<00:03:25.900> well<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:27.010> operation<00:03:27.639> having

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
was good well this operation having

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.030 
was good well this operation having
started<00:03:28.630> from<00:03:28.870> scratch<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.739> don't<00:03:29.889> think

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
started from scratch and I don't think

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440 
started from scratch and I don't think
there's<00:03:30.160> another<00:03:30.310> formula<00:03:30.730> 1<00:03:30.879> team<00:03:31.090> out<00:03:31.269> there

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
there's another formula 1 team out there

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.940 
there's another formula 1 team out there
that's<00:03:31.690> been<00:03:31.870> started<00:03:32.260> from<00:03:32.410> scratch<00:03:32.560> in

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
that's been started from scratch in

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.879 
that's been started from scratch in
decades<00:03:34.230> knowing<00:03:35.230> all<00:03:35.379> you<00:03:35.500> did<00:03:35.650> about<00:03:35.829> the

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
decades knowing all you did about the

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.619 
decades knowing all you did about the
sport<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.579> what<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.030> McLaren<00:03:37.480> Technology

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
sport and what the McLaren Technology

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.690 
sport and what the McLaren Technology
Center<00:03:38.349> looks<00:03:38.560> like<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.250> halls<00:03:39.459> in

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
Center looks like and the halls in

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.369 
Center looks like and the halls in
Maranello<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.510> all<00:03:40.599> that<00:03:40.750> sort<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:41.049> thing<00:03:41.109> I

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
Maranello and all that sort of thing I

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.509 
Maranello and all that sort of thing I
mean<00:03:41.530> when<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.709> first<00:03:41.889> time<00:03:42.010> you<00:03:42.129> took<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.370> look

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
mean when the first time you took a look

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.520 
mean when the first time you took a look
at<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.760> facility<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.419> would<00:03:43.510> house<00:03:43.690> us<00:03:44.109> f1

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
at the facility that would house us f1

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.520 
at the facility that would house us f1
what<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.859> think<00:03:45.629> it<00:03:46.629> was<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.780> bit<00:03:46.930> Spartan<00:03:47.319> I

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
what you think it was a bit Spartan I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.680 
what you think it was a bit Spartan I
guess<00:03:47.769> but<00:03:48.099> I<00:03:48.669> know<00:03:48.940> there's<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.299> lot<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.480> people

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
guess but I know there's a lot of people

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.229 
guess but I know there's a lot of people
here<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.169> it'll<00:03:51.129> get<00:03:51.370> filled<00:03:51.609> up<00:03:51.760> really

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
here and it'll get filled up really

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.000 
here and it'll get filled up really
quickly<00:03:52.540> I<00:03:52.690> think<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.319> next<00:03:53.620> couple<00:03:53.799> months

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
quickly I think the next couple months

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.589 
quickly I think the next couple months
how<00:03:54.699> about<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:55.000> experience<00:03:55.389> of<00:03:55.449> actually

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
how about the experience of actually

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.479 
how about the experience of actually
working<00:03:55.930> as<00:03:56.230> an<00:03:56.379> engineer<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.799> Formula<00:03:57.220> One<00:03:57.340> is

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
working as an engineer in Formula One is

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.619 
working as an engineer in Formula One is
it<00:03:57.579> everything<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.879> thought<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.090> would<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.419> or

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
it everything you thought it would be or

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.699 
it everything you thought it would be or
different<00:03:58.989> in<00:03:59.049> some<00:03:59.169> way<00:03:59.349> uh<00:04:01.470> kind<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.530> hectic

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
different in some way uh kind of hectic

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.619 
different in some way uh kind of hectic
but<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:06.129> fun<00:04:06.370> do<00:04:07.090> something<00:04:07.359> different

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
but it's fun do something different

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.330 
but it's fun do something different
every<00:04:07.810> day<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.590> it's<00:04:08.680> good<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:09.010> be<00:04:09.129> with<00:04:09.280> a
