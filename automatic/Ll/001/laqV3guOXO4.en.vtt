00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.710 
something I learned this week is that
you<00:01:12.810> open<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.380> banana<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:14.670> easy<00:01:14.939> way<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> open<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you open a banana the easy way to open a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.710 
you open a banana the easy way to open a
banana<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.229> from<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> bottom<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.720> basically

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
banana is from the bottom and basically

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.859 
banana is from the bottom and basically
you<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.020> pinch<00:01:19.759> with<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:20.790> fingers<00:01:21.299> the

you just pinch with your fingers the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.850 
you just pinch with your fingers the
bottom<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.530> should<00:01:22.740> split<00:01:23.220> into<00:01:24.409> two<00:01:25.409> easy

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bottom and it should split into two easy

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
bottom and it should split into two easy
pieces<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.360> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
pieces like that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.319
