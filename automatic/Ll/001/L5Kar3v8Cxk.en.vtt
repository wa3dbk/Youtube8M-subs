00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.740
 Hello, Jakob from WebTV - 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.120
 - and today I come with this year's first review - 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.960
 - And it is from him here, Puma evoPOWER. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.820
 This brand new boot silo undoes the way we looked at power boots, - 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.080
 - because it is made to improve the way you kick, rather than the kick, 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.680
 - But how does the evoPOWER do that as a football boot? 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.660
 And gives it more power when you kick? 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.680
 Let's find out. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.940
 So come on! 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.300
 The evoPOWER is designed to maximize your foot's natural kick - 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.420
 - Through lots of research, Puma has found that kicking hardest when one's foot can move freely - 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.400
 - and at the same time they found that conventional boots do not let it do this - 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.020
 - simply because ordinary tops and sole do not let one move - 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.960
 - and this is what they want to change with the new evoPOWER. 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.960
 One of the biggest changes is on the top - 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.980
 - where the evoPOWER introduces a new Japanese microfiber, called AdapLite - 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.960
 - that is thin, soft and actually stretching very much - 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.240
 - it goes a lot with the foot - 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.120
 - but not in cross. 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.040
 This lets the boot follow the foot's movement when bending it in the middle of a kick - 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.540
 - and as I mentioned earlier, this transfer material is ridiculously soft - 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.280
 - and it really sneaks about the foot and gives a comfortable fit without getting too loose. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.720
 It may sound a bit crazy, but I actually thought you had to try it out to get an idea of ​​how cool it is. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.900
 It just feels right. 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.680
 When it comes to the evoPOWER's fit and comfort, it has an interesting combination of a wide load - 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.680
 - and I really mean a very wide load. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.580
 It is undoubtedly one of the widest boots I've ever tried - 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.660
 - and I have to say it is too spacious for my taste, 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.700
 - Because here at the instep, there is a little too much space. 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.280
 Another thing that usually prevents the foot from moving naturally is the sole - 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.700
 - and therefore Puma has made their GFS system - 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.360
 - Gradual Stability Frame System - 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 - which is a very rigid torsion bar under the foot - 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.020
 - progressively more flexible the farther down the foot you get. 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.600
 This makes it extremely flexible around the forefoot, - 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.600
 - and actually flex it both ways, allowing it to follow the natural movements of the foot - 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.040
 - so you are not held back by anything - 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:57.060
 - and GFS combined with this torsion bar, provides a very safe and stable base when moving - 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.120
 - and it feels really natural when moving the foot in all directions - 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.800
 - and it gives a feeling of freedom in evoPOWER - 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.860
 - which is a great feeling when attacking his opponent. 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.100
 When it comes to the ball feeling, the evoPOWER is quite interesting - 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.340
 - Because on one hand we have the super soft AdapLite, which sits close to the foot - 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.360
 - and on the other you find these AccuFoam Pods, which provide a larger and cleaner kicking surface, - 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.820
 - but they are also thicker, which makes them more padded, - 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.880
 - and this is an interesting mix, of upholstery and precision, - 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.560
 - and it's a delicious combination. 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.820
 When it comes to kicking, AccuFoam provides a clean kicking surface, - 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:20.880
 - But even though the boot is bold, it does not turn you into Marco Reus. 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:29.040
 However, this AccuFoam makes you feel less of your kick because the kick surface is bigger - 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.700
 - But you still have to do most of the work yourself, even though the boot is great. 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.880
 Now it's time for the big question; - 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.660
 - are you kicking harder in the new evoPOWER? 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.860
 Here I have to be honest because I have not felt much difference - 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.300
 - on the other hand, what I have the mark is that when you kick the ball hard, 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.560
 - you feel less of the shock from there. 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.640
 It feels as though the foot is moving more naturally, which removes this shock - 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:09.640
 - and it feels better to kick hard in evoPOWER than in other football boots, - 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.080
 - which is not what I figured at first, 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.760
 - But has it made my kicks harder? 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.440
 I didn't notice that. 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.180
 Has Puma done with evoPOWER what they wanted? 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.940
 Yes, they have, because even though I didn't notice a difference in power, 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.080
 - you want to kick hard in evoPOWER. 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.680
 The comfort is fine, the top is super soft - 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:56.380
 - and if it had not been so wide, I would definitely call it the best Puma boot ever - 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.580
 - it is probably really anyway and definitely worth a try - 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.480
 - especially if you have wide feet. 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.000
 This was what I thought of the all-new evoPOWER. 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.700
 What did you think of the new boot out there? 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.700
 Tell us in the comment box below. 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.400
 At the same time, remember to look 'behind the boot', where I tell you much more about the boot. 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.400
 Otherwise we will be seen later, here at Unisport WebTV. 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.600
 I am leaving! 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.400
 Cheerio.
