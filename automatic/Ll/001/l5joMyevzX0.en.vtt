00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
okay so here we are with Maria Sharapova

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.540 
okay so here we are with Maria Sharapova
checking<00:00:08.620> in<00:00:08.710> it<00:00:08.830> looks<00:00:08.980> like<00:00:09.130> she's<00:00:09.280> about<00:00:09.490> to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.550 
checking in it looks like she's about to

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.419 
checking in it looks like she's about to
take<00:00:09.820> some<00:00:10.059> practice<00:00:10.420> here<00:00:10.870> she's<00:00:11.110> been

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
take some practice here she's been

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.090 
take some practice here she's been
working<00:00:12.429> it<00:00:12.669> from<00:00:12.790> the<00:00:12.879> baseline<00:00:13.150> for<00:00:13.419> a<00:00:13.509> while

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.350 

but<00:00:18.100> I<00:00:18.160> think<00:00:18.190> Rec<00:00:18.550> players<00:00:18.850> should<00:00:19.030> take<00:00:19.210> away

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
but I think Rec players should take away

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.030 
but I think Rec players should take away
from<00:00:19.510> this<00:00:19.720> is<00:00:20.050> look<00:00:20.200> at<00:00:20.290> the<00:00:20.410> footwork

through the net all that asana but she

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
even though she's not considered you

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.500 
even though she's not considered you
know<00:00:40.329> a<00:00:40.390> big-time<00:00:40.749> volleyer<00:00:42.059> when<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.149> racket

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
know a big-time volleyer when the racket

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.130 
know a big-time volleyer when the racket
heads<00:00:43.690> up<00:00:45.089> pushes<00:00:46.089> the<00:00:46.210> hands<00:00:46.420> forward<00:00:46.780> notice

heads up pushes the hands forward notice

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.610 
heads up pushes the hands forward notice
how<00:00:47.409> the<00:00:47.949> hands<00:00:48.219> go<00:00:48.370> forward<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:50.230> always

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
how the hands go forward not always

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.329 
how the hands go forward not always
backed<00:00:50.890> like<00:00:51.159> a<00:00:51.190> volley

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
backed like a volley

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.209 
backed like a volley
yeah<00:00:54.339> very<00:00:54.879> busy<00:00:55.210> with<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.420> feet<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:57.129> kind

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
yeah very busy with the feet just kind

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
yeah very busy with the feet just kind
of<00:00:57.370> intercepted<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.030> ball<00:00:58.059> punching<00:00:58.899> it<00:00:58.989> back

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.249 

that's<00:01:05.500> what<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.800> looked<00:01:06.130> at<00:01:06.220> Maria<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.610> think

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
that's what I looked at Maria I think

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.830 
that's what I looked at Maria I think
she's<00:01:08.259> got<00:01:08.469> very<00:01:08.860> solid<00:01:09.369> volley<00:01:09.840> technique

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
she's got very solid volley technique

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.069 
she's got very solid volley technique
it's<00:01:11.619> not<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.799> lot<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.040> flaw<00:01:12.340> there<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.840> then<00:01:13.960> you

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
it's not a lot of flaw there so then you

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's not a lot of flaw there so then you
ask<00:01:14.229> yourself<00:01:14.680> why<00:01:14.860> does<00:01:15.009> he<00:01:15.189> come<00:01:15.579> to<00:01:15.729> the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
ask yourself why does he come to the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.719 
ask yourself why does he come to the
deck<00:01:16.000> more<00:01:16.149> often<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:16.750> think<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.520> not<00:01:18.700> the

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
deck more often I think it's not the

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.130 
deck more often I think it's not the
technique<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.360> killed<00:01:19.600> her<00:01:19.719> I<00:01:19.780> think<00:01:20.020> it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
technique that killed her I think it's

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.870 
technique that killed her I think it's
the<00:01:20.289> movement<00:01:20.770> around<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.130> bat<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.640> in

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
the movement around the bat and in

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.600 
the movement around the bat and in
particular<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.110> changing<00:01:23.590> those<00:01:23.770> directions

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
particular the changing those directions

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.069 
particular the changing those directions
you<00:01:24.969> got<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.210> wouldn't<00:01:25.479> she<00:01:25.539> get<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.840> net

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
you got it wouldn't she get to the net

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.779 
you got it wouldn't she get to the net
you<00:01:26.200> have<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.469> dive<00:01:26.710> around<00:01:26.950> it's<00:01:27.430> really<00:01:27.670> be

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
you have to dive around it's really be

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.929 
you have to dive around it's really be
athletic<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:29.259> she's<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.009> great<00:01:30.369> athlete<00:01:30.670> but

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
athletic and she's a great athlete but

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.760 
athletic and she's a great athlete but
that's<00:01:31.659> not<00:01:31.840> what<00:01:31.990> she's<00:01:32.140> known<00:01:32.289> for<00:01:32.350> she's

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
that's not what she's known for she's

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.260 
that's not what she's known for she's
not<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:32.950> quick<00:01:33.250> mover<00:01:33.640> where<00:01:33.880> she's<00:01:34.030> diving

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
not a quick mover where she's diving

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.630 
not a quick mover where she's diving
left<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:34.869> right<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.229> she's<00:01:35.409> that<00:01:35.619> it's<00:01:36.369> not<00:01:36.490> so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
left and right so she's that it's not so

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.279 
left and right so she's that it's not so
much<00:01:36.759> technique<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.450> my<00:01:37.570> opinion<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.109> keeps

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
much technique in my opinion that keeps

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.349 
much technique in my opinion that keeps
her<00:01:38.409> off<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.649> data<00:01:38.859> it<00:01:39.100> was<00:01:39.219> more<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:40.329> know

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
her off the data it was more you know

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.209 
her off the data it was more you know
court<00:01:40.719> coverage<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.350> even<00:01:41.829> though<00:01:41.920> she'd<00:01:42.130> be

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
court coverage and even though she'd be

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.560 
court coverage and even though she'd be
a<00:01:42.250> tough<00:01:42.490> presence<00:01:42.909> at<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.149> net<00:01:43.299> with<00:01:43.450> her

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
a tough presence at the net with her

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.050

you<00:01:54.399> move<00:01:54.579> more<00:01:54.820> aggressively<00:01:54.909> want<00:01:55.720> the

you move more aggressively want the
