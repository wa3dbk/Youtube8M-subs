00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.770
 or the youtube cloud here are better 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.330
 welcome gamer welcome to a boxing 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.670
 of the original gameboy which is a 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.619
 click brick is this console already what 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.630
 had previously analyzed the one that is 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.190
 as a red color that is also not 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.940
 it's an urban legend but well this is 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.370
 thing of the past 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.900
 I invite you to see the analysis in 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.739
 this analysis I tell you how many units 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.800
 sold shows the lit sign 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.660
 all technical specifications and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.059
 the buttons and all good I invite you to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.340
 that you see that analysis in fact is one of 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.170
 my first videos now I just 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.239
 I'm going to focus on unboxing because 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.370
 I had analyzed him as I said good 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.350
 as you can see this box is the first 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.239
 design had already shown them a 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.980
 boxing from another game boy identical to this 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.289
 but that the unboxing was of the model 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.820
 number 2 of the box that is more economical 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.640
 and just try the game boy and the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.710
 manual and nothing else this part of the good 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.930
 I'll try more things even if it does not come 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.340
 I'm missing my hearing aids but now 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.979
 We'll see when we get to that place 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.270
 As you can see here is the design of 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.340
 the box is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.469
 Super is one of the best designs 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.869
 that I have seen in my life in truth that 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.520
 It draws a lot of attention and this box is 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.090
 made with a very resistant material 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.770
 over time as it was 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.140
 varnished with a good plastic I do not know 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.969
 how to explain it but these boxes are 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.560
 resistant to scratches very very 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.689
 resistant also over time 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.729
 they almost do not get old unless it's 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.399
 solid as you can see then here says the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.649
 mark who am I going legendary brand of 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.959
 nintendo this logo here says it's 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.789
 the compact video video that insist that 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.860
 is compact a compact system of 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.530
 video games here tells you what it has 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.299
 says that brings a tetris brings this the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.880
 hearing aids that are missing anything 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.159
 I'm missing that cable to play 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.630
 that I'm going to game boy that is the game link and 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.700
 four batteries that because neither the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.539
 brings but these batteries logically if 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.310
 they would have stayed in the box 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.810
 originals would have corroded and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.940
 would have pierced the pinche has been the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.430
 box is very good that you take out everything 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.920
 type des and collections and has 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.660
 batteries put on them because the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.700
 batteries are going to run with the step of 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.650
 the years and you're going to damage the system or the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.180
 box where it is highly recommended that 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.230
 Remove the batteries for when you store 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.480
 consoles 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.670
 good as you can see from the front is 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.549
 very father the logo design of the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.900
 quality of nintendo that can not miss 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.340
 here the area part as you can see game 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.049
 boy and the same as in the front 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.540
 here is a logo of a nose 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.640
 playing the style of the virtual boy yo 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 I think here with ccoo peio and creator of 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.870
 this console was inspired to be virtual 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.970
 boy as you can see is the same the background 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.360
 black with red color I believe is in this 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.709
 he focused to get that kind of colors 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 as you can see here on one side brings 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.459
 some games that this one specifically 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.010
 is the mario in front of the first mario in 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.239
 the one that came out of baseball and this one 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.770
 I really do not remember, I think it's from 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.770
 tennis 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.590
 on the other side we see that it brings some 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.850
 attachments like pockets that go 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.460
 in the stomach to save the gameboy 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.420
 this I have never seen them and a battery 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.910
 for rechargeable because I think for the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.610
 console so that you last longer 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.380
 now let's move to the back as 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.330
 You can also see the design is very 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.520
 father from the back to remove the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.290
 fast specifications the brand 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.300
 gameboy and the missing hearing aids 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.650
 I have these well Czech credits, I think 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.840
 that where I can find them are 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.490
 those that I need but for the moment 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.800
 I can go there to put it together 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.180
 completely the console as you can see 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.830
 that this logo nintendo the seal of 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.750
 guarantee again and everything that 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.450
 includes the hearing aids the console and the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.980
 cable link and logically the tetris good 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.240
 I'm going to show them inside 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.280
 so you can see how it is 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.890
 and good friends this is what brings 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.170
 in the console starting we can see 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.210
 that here's the good map pinche is not 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.830
 a map and it's being an advertisement 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.170
 on the one hand and on the other hand well being 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.090
 a map of the metro and everything of gameboy that 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.730
 it's a legendary game as you can see 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.350
 this one looks chingón they gave me until desire 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.300
 of hitting the pinche for him because I think 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.560
 that I have two of these what comes 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.970
 also in the other game boy that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 I showed that they want it so that also 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.470
 but I'm not going to leave it in here 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.450
 I will use it as you can see here in the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.310
 back brings many titles that 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.460
 most of them are chingón is 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.520
 like doctor mario like the super rc 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.280
 prime the one from mario land el kid icarus el 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.810
 metro and two of course the golf that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.170
 is a golf doll that I liked about 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.970
 nintendo and the cleaner as you can see 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.980
 through I show the poster a little bit 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.010
 more closely so that they can see it is 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:47.100
 ok chingón the bastard and logically of 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.320
 nintendo power good we continue as 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.670
 you can see here we have the cartridge that 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.540
 it is included that is the tetris 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.390
 skewer legendary juegazo 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.680
 is with his protector and all the worst that 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.650
 I'll do it but I'll try to see if 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.600
 I can with samantha kim bastard there is 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.370
 so they can see the state in which 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.680
 they are very good 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.540
 here is the cable the link for 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.370
 interconnect the good voice to play 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.990
 of two players I'm not going to take it out 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.370
 because like it's stuck in the background 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.110
 so we better leave it there 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.150
 just as you can see is the 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.430
 point and the other side is the same point 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.990
 and more or less has like a little more 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.670
 half a meter long 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.130
 before showing the console I'm going to 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.200
 show the respective manuals that 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.520
 they come in the box as you can see here 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.380
 is the tetris manual that already 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.810
 I showed earlier 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.210
 here is the console manual 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.190
 logically it's pure cardboard 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.200
 wasted the fuck I never have 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.110
 read in a manual manual of none 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.540
 console and finally the warnings 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.000
 what worse I read them and they come in several 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.880
 languages and they come in Spanish I think that 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.850
 this is German or I do not know what fart and this 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.430
 logically it is English and good as 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.930
 important the console as I had already 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.650
 analyzed I'm just going to show it 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.390
 the state as you can see is in 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.200
 impeccable state where I would give it 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:12.200
 range from 9 to forgiveness from 10 to 1 of 0 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.510
 to 10 rather said a 9 simply 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.340
 is in very good condition I do not give it 10 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.960
 because now I'm going to show you why and 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.960
 it's not because of the console but because 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.790
 it is simply by itself it was damaged not you 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.380
 I'll explain how you can see the 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.030
 opposite is impeccable 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.700
 been up to the main size shines 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.010
 without any rayon has there one 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.420
 minimum as you can see here in the 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.910
 cost as you can see having is very 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.760
 well kept the part of here up 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.620
 where the cartridge goes and the ignition 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.390
 the part of the other side where it goes here 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.510
 the cable the link and where is the volume 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:47.360
 and the bottom part where are the 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.860
 hearing aids that by the way I'm missing the 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.070
 hearing aids and they go here in this building 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.650
 I have them well checked to get in 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.970
 I'll get the box soon 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.400
 and finally the back as 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.990
 can see the detail is this why not 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.970
 I give it 10 as you can see this 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.490
 sticker is damaged but it's not because 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.340
 but by using the time 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.890
 it lost its good its glue and it started 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.680
 to detach on its own so that's what 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.960
 it is inevitable I do not know if you have 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.370
 a similar to these in your box and can 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.690
 see the sticker that little by little is going 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.150
 detaching was wanted to go 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.470
 detaching itself and good friends 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.050
 I already showed you all the inside of the 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.370
 I'm just missing my hearing aids 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.980
 I hope you liked it and that the 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.930
 transported in a good way to the 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.570
 time when the gameboy is going well 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.840
 she was the queen of all good friends we 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.840
 we see
