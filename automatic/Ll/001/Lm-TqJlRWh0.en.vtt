00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.320
 and very good to all I am fury we are going to 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.810
 see this piece of trick that follows 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.060
 running after the last patch 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.669
 they have taken it out, it is divided 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.050
 in two parts because you can stay 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.630
 with the first part that is where 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.769
 we will do a lot of zombies action 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.289
 we can collect the bonuses 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.810
 we will be totally immortal and apart 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.410
 we will have a very fast respawn one of 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.540
 the backups that I've seen on the map and 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 that continues to work until today and 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.559
 apart a second part to be able 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.110
 put up 2 3 and 4 players recommend 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.489
 two players since there are two zones in 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.469
 which we will create this continuation 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.469
 let's proceed to explain the trick 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.890
 for this we must build the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.410
 trampoline as you are watching and coming 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.150
 Here is where the crux REVIVE where 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.950
 It is the bale of straw with teddy 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.960
 to activate the music and you have to 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.000
 place the trampoline between the bale of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.830
 straw and let's say the wall 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.650
 in that way let's say that we have the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.000
 corner just opposite as you can see 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.210
 the trampoline places it and in this way 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.030
 and you allow yourself to push until they put us 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.880
 the trick is a bit complicated you have 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.470
 to try several times until you see 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.210
 that you have crossed the wall and see in 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.800
 the back left the camera free 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.410
 so you can see more or less the position 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.360
 of the trampoline and in this way already 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.790
 we will be totally placed in this 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.130
 in this trick and here I leave the 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.290
 images as you can see that the zombies 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.900
 not only out of the room where 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.640
 is in the wef lives and of the tunnels 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.340
 in front only the zombies are going to 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.350
 come for those two responsbales and 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.300
 we will have a very fast respawn we can 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.700
 get to high rounds in a more 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.810
 quick than in other tricks and as you see 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.690
 all the zombies are left 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.070
 stacked just opposite 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.640
 let's go killing zombies all 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.500
 bonuses 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.510
 the zombies that we killed are a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.300
 taste as close to us as we can 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.280
 collect the bonuses and as you see 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.110
 Here I am teaching you the responsibility 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 lamented before from the quid room 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.510
 rival and from just opposite is now the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 second way let's say that up there 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.970
 it would be the trick we say to you explained if 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.140
 you want to get with another partner 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.330
 when the first player has already gotten 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.830
 it is simply driven is with the tail 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.870
 paralyzing up to fly 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.750
 until you see that we say that you 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.160
 you can move freely on the map 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.290
 until you get to let's say to the area 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.640
 dark that is where it is in the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.800
 bales of straw these locations 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.690
 just opposite is where we have 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.780
 put us with the teddy bear just 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.850
 on the other side we will be where you are 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.230
 the player right now is worth and as you see 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.269
 instead of going all the zombies over there 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.430
 and all the zombies will come here and 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.400
 here and this would be the second lot 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.950
 action in this way the with this 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.300
 player in this position the the other 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.100
 player the second player what 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.530
 would have to do is mess with the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.600
 trampoline in the first place as yes 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.739
 explained at the beginning of the video as 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.980
 that has been everything I hope that I have 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.140
 liked to give you the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.209
 Subscribe to comment what you want and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.390
 see you in the next video until the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.390
 next
