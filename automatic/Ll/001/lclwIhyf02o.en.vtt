okay<00:00:03.449> astronomy<00:00:04.049> here<00:00:04.290> we<00:00:04.380> go<00:00:04.529> we're<00:00:04.740> ready

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay astronomy here we go we're ready

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.230 
okay astronomy here we go we're ready
for<00:00:04.950> astronomy<00:00:05.580> let's<00:00:05.910> do<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:08.059> this<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
for astronomy let's do it this is a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.759 
for astronomy let's do it this is a
little<00:00:09.420> weird<00:00:09.570> which<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> solar

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
little weird which one is the solar

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.890 
little weird which one is the solar
eclipse<00:00:11.099> possible<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.120> hope<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.420> guys<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.750> see

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
eclipse possible I hope you guys can see

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
eclipse possible I hope you guys can see
this<00:00:13.110> solar<00:00:13.500> eclipse<00:00:14.059> whatever's<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
this solar eclipse whatever's in the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.540 
this solar eclipse whatever's in the
phrase<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.870> mean<00:00:16.320> duh<00:00:16.529> that's<00:00:17.190> what's<00:00:17.430> being

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
phrase is mean duh that's what's being

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.429 
phrase is mean duh that's what's being
blocked<00:00:17.970> out<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.270> Sun<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.810> being<00:00:18.990> blocked<00:00:19.199> out

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
blocked out the Sun is being blocked out

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.840 
blocked out the Sun is being blocked out
by<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.619> moon<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.100> moon<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
by the moon so the moon is to be in the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.400 
by the moon so the moon is to be in the
way<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.570> would<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.750> be

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
way what would that be

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.490 
way what would that be
let<00:00:23.189> me<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.609> right<00:00:23.910> here<00:00:24.230> that<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> where

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
let me this right here that is where

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.179 
let me this right here that is where
solar<00:00:25.859> eclipse<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.750> possible<00:00:30.980> okay<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.130> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
solar eclipse is possible okay what I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.639 
solar eclipse is possible okay what I
was<00:00:32.279> doing<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:33.440> I'm<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.559> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
was doing with this one I'm going to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
was doing with this one I'm going to
skip<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.360> don't<00:00:36.360> worry<00:00:36.510> about<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:38.760> it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
skip this don't worry about it this it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.150 
skip this don't worry about it this it
shows<00:00:39.690> well<00:00:40.260> we've<00:00:40.500> got<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
shows well we've got this is the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.200 
shows well we've got this is the
spectral<00:00:41.760> lines<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:43.850> spectral<00:00:44.850> lines<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.090> an

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
spectral lines of spectral lines of an

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.770 
spectral lines of spectral lines of an
element<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.079> stationary<00:00:46.969> what<00:00:47.969> when<00:00:48.690> an

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
element that is stationary what when an

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.690 
element that is stationary what when an
element<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> spectral<00:00:49.950> lines<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.520> like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
element the spectral lines look like

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.160 
element the spectral lines look like
coming<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.210> space<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:51.780> everything<00:00:52.079> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
coming from space well everything is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
coming from space well everything is
basically<00:00:52.350> moving<00:00:52.559> away<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.160> us<00:00:53.250> because<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
basically moving away from us because of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.319 
basically moving away from us because of
the<00:00:53.730> Big<00:00:53.879> Bang

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the Big Bang

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.000 
the Big Bang
so<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:54.870> LA<00:00:55.140> should<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.530> shifted<00:00:55.680> towards

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so these LA should be shifted towards

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.700 
so these LA should be shifted towards
its<00:00:56.219> own<00:00:56.309> red<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.449> red<00:00:57.480> side<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.260> final<00:00:58.620> but

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
its own red the red side not final but

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
its own red the red side not final but
red<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> your<00:00:59.879> answer<00:01:00.059> things<00:01:00.449> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
red so this is your answer things in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
red so this is your answer things in
space<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:00.960> move<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> away<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
space there move it away because the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.500 
space there move it away because the
spectra<00:01:02.609> lines<00:01:02.820> are<00:01:02.969> shifted<00:01:03.090> towards<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
spectra lines are shifted towards the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.870 
spectra lines are shifted towards the
red<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> very<00:01:04.500> least<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.640> also

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
red at the very least know that and also

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.390 
red at the very least know that and also
know<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.479> Ray's<00:01:06.720> redshift<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
know you see this Ray's redshift that is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.270 
know you see this Ray's redshift that is

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
evidence the universe is expanding

here<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.909> okay<00:01:27.210> let's<00:01:27.630> say<00:01:28.039> this<00:01:29.039> is<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
here we go okay let's say this is the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.649 
here we go okay let's say this is the
earth<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.000> moon<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.360> different<00:01:32.659> different

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
earth the moon at different different

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
earth the moon at different different
locations<00:01:34.289> in<00:01:34.380> its<00:01:34.590> revolution<00:01:35.520> around<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
locations in its revolution around the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.929 
locations in its revolution around the
Sun<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.990> say<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.829> ask<00:01:38.070> what<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.789> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
Sun what say you they ask what is the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819 
Sun what say you they ask what is the
moon<00:01:39.149> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.539> look<00:01:39.719> like<00:01:39.929> for<00:01:40.380> an<00:01:40.500> observer

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
moon going to look like for an observer

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.929 
moon going to look like for an observer
on<00:01:41.070> earth<00:01:41.369> when<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> moon<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:42.869> sea<00:01:43.880> this<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
on earth when the moon is at sea this is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.880 
on earth when the moon is at sea this is
why<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> teach<00:01:45.509> people<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.740> see

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
why I teach people do it I don't see

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.219 
why I teach people do it I don't see
enough<00:01:47.100> kids<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.819> doing<00:01:48.179> it<00:01:48.270> draw<00:01:48.869> this

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
enough kids actually doing it draw this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
enough kids actually doing it draw this
on<00:01:49.530> your<00:01:49.710> paper<00:01:49.829> it'll<00:01:50.250> help<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.789> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
on your paper it'll help you get it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.609 
on your paper it'll help you get it
right<00:01:51.090> okay<00:01:51.360> let's<00:01:51.929> see<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.350> does<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.500> look

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
right okay let's see what does it look

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.809 
right okay let's see what does it look
like<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.069> draw<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> friend<00:01:53.610> right

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
like I'm going to draw a friend right

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.240 
like I'm going to draw a friend right
there<00:01:54.119> there's<00:01:54.810> Fred<00:01:55.110> looking<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.710> what

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there there's Fred looking up at it what

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.889 
there there's Fred looking up at it what
does<00:01:56.310> he<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.670> could<00:01:57.119> he<00:01:57.179> see<00:01:57.390> someone<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
does he see could he see someone on this

the<00:03:58.620> color<00:03:58.859> baby<00:03:59.129> was<00:03:59.370> until<00:03:59.819> it's<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.180> white

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
the color baby was until it's a white

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.170 
the color baby was until it's a white
star<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:02.370> what<00:04:02.489> would<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.639> temperature<00:04:03.060> be

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
star and what would the temperature be

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.300 
star and what would the temperature be
well<00:04:03.389> this<00:04:03.479> is<00:04:03.629> 10,000<00:04:04.290> 5f<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.769> little<00:04:05.129> less

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
well this is 10,000 5f a little less

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.909 
well this is 10,000 5f a little less
than<00:04:05.519> 10,000<00:04:06.239> maybe<00:04:06.530> 9500<00:04:07.530> let<00:04:07.620> me<00:04:07.680> go<00:04:07.799> back

and write that in color what did I say

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.550 
and write that in color what did I say
white<00:04:10.699> temperature<00:04:12.049> let's<00:04:13.049> say<00:04:13.290> around

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
white temperature let's say around

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.699 
white temperature let's say around
ninety<00:04:14.489> nine<00:04:15.329> thousand<00:04:16.169> five<00:04:16.349> hundred

degrees<00:04:17.400> C<00:04:17.780> which<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:19.669> hot

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.650 

maybe<00:04:23.920> now<00:04:24.100> her<00:04:24.250> star<00:04:24.550> but<00:04:25.000> for<00:04:25.180> view<00:04:25.420> and<00:04:25.570> I

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
maybe now her star but for view and I

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.690 
maybe now her star but for view and I
that's<00:04:26.110> unbelievably<00:04:26.800> hot<00:04:26.980> unbelievable

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
that's unbelievably hot unbelievable

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.720 
that's unbelievably hot unbelievable
this<00:04:28.510> question<00:04:28.960> what<00:04:29.590> do<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.710> got<00:04:29.890> it<00:04:30.040> this

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
this question what do I got it this

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.860 
this question what do I got it this
question<00:04:31.090> talk

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
question talk

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.110 
question talk
it's<00:04:32.470> bigger<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.130> highest<00:04:33.640> tides<00:04:33.880> on<00:04:34.090> earth

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
it's bigger the highest tides on earth

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.750 
it's bigger the highest tides on earth
are<00:04:34.630> going<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.870> occur<00:04:35.280> when<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.400> moon<00:04:36.580> is

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
are going to occur when the moon is

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.090 
are going to occur when the moon is
there<00:04:36.880> look<00:04:37.030> what<00:04:37.330> positions<00:04:37.930> high<00:04:38.320> tide<00:04:38.650> so

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
there look what positions high tide so

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.100 
there look what positions high tide so
here's<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.490> Sun<00:04:39.820> here's<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.330> moon<00:04:40.540> you

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
here's the Sun here's the moon you

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.230 
here's the Sun here's the moon you
needed<00:04:41.410> high<00:04:41.590> tides<00:04:41.920> also<00:04:42.340> called<00:04:42.580> spring

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
needed high tides also called spring

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.170 
needed high tides also called spring
tide<00:04:43.510> when<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.880> gravitational<00:04:45.880> pull<00:04:46.000> of<00:04:46.060> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
tide when the gravitational pull of the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.370 
tide when the gravitational pull of the
Sun<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.230> moon<00:04:47.260> work<00:04:48.040> together<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:49.380> when

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
Sun and the moon work together so when

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.930 
Sun and the moon work together so when
they're<00:04:50.530> kind<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:51.040> a<00:04:51.400> straight<00:04:51.700> line<00:04:51.910> so

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
they're kind of in a straight line so

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.960 
they're kind of in a straight line so
it's<00:04:52.270> going<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.420> be<00:04:52.570> at<00:04:52.690> three<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.730> one<00:04:54.730> you're

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
it's going to be at three and one you're

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.130 
it's going to be at three and one you're
going<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.120> have<00:04:55.180> those<00:04:55.330> really<00:04:55.600> high<00:04:55.900> high

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
going to have those really high high

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.840 
going to have those really high high
tides<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.680> it's<00:04:56.800> really<00:04:57.010> low<00:04:57.250> low<00:04:57.550> tides

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
tides and it's really low low tides

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.490 
tides and it's really low low tides
because<00:04:58.060> they<00:04:58.180> gravity<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.900> all<00:04:59.020> working<00:04:59.290> in

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
because they gravity it's all working in

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.190 
because they gravity it's all working in
a<00:04:59.590> line<00:04:59.800> and<00:05:00.480> know<00:05:01.480> that<00:05:01.660> it's<00:05:01.810> called<00:05:01.900> spring

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
a line and know that it's called spring

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.030 
a line and know that it's called spring
tides<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.960> kind<00:05:05.140> of<00:05:05.200> shows<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.830> like

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
tides and this kind of shows it I like

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.800 
tides and this kind of shows it I like
this<00:05:06.160> this<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.610> shows<00:05:06.880> that<00:05:07.450> we<00:05:07.570> hit<00:05:07.720> the

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
this this kind of shows that we hit the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.130 
this this kind of shows that we hit the
moon<00:05:08.020> here<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:09.030> in<00:05:10.030> line<00:05:10.240> with<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.480> Sun<00:05:10.720> you

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
moon here and in line with the Sun you

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.080 
moon here and in line with the Sun you
look<00:05:11.350> at<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.560> have<00:05:11.590> your<00:05:12.130> high<00:05:12.280> tide<00:05:12.610> kind<00:05:12.940> of

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
look at you have your high tide kind of

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.210 
look at you have your high tide kind of
hot<00:05:13.870> guys<00:05:14.050> here<00:05:14.080> my<00:05:14.410> dad's<00:05:14.620> here<00:05:14.770> low<00:05:14.980> tides

pendulum<00:05:44.029> remember<00:05:44.539> that<00:05:44.689> video<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.050> showed

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
pendulum remember that video I showed

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.619 
pendulum remember that video I showed
that<00:05:45.409> video<00:05:45.759> which<00:05:46.759> I<00:05:46.849> think<00:05:47.029> really<00:05:47.270> really

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
that video which I think really really

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.170 
that video which I think really really
showed<00:05:48.259> it<00:05:48.409> quite<00:05:48.740> well<00:05:48.949> what<00:05:49.639> is<00:05:49.759> it<00:05:49.879> you<00:05:49.999> see

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
showed it quite well what is it you see

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.670 
showed it quite well what is it you see
Foucault's<00:05:50.539> Pendulum<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.319> basically<00:05:51.560> the

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
Foucault's Pendulum and basically the

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.709 
Foucault's Pendulum and basically the
pendulum<00:05:52.069> stays<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.520> same<00:05:52.699> motion<00:05:52.909> it

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
pendulum stays in the same motion it

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:56.140 
pendulum stays in the same motion it
looks<00:05:53.779> like<00:05:54.169> it<00:05:54.319> moves<00:05:54.560> and<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:55.029> reason<00:05:56.029> is

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
looks like it moves and the reason is

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.659 
looks like it moves and the reason is
because<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.749> room<00:05:57.289> the<00:05:57.680> earth<00:05:57.889> is<00:05:58.189> rotating

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
because the room the earth is rotating

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.719 
because the room the earth is rotating
beneath<00:05:59.449> it<00:05:59.659> mind<00:06:00.289> blowing<00:06:00.949> but<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.490> see

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
beneath it mind blowing but you see

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.670 
beneath it mind blowing but you see
Foucault<00:06:02.180> pendulum<00:06:02.509> Foucault<00:06:03.080> pendulum<00:06:03.349> is

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
Foucault pendulum Foucault pendulum is

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.839 
Foucault pendulum Foucault pendulum is
proof<00:06:03.949> or<00:06:04.279> evidence<00:06:04.490> that<00:06:06.400> proof<00:06:07.400> Earth

proof or evidence that proof Earth
rotates<00:06:09.339> chance<00:06:10.339> of<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.610> being<00:06:10.819> a<00:06:10.879> question

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
rotates chance of the being a question

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.809 
rotates chance of the being a question
about<00:06:11.389> birth<00:06:11.870> rotating<00:06:12.620> is<00:06:12.740> very<00:06:13.099> hot<00:06:13.339> not

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
about birth rotating is very hot not

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.179 
about birth rotating is very hot not
sure<00:06:13.999> why<00:06:14.210> your<00:06:15.199> state<00:06:15.469> loves<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.830> proof<00:06:16.039> of

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:16.189 
sure why your state loves the proof of

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.329 
sure why your state loves the proof of
the<00:06:16.339> earth<00:06:17.330> rotating<00:06:17.839> stuff<00:06:18.139> they<00:06:18.319> love<00:06:18.529> it<00:06:18.710> so

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
the earth rotating stuff they love it so

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:20.769 
the earth rotating stuff they love it so
between<00:06:19.639> Foucault<00:06:20.270> pendulum<00:06:20.479> and<00:06:20.689> have

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
between Foucault pendulum and have

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.769 
between Foucault pendulum and have
another<00:06:20.960> one<00:06:21.169> oh<00:06:21.729> I<00:06:22.729> think<00:06:22.999> I<00:06:23.150> have<00:06:23.240> it<00:06:23.360> in<00:06:23.419> the

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:23.779 
another one oh I think I have it in the

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.879 
another one oh I think I have it in the
other<00:06:23.960> one<00:06:25.029> would<00:06:26.029> be<00:06:26.270> other<00:06:27.020> evidence<00:06:27.379> that

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
other one would be other evidence that

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:28.929 
other one would be other evidence that
proof<00:06:28.069> rotates<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:28.550> then<00:06:28.639> people<00:06:28.849> are

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:28.939 
proof rotates and then people are

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.149 
proof rotates and then people are
jumping<00:06:29.089> up<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.330> down<00:06:29.419> saying<00:06:29.689> right<00:06:29.960> now<00:06:30.159> not

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
jumping up and down saying right now not

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:36.429 
jumping up and down saying right now not
as<00:06:31.249> exciting<00:06:31.729> is<00:06:31.909> this<00:06:34.210> Coriolis<00:06:35.210> effect<00:06:35.659> that

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
as exciting is this Coriolis effect that

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.159 
as exciting is this Coriolis effect that
is<00:06:36.560> how<00:06:36.680> winds<00:06:37.009> curve<00:06:37.580> on<00:06:37.939> earth<00:06:38.360> Coriolis

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
is how winds curve on earth Coriolis

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.649 
is how winds curve on earth Coriolis
effect<00:06:39.379> is<00:06:39.469> also<00:06:39.979> proof<00:06:40.279> Earth<00:06:40.669> rotates<00:06:41.149> not

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
effect is also proof Earth rotates not

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.629 
effect is also proof Earth rotates not
as<00:06:41.779> excited<00:06:42.229> as<00:06:42.349> this<00:06:42.500> no<00:06:43.159> that<00:06:43.370> as<00:06:43.490> well

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
as excited as this no that as well

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.860 
as excited as this no that as well
however

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.469 

we're<00:06:50.870> going<00:06:50.990> to<00:06:51.050> stop<00:06:51.199> right<00:06:51.229> there<00:06:51.680> here<00:06:52.479> I'm

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
we're going to stop right there here I'm

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.429 
we're going to stop right there here I'm
going<00:06:53.599> to<00:06:53.659> stop<00:06:53.780> right<00:06:53.930> there<00:06:54.050> and<00:06:54.229> see<00:06:54.349> you

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
going to stop right there and see you

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.149 
going to stop right there and see you
next<00:06:54.650> episode<00:06:54.860> which<00:06:55.610> I<00:06:55.789> bet<00:06:55.999> is<00:06:56.120> going<00:06:56.270> to<00:06:56.330> be

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
next episode which I bet is going to be

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:00.339 
next episode which I bet is going to be
geologic<00:06:58.159> history<00:06:58.249> probably<00:06:59.110> seen<00:07:00.110> a<00:07:00.139> little

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
geologic history probably seen a little

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.529 
geologic history probably seen a little
bit
