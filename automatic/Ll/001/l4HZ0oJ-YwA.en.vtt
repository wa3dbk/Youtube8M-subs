cheap<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> did<00:03:34.250> not<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.700> money<00:03:34.880> for

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
cheap and I did not have the money for

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.070 
cheap and I did not have the money for
$800<00:03:36.680> hinges<00:03:37.160> but<00:03:37.450> yeah<00:03:38.450> it's<00:03:38.660> kind<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.900> just

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
$800 hinges but yeah it's kind of just

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.830 
$800 hinges but yeah it's kind of just
like<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.950> overview<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:41.090> mean<00:03:41.780> it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
like the overview of that I mean it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.780 
like the overview of that I mean it
looks<00:03:42.019> super<00:03:42.380> cool<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.250> know<00:03:43.400> my<00:03:43.580> cars

kind<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.150> ripped<00:03:44.330> apart<00:03:44.450> right<00:03:44.780> now<00:03:44.989> and<00:03:45.230> I

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
kind of ripped apart right now and I

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.560 
kind of ripped apart right now and I
don't<00:03:46.549> really<00:03:46.820> ask<00:03:47.060> them<00:03:47.299> it's<00:03:47.450> done

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
don't really ask them it's done

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.500 
don't really ask them it's done
hopefully<00:03:47.810> if<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.560> does<00:03:48.920> get<00:03:49.340> done<00:03:49.610> oh<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.360> what

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
hopefully if it does get done oh so what

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.600 
hopefully if it does get done oh so what
I'm<00:03:50.600> probably<00:03:50.780> gonna<00:03:51.080> have<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.410> do<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:52.070> like

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
I'm probably gonna have to do is like

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.509 
I'm probably gonna have to do is like
end<00:03:52.850> up<00:03:53.019> getting<00:03:54.019> a<00:03:54.110> cut<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:55.310> something

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
end up getting a cut of like something

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.150 
end up getting a cut of like something
to<00:03:55.670> cut<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.209> off<00:03:56.570> I'm<00:03:57.410> thinking<00:03:57.830> but<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:57.980> don't

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
to cut this off I'm thinking but I don't

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.530 
to cut this off I'm thinking but I don't
like<00:03:58.250> doing<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:58.670> because<00:03:58.790> I'm<00:03:59.150> getting<00:03:59.299> rid

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
like doing that because I'm getting rid

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.600 
like doing that because I'm getting rid
of<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.720> metal<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.950> know<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.100> kind<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.430> need

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
of the metal and you know I kind of need

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.350 
of the metal and you know I kind of need
it<00:04:02.260> for<00:04:03.260> support<00:04:03.739> but<00:04:04.010> yeah<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.670> end<00:04:04.970> up<00:04:05.209> just

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
it for support but yeah I end up just

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.820 
it for support but yeah I end up just
grinding<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.870> off<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.380> then<00:04:06.500> hopefully

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
grinding that off and then hopefully

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.789 
grinding that off and then hopefully

come<00:04:41.639> out<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:41.970> in<00:04:42.180> but<00:04:42.720> then<00:04:42.870> again<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.169> had<00:04:43.380> to

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
come out and in but then again I had to

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.020

other concern above all how these other

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.330 
other concern above all how these other
ones<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:48.290> it's<00:04:49.290> probably<00:04:49.590> gonna<00:04:49.919> hit<00:04:50.310> that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
ones like it's probably gonna hit that

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.280 
ones like it's probably gonna hit that
because<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:50.910> comes<00:04:51.060> out<00:04:51.180> so<00:04:51.240> far<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.930> don't<00:04:52.080> know
