clearing<00:02:48.010> this<00:02:48.220> area<00:02:48.400> out<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:50.260> going

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
clearing this area out and we're going

clearing this area out and we're going
to<00:02:50.620> be<00:02:50.859> making<00:02:51.159> this<00:02:51.280> sort<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.730> community

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
to be making this sort of a community

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.240 
to be making this sort of a community
area<00:02:52.629> that<00:02:52.959> way<00:02:53.139> we<00:02:53.319> can<00:02:53.470> all<00:02:53.650> kind<00:02:53.859> of<00:02:53.950> build

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
area that way we can all kind of build

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.940 
area that way we can all kind of build
here<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.609> have<00:02:54.760> like<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.939> spawn<00:02:55.359> town<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.109> all

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
here and have like a spawn town and all

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.289 
here and have like a spawn town and all
that<00:02:57.129> good<00:02:57.280> stuff<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.670> think<00:02:57.909> we<00:02:58.030> will<00:02:58.120> have

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
that good stuff I think we will have

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.089 
that good stuff I think we will have
separate<00:02:58.810> bases<00:02:59.139> as<00:02:59.290> well<00:02:59.319> but<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.739> think<00:02:59.799> the

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
separate bases as well but I think the

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.909 
separate bases as well but I think the
whole<00:03:00.340> idea<00:03:00.819> between<00:03:01.389> this<00:03:01.840> series<00:03:02.260> compared

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
whole idea between this series compared

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.429 
whole idea between this series compared
to<00:03:03.040> FCB<00:03:03.340> was<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:04.739> collab<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:06.099> much<00:03:06.760> as<00:03:07.030> possible

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
to FCB was a collab as much as possible

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.599 
to FCB was a collab as much as possible
get<00:03:08.439> everyone<00:03:08.799> working<00:03:08.980> together<00:03:09.189> on

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
get everyone working together on

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.619 
get everyone working together on
different<00:03:09.939> projects<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:10.569> stuff<00:03:10.840> indeed

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
different projects and stuff indeed

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.599 
different projects and stuff indeed
that's<00:03:13.629> pretty<00:03:13.870> much<00:03:14.019> this<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.889> don't<00:03:15.220> know<00:03:15.400> I

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
that's pretty much this I don't know I

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.159 
that's pretty much this I don't know I
guess<00:03:15.849> other<00:03:16.150> people<00:03:16.269> have<00:03:16.629> probably<00:03:16.840> moved

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
guess other people have probably moved

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.800 
guess other people have probably moved
on<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.560> kind<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.159> built<00:03:18.419> places<00:03:19.419> of<00:03:19.540> their<00:03:19.629> own

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
on and kind of built places of their own

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.330 
on and kind of built places of their own
cuz<00:03:20.109> I<00:03:20.349> thought<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.739> place<00:03:20.859> would<00:03:21.099> have<00:03:21.250> been

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
cuz I thought that place would have been

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.879 
cuz I thought that place would have been
more<00:03:21.579> developed<00:03:22.569> than<00:03:22.629> it<00:03:22.870> was<00:03:23.019> yeah<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.530> kind

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
more developed than it was yeah I kind

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.530 
more developed than it was yeah I kind
of<00:03:23.980> signed<00:03:24.220> on<00:03:24.400> I'm<00:03:24.609> like<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.000> still<00:03:25.329> looks

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
of signed on I'm like it still looks

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.469 
of signed on I'm like it still looks
like<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:25.930> 14th<00:03:26.349> century<00:03:26.859> oh<00:03:27.459> yeah<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.329> my

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
anything but I think the my focus this

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.620 
anything but I think the my focus this
season<00:06:43.060> because<00:06:43.389> last<00:06:43.599> season<00:06:43.959> was<00:06:44.139> like

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
CPU

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.410 
CPU
yeah<00:07:01.100> there's<00:07:01.340> unless<00:07:01.730> that's<00:07:01.910> a<00:07:02.030> part<00:07:02.240> of<00:07:02.330> it

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420
