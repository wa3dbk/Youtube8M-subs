in<00:06:05.700> poo<00:06:06.200> as<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:07.500> can<00:06:07.650> see<00:06:07.890> we<00:06:08.280> switched<00:06:08.670> that

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
in poo as you can see we switched that

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.160 
in poo as you can see we switched that
fast<00:06:09.900> we<00:06:10.410> didn't<00:06:10.710> have<00:06:10.890> to<00:06:11.070> go<00:06:11.520> on<00:06:11.910> quit<00:06:12.870> and

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
fast we didn't have to go on quit and

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.300 
fast we didn't have to go on quit and
then<00:06:13.350> go<00:06:13.590> back<00:06:13.860> in<00:06:14.190> try<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.150> find<00:06:15.750> that<00:06:16.040> map<00:06:17.040> and

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
then go back in try to find that map and

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.560 
then go back in try to find that map and
join<00:06:17.670> it<00:06:17.850> just<00:06:18.570> does<00:06:18.840> it<00:06:19.050> instantly<00:06:19.920> so<00:06:20.570> this

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
join it just does it instantly so this

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.840 
join it just does it instantly so this
is<00:06:21.720> pretty<00:06:21.990> much<00:06:22.140> it<00:06:22.530> for<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.190> toomanyitems

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850
