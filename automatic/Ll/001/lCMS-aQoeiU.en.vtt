00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.219
 Hello everyone, my name is Fabio Lima. 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.349
 starting another video here for the series 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.389
 of tutorials on windows 8 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.490
 in fact this video that would be the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.990
 first video there but I ended up 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.400
 letting pass this feature is about the a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.830
 upgrade from windows 7 to 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.279
 windows 8 so I'll show you here 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.740
 I'm just because I started here right? 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.090
 we already know that we are on windows 7 with 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.359
 Version windows 7 ultimate version that 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.250
 that I have always used is still not yet 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.399
 quit windows 7 I'm with one 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.079
 dual boot system to power me 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.960
 to better still improve windows 8 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.089
 still does not dispense with windows 7 is because 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.879
 is a very recent Microsoft release 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.559
 then this course this course is that I am 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.600
 preparing and casting daily for 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.210
 You are an introductory course for you. 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.829
 get used to know windows 8 no 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.579
 I'm recommending that the staff leave. 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.379
 face for windows 8 is going ok 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.729
 show the feature here that actually is 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.549
 a test for you to check the 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.620
 compatibility of your windows 7 with 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.410
 the features of windows 8 then also 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.310
 with soft view launch saa 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.470
 it makes available the taxpayer 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.610
 wizard is that now windows 8 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.210
 assistant role 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.520
 let's run and here and software it does 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.650
 scan from your computer and see 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.300
 what is compatible and what is not like me 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.150
 I already had a previous marriage 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.980
 He's going to be very fast here, but he 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.380
 It will be a long time here it will turn out well. 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.960
 quick but for you guys will run 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.130
 first time it will take a quite 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 how much I have here? 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.640
 Strawberry about eight to ten minutes 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 it already has a list of what is compatible 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.290
 do not stay on the saved blog 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.830
 he informs me that I have 68 of my 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.780
 available applications are compatible 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.680
 68 applications and devices 14 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.600
 need revision then we can 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.600
 see here compatibility list 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.200
 as I said the inÃ¡ in some classes already the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 video gags no longer supported 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.760
 with windows 8 the sidebar of the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.350
 windows is no longer compatible 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.730
 so by taking some things 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.819
 need to be reviewed 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.530
 the available solution it informs that the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.830
 Everything is not available for you 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.000
 is not supported informs that oracle has 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.810
 available solution 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.090
 some things in a way that is possible 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.530
 to solve which I sang studio 7 is already in 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.780
 version 8 but you still have it installed here 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.590
 informs you that you need to install it on the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.600
 windows 8 it does here in an analysis 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.570
 It takes a while for me to form all of it. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.459
 here than what is compatible with the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.319
 my future version of windows 8 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.080
 Do you remember that this is software 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.850
 test for you to upgrade from 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.830
 from here you can also upgrade 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.050
 but you can simply do the test 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.200
 cancel does not mean it's just going to do 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.600
 obligatorily yours to upgrade 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.540
 for windows 8 here also a series 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.830
 tools here that 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.670
 are compatible 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.290
 is this applications here I can take 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.250
 for my to windows 8 if I do 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.630
 the ticket will not let us move here 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.220
 Let's say I'm going to upgrade 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.930
 show step by step but because I do not 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.400
 I'll finish the process process there. 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.760
 ends in a purchase 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.920
 who chooses what you want to keep 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.600
 so here it is is an important part 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.450
 as it was already questioned whether it 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.010
 keeps the files and programs 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.850
 you want to keep only the files 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.190
 personal 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.170
 he will keep people and will clean 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.109
 the entire installation of programs 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.880
 programs and drivers is not available 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.549
 will install everything compatible from the 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.150
 windows 8 and nothing if you want to do 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.230
 general formatting I do not recommend 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.750
 so let's go to the windows settings 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.030
 personal files and applications 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.650
 we will then advance from that 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.810
 Way to buy part I'm there. 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 really do not think it's good to do 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.430
 this upgrade because 69 reais for you 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.730
 get the original version of windows 8 pro 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.819
 it is worth taking into consideration the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.160
 of absurd prices, which are the 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.400
 windows prices even more one 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.840
 part of your launch is pretty cool 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.310
 remembering who to do it here 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.290
 can only probably do so until the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.549
 January 31 to make this update 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.350
 for that price 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.720
 according to microsoft own brand this 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.870
 mp is available until January 31 for 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.070
 This price is so go from here. 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.840
 can I request it by clicking the 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.310
 request that you already give me two options here 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.800
 Why God for giving me the DVD here? 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.990
 windows 32 real dvd because it can 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.290
 send a dvd also from here I 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.419
 I can register and request that 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.040
 be delivered at my residence two 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.410
 digital download games like me 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.940
 I spoke in the introductory class to the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.050
 windows is how it has been greatly reduced 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.780
 also optimized 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.510
 the setap neel the image iso let's say so 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.840
 the setup of windows 8 has around 2 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.080
 gb 300're here then we have - other 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.520
 myself I can I chose here to do 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.050
 digital download but also want to 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.960
 windows dvd media 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.139
 let's go pay it will start a 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.139
 process 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.490
 Okay, the billing address then 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.710
 from here I will not go any further because 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.360
 he asks me to put my data 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.510
 mail address here 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.910
 and has the option that thousands of 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.120
 delivery is the same then the match that 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.030
 if you want to upgrade it is low 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.740
 windows 8 upgrade assistant is only 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.910
 google search this will fall straight 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.930
 result will fall on the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.470
 test just out of curiosity to know if 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.690
 it 's worth it or not the upgrade is 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.460
