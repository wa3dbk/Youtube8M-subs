00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay here we are 2003 Nissan Altima how

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.920 
okay here we are 2003 Nissan Altima how
to<00:00:03.179> code<00:00:03.449> -<00:00:04.520> bad<00:00:05.520> crankshaft<00:00:06.450> position<00:00:06.629> sensor

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
to code - bad crankshaft position sensor

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.430 
to code - bad crankshaft position sensor
so<00:00:07.710> first<00:00:08.189> thing<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.460> do<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:09.320> first<00:00:10.320> thing

so first thing you do here first thing
you<00:00:10.530> do<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.980> disconnect<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> negative

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
you do is and disconnect the negative

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.180 
you do is and disconnect the negative
terminal<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.420> battery<00:00:12.860> second<00:00:13.860> wait<00:00:14.009> for

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
terminal on the battery second wait for

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.740 
terminal on the battery second wait for
the<00:00:14.250> engine<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.759> cold<00:00:15.030> okay

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the engine to be cold okay

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.630 
the engine to be cold okay
that's<00:00:15.960> pretty<00:00:16.199> important<00:00:16.650> take<00:00:17.220> off<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
that's pretty important take off the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.960 
that's pretty important take off the
plastic<00:00:17.940> cover<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.320> air<00:00:19.580> box<00:00:20.580> thing

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
plastic cover and the air box thing

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
plastic cover and the air box thing
that's<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> way<00:00:22.289> okay<00:00:22.619> then<00:00:23.430> what

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
see my hands here yeah see where I had

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.139 
see my hands here yeah see where I had
this<00:00:37.760> okay<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:40.100> here<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:43.020> sensor<00:00:43.620> is

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
this okay in here here the sensor is

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.410 
this okay in here here the sensor is
this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.680> okay<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.300> could

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this is right here okay if you could

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
this is right here okay if you could
really<00:00:48.570> tell<00:00:48.899> exactly<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:49.950> follow<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> wire

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really tell exactly but follow the wire

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.209 
really tell exactly but follow the wire
you'll<00:00:51.449> feel<00:00:51.690> around<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:52.980> too

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you'll feel around there if you get too

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.470 
you'll feel around there if you get too
high<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.579> top<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> engine<00:00:54.000> you'll<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.420> able

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
high on top of the engine you'll be able

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.250 
high on top of the engine you'll be able
to<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to see this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.930 
to see this
I<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.340> eyes<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.730> can't

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I could see it with my eyes I can't

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.220 
I could see it with my eyes I can't
really<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> with<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> camera<00:00:58.079> here

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
really just get it with the camera here

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
really just get it with the camera here
for<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:59.250> that's<00:00:59.370> where<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> right

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
for you but that's where it is right

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.160 
for you but that's where it is right
there<00:01:00.300> crankshaft<00:01:01.050> position<00:01:01.680> sensor<00:01:02.039> ah

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
there crankshaft position sensor ah

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.039 
there crankshaft position sensor ah
basically<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:05.790> job<00:01:06.060> once<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.570> follow<00:01:06.810> these

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
basically this job once you follow these

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
basically this job once you follow these
instructions<00:01:07.189> should<00:01:08.189> really<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.640> about<00:01:08.909> 20

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
instructions should really take about 20

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
instructions should really take about 20
minutes<00:01:09.570> no<00:01:09.750> longer<00:01:10.170> took<00:01:10.830> me<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> long<00:01:11.250> while

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
minutes no longer took me a long while

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.260 
minutes no longer took me a long while
to<00:01:11.939> actually<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.930> point<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:14.549> lot

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
to actually get this to this point a lot

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.899 
to actually get this to this point a lot
of<00:01:15.390> fumbling<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:15.840> watching<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:16.590> videos

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
of fumbling around watching other videos

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
of fumbling around watching other videos

mean<00:01:23.009> once<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.670> take<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.299> old<00:01:24.680> thing<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
mean once you take this old thing out is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
mean once you take this old thing out is
the<00:01:27.150> old<00:01:27.270> sensors<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> look

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the old sensors but it's going to look

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
the old sensors but it's going to look
like<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.470> original<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.189> got<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> connect

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
like the original one you got to connect

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.600 
like the original one you got to connect
the<00:01:30.689> wiring<00:01:31.259> harness<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.950> before<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the wiring harness to it before you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
the wiring harness to it before you
actually<00:01:32.790> screw<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually screw it and on this one you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.370 
actually screw it and on this one you
have<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> disconnect<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.659> wiring<00:01:36.869> harness

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
have to disconnect the wiring harness

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
have to disconnect the wiring harness
first<00:01:37.740> before<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> could<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.000> bolt

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
first before you could take this bolt

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
first before you could take this bolt
out<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.979> actual<00:01:41.400> wiring

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
out just the way the the actual wiring

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
out just the way the the actual wiring
harness<00:01:42.329> fits<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.810> when<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> put<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.320> in

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
harness fits but when you put it back in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.830 
harness fits but when you put it back in
on<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> new<00:01:44.040> one<00:01:44.270> you're<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> connect

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
on the new one you're going to connect

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.469 
on the new one you're going to connect
the<00:01:46.259> wiring<00:01:46.439> harness<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.100> first<00:01:47.310> put<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.390> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the wiring harness to it first put it in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
the wiring harness to it first put it in
the<00:01:48.540> hole<00:01:48.750> screw<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.149> bing-bang-boom

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the hole screw it in bing-bang-boom

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
the hole screw it in bing-bang-boom
I<00:01:51.659> use<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.500> anti-seize<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.939> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
I use a little bit of anti-seize on the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
I use a little bit of anti-seize on the
threads<00:01:54.509> tools<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> are<00:01:55.649> used<00:01:55.860> or<00:01:56.250> right
