00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.007
Have to get some bream. Haven't got
any smoked bream for a while now.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.400
Got my first bream.

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.233
But this is so small,
so it goes back.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:37.033
At least one big bream, so I can smoke
something. Got already perch at home.

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.782
Weird that even roach don't bite.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.484
I let it taste little longer.
Damn...

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:49.067
Was it a pike?

00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:58.791
Damn, I got a pike on.
Damn, how big it is!

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:02.004
On the wrong hook!

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.842
Got a pike on a little hook.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.952
It hung onto the bream.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.100
Pike hung onto the bream.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:36.764
Too bad I can't
throw this bream back.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.957
Cork is gone.

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.039
Fish is on.

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:06.012
Is it a bigger bream now?

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:09.995
What we got there?

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:12.994
Damn, what a big perch!

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.957
Damn, what a perch!

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.631
Biggest perch in my life.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.931
Damn, what a perch!

00:02:26.156 --> 00:02:32.987
Fuck! Now that's a monster.
Gonna weigh it.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.751
Only half a kilo,
but look how big it is.

00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:57.702
Epic.

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:07.105
Something is on.

00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:15.105
Little bream again.

00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:21.105
Back in.

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:27.105
Something bigger.

00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:31.105
Damn, little bream again.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.441
Same size all the time.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.441
Damn, same size again.
Totally identical breams.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.441

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.441
This bream I'll keep.

00:04:21.085 --> 00:04:23.763
This is going into the smoker.

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:29.774
Yea, about 0,5 kilo. Finally.

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.965
Took time to get one.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.798
Where the hell is that hook?

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.806
Got it.

00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:51.494
Maybe I'll get some more breams now.

00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:58.794
Got my bream for the smoker. Haven't
got any smoked bream for a while.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.794
Under the water.

00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.794
Smaller again.

00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.794
Breams are here.

00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.794
Not biting anymore.

00:05:22.063 --> 00:05:26.679
Biting again. It's on. Heavy.

00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:31.909
Heavy. Bream for the smoker.

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:39.064
This is going into the smoker.

00:05:40.443 --> 00:05:43.901
Same size. Also about 0,5 kg.

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:50.524
Wasn't stuck much, but I got
my breams for the smoker.

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.224
Biting again. It's going.

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:03.017

00:06:09.538 --> 00:06:11.703
Small one again.

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:25.902
Biting.

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:32.937
Let's see if it's a little one.

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:40.394

00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:55.867
Cork is flat. It's going.

00:06:57.092 --> 00:06:59.807
Same size again.

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:04.012
Don't have anything
to do with small ones.

00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:09.005
It's going and going and it's heavy.

00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:18.785
