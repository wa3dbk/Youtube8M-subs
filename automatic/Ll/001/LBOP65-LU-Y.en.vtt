the<00:02:06.360> trial<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.239> randomly<00:02:09.239> assign<00:02:09.800> half<00:02:10.800> of

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the trial was to randomly assign half of

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.110 
the trial was to randomly assign half of
the<00:02:11.160> subjects<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.330> treatment<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the subjects to one treatment and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.250 
the subjects to one treatment and
half<00:02:13.269> of<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> subjects<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.110> other

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
half of the subjects to the other

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.890 
half of the subjects to the other
treatment<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.370> double<00:02:15.700> blinded<00:02:16.120> study

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
treatment it's a double blinded study

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.960 
treatment it's a double blinded study
meaning<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.799> as<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.069> investigators<00:02:18.790> had

no<00:02:19.180> idea<00:02:19.540> who<00:02:20.049> we<00:02:20.260> were<00:02:20.409> assigning<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:20.980> what

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
no idea who we were assigning to what

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.490 
condition but we didn't know what those
were<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.569> subjects<00:02:25.959> are<00:02:26.049> assigned<00:02:26.080> to

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
were so the subjects are assigned to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.280

they<00:02:32.079> possibly<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:33.010> then<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.970> cross

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
they possibly can and then they cross

condition a to start with they would

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.530 
condition a to start with they would
then<00:02:38.170> transitioned<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.519> treatment<00:02:40.060> B<00:02:40.239> or

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
then transitioned it to treatment B or

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.809 
then transitioned it to treatment B or
condition<00:02:41.200> B<00:02:41.409> for<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> second<00:02:42.370> trial<00:02:42.610> and

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
condition B for the second trial and

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.420 
condition B for the second trial and
vice-versa<00:02:43.480> B<00:02:43.659> to<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.220> way

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
vice-versa B to a and so in that way

ASEA<00:04:10.209> we<00:04:11.199> didn't<00:04:11.530> think<00:04:11.889> that<00:04:12.190> drinking<00:04:12.519> ASEA

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199

would<00:04:14.199> shift<00:04:14.590> metabolites<00:04:15.579> chronically<00:04:16.510> we

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
would shift metabolites chronically we

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.539 
would shift metabolites chronically we
thought<00:04:17.500> it<00:04:17.650> would<00:04:17.739> do<00:04:17.889> something<00:04:18.310> during

from<00:04:43.750> ASEA<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.830> were<00:04:44.920> just<00:04:45.070> like<00:04:45.190> wow<00:04:45.400> there's

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
from ASEA we were just like wow there's

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.700 
from ASEA we were just like wow there's
something<00:04:46.180> really<00:04:46.600> interesting<00:04:46.750> going<00:04:47.350> on

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
something really interesting going on

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.260 
something really interesting going on
that<00:04:48.130> we<00:04:48.250> weren't<00:04:48.430> picking<00:04:48.670> up<00:04:48.880> from<00:04:49.060> our

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
that we weren't picking up from our

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.380 
that we weren't picking up from our
traditional<00:04:49.930> markers<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.920> in<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.910> last<00:04:52.150> data

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
traditional markers and in the last data

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.880 
traditional markers and in the last data
set<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.780> we<00:04:52.870> had<00:04:53.020> come<00:04:53.200> in<00:04:53.350> was<00:04:53.530> metabolomics

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
set that we had come in was metabolomics

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.090 
set that we had come in was metabolomics
and<00:04:54.490> there<00:04:54.580> were<00:04:54.670> these<00:04:54.760> huge<00:04:55.000> differences<00:04:55.600> in

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
and there were these huge differences in

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.460 
and there were these huge differences in
free<00:04:57.100> fatty<00:04:57.310> acid<00:04:57.760> mobilization<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.690> so<00:04:59.380> that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
free fatty acid mobilization and so that

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.630 
free fatty acid mobilization and so that
was<00:04:59.590> kind<00:04:59.740> of<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.860> shock<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.100> us<00:05:00.370> because<00:05:00.520> we

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
was kind of a shock to us because we

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.740 
was kind of a shock to us because we
weren't<00:05:00.790> expecting<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.210> see<00:05:01.300> anything<00:05:01.660> at

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
weren't expecting to see anything at

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.570 
weren't expecting to see anything at
that<00:05:01.780> point<00:05:01.900> but<00:05:02.410> there's<00:05:03.310> certainly

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
that point but there's certainly

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.800 
that point but there's certainly
something<00:05:03.880> going<00:05:04.060> on<00:05:04.150> there<00:05:04.360> which<00:05:04.510> is<00:05:04.630> really

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
something going on there which is really

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.280 
something going on there which is really
interesting

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
interesting

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.280 
interesting
we<00:05:06.100> have<00:05:06.430> rarely<00:05:06.880> seen<00:05:07.420> such<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.780> drastic

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
we have rarely seen such a drastic

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.610 
we have rarely seen such a drastic
difference<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:10.200> compounds<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.290> we<00:05:11.410> look

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
difference in the compounds that we look

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.890 
difference in the compounds that we look
at<00:05:11.830> we're<00:05:12.070> looking<00:05:12.400> at<00:05:12.550> probably<00:05:12.850> about<00:05:12.970> 150

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
at we're looking at probably about 150

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.220 
at we're looking at probably about 150
to<00:05:14.050> 200<00:05:14.560> compounds<00:05:15.450> 443<00:05:16.450> of<00:05:16.600> those<00:05:16.750> signals<00:05:16.960> to

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
to 200 compounds 443 of those signals to

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.330 
to 200 compounds 443 of those signals to
change<00:05:17.500> that's<00:05:17.680> a<00:05:17.770> quarter<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.250> the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
change that's a quarter of the

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.980 
change that's a quarter of the
metabolite<00:05:18.820> profile<00:05:19.210> that<00:05:19.360> we're<00:05:19.510> monitoring

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
metabolite profile that we're monitoring

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.610 
metabolite profile that we're monitoring
so<00:05:20.110> it's<00:05:20.230> a<00:05:20.350> huge<00:05:20.650> bump<00:05:21.310> in<00:05:21.510> metabolite<00:05:22.510> shifts

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
so it's a huge bump in metabolite shifts

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.250 
so it's a huge bump in metabolite shifts
due<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.830> just<00:05:24.040> ingestion<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.820> one<00:05:25.420> product<00:05:25.870> so

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
due to just ingestion of one product so

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.560 
due to just ingestion of one product so
it's<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.620> drastic<00:05:27.070> difference<00:05:27.190> I<00:05:27.730> didn't

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
it's a drastic difference I didn't

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.480 
it's a drastic difference I didn't
believe<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.870> so<00:05:29.440> when<00:05:29.590> I<00:05:29.620> saw<00:05:29.890> this<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:30.370> know

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
believe it so when I saw this you know

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.290 
believe it so when I saw this you know
that<00:05:30.870> 443<00:05:31.870> metabolites<00:05:32.470> were<00:05:35.220> differentially

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
that 443 metabolites were differentially

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.730 
that 443 metabolites were differentially

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
there were at different levels III

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.280 
there were at different levels III
didn't<00:05:39.610> believe<00:05:39.790> it<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.510> I've<00:05:40.660> done<00:05:40.840> studies

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
didn't believe it and I've done studies

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.930 
didn't believe it and I've done studies
with<00:05:41.440> with<00:05:41.800> microarray<00:05:42.310> analysis<00:05:42.790> where

never<00:05:58.870> seen<00:05:59.169> before<00:05:59.370> something<00:06:00.370> that<00:06:00.520> caused

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
never seen before something that caused

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.870 
never seen before something that caused
these<00:06:01.090> scientists<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:02.110> use<00:06:02.260> words<00:06:02.560> like

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
these scientists to use words like

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.450 
these scientists to use words like
astounding<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.260> massive<00:06:05.260> but<00:06:06.070> what<00:06:06.310> exactly

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
astounding and massive but what exactly

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.540 
astounding and massive but what exactly
did<00:06:06.940> these<00:06:07.060> metabolite<00:06:07.720> shifts<00:06:07.750> mean<00:06:08.320> many<00:06:09.130> of

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
did these metabolite shifts mean many of

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.870 
did these metabolite shifts mean many of
the<00:06:09.700> metabolites<00:06:10.330> were<00:06:10.570> related<00:06:11.290> to<00:06:11.880> plasma

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
the metabolites were related to plasma

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.490 
the metabolites were related to plasma
free<00:06:13.150> fatty<00:06:13.419> acids<00:06:13.990> so<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.320> athletes

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
free fatty acids so the athletes

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.520 
free fatty acids so the athletes
actually<00:06:15.130> started<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.150> exercise<00:06:16.530> after

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
actually started the exercise after

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.020 
actually started the exercise after
drinking<00:06:18.070> ASEA<00:06:18.300> with<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.540> lot<00:06:19.900> more<00:06:20.380> of<00:06:20.740> these

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
drinking ASEA with a lot more of these

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.510 
drinking ASEA with a lot more of these
free<00:06:22.030> fatty<00:06:22.300> acids<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:23.080> their<00:06:23.560> blood<00:06:23.950> the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
free fatty acids in their blood the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.850 
free fatty acids in their blood the
reason<00:06:24.910> that's<00:06:25.060> important<00:06:25.810> is<00:06:26.050> then<00:06:26.710> the

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
reason that's important is then the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.020 
reason that's important is then the
muscles<00:06:27.430> will<00:06:27.580> actually<00:06:28.150> use<00:06:28.510> that<00:06:28.540> as<00:06:29.020> fuel

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
muscles will actually use that as fuel

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.270 
muscles will actually use that as fuel
sparing<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.210> muscle<00:06:31.570> glycogen<00:06:31.690> and<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:33.070> use

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
sparing the muscle glycogen and the use

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.000 
sparing the muscle glycogen and the use
of<00:06:33.490> amino<00:06:33.789> acids<00:06:34.390> which<00:06:34.600> is<00:06:34.750> what<00:06:34.900> we<00:06:35.020> found<00:06:35.289> as

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
of amino acids which is what we found as

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.400 
of amino acids which is what we found as
we<00:06:36.280> analyzed<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.820> data<00:06:36.850> and<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:37.990> three<00:06:38.200> fatty

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.410 
we analyzed the data and the three fatty

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.050 
we analyzed the data and the three fatty
acids<00:06:38.800> are

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
acids are

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.180 
acids are
very<00:06:39.600> important<00:06:40.080> because<00:06:40.200> during<00:06:40.590> exercise

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
very important because during exercise

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.450 
very important because during exercise
will<00:06:41.910> oxidize<00:06:42.240> those<00:06:42.930> to<00:06:43.440> make<00:06:43.650> energy<00:06:44.130> in<00:06:44.280> the

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
will oxidize those to make energy in the

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.820 
will oxidize those to make energy in the
form<00:06:44.580> of<00:06:44.760> ATP<00:06:44.940> so<00:06:45.840> what<00:06:46.230> we<00:06:46.320> found<00:06:46.530> in<00:06:46.710> the

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
form of ATP so what we found in the

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.980 
form of ATP so what we found in the
study<00:06:47.070> was<00:06:47.550> that<00:06:47.610> there<00:06:48.180> was<00:06:48.300> increased<00:06:48.720> fatty

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
study was that there was increased fatty

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.690 
study was that there was increased fatty
acids<00:06:49.500> that<00:06:49.590> were<00:06:49.710> available<00:06:49.950> and<00:06:50.370> fatty

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
acids that were available and fatty

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.360 
acids that were available and fatty
acids<00:06:51.180> are<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.420> fuel<00:06:51.750> source<00:06:52.080> for<00:06:52.350> exercise<00:06:53.040> so

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
acids are a fuel source for exercise so

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.180 
acids are a fuel source for exercise so
if<00:06:54.300> there<00:06:54.540> are<00:06:54.690> available<00:06:55.350> then<00:06:55.650> what<00:06:55.980> could

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
if there are available then what could

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.800 
if there are available then what could
be<00:06:56.310> happening<00:06:56.490> is<00:06:56.970> we<00:06:57.150> might<00:06:57.330> be<00:06:57.450> able<00:06:57.570> to<00:06:57.630> go<00:06:57.780> a

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
be happening is we might be able to go a

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.620 
be happening is we might be able to go a
little<00:06:57.960> bit<00:06:58.170> longer<00:06:58.320> with<00:06:59.190> ASEA<00:06:59.520> we<00:07:00.210> might<00:07:00.450> be

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
little bit longer with ASEA we might be

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.690 
little bit longer with ASEA we might be
able<00:07:00.750> to<00:07:00.870> recover<00:07:01.050> quicker<00:07:01.560> between<00:07:02.010> bouts<00:07:02.190> so

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
able to recover quicker between bouts so

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.190 
able to recover quicker between bouts so
there's<00:07:03.000> a<00:07:03.090> lot<00:07:03.300> of<00:07:03.450> things<00:07:03.630> that<00:07:03.780> are<00:07:03.870> coming

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
there's a lot of things that are coming

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.020 
there's a lot of things that are coming
out<00:07:04.260> that<00:07:04.290> are<00:07:04.470> quite<00:07:04.680> exciting<00:07:05.130> my<00:07:05.820> thoughts

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
out that are quite exciting my thoughts

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.810 
out that are quite exciting my thoughts
on<00:07:06.270> the<00:07:06.390> the<00:07:06.690> study<00:07:06.930> is<00:07:07.110> well<00:07:07.860> my<00:07:08.400> first<00:07:08.610> off

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
on the the study is well my first off

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.490 
on the the study is well my first off
one<00:07:09.060> was<00:07:09.240> sort<00:07:09.570> of<00:07:09.660> like<00:07:09.780> I<00:07:09.840> already<00:07:10.140> kind<00:07:10.380> of

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
one was sort of like I already kind of

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.370 
one was sort of like I already kind of
knew<00:07:10.680> this<00:07:11.000> just<00:07:12.000> through<00:07:12.180> my<00:07:12.210> own<00:07:12.450> experience

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 
knew this just through my own experience

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.290 
knew this just through my own experience
with<00:07:13.500> the<00:07:13.620> product<00:07:14.010> so<00:07:14.070> but<00:07:14.730> at<00:07:14.850> the<00:07:14.970> same<00:07:15.150> time

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
with the product so but at the same time

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.570 
with the product so but at the same time
it's<00:07:15.480> great<00:07:15.750> to<00:07:15.930> have<00:07:16.080> that<00:07:16.380> that<00:07:16.680> solid

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
it's great to have that that solid

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.460 
it's great to have that that solid
evidence<00:07:18.030> that<00:07:18.150> laboratory<00:07:18.810> test<00:07:19.110> that<00:07:19.230> makes

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
evidence that laboratory test that makes

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.800 
evidence that laboratory test that makes
it<00:07:19.650> official<00:07:19.800> gets<00:07:20.760> the<00:07:20.940> official<00:07:21.270> stamp<00:07:21.630> of

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
it official gets the official stamp of

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.530 
it official gets the official stamp of
approval<00:07:21.930> from<00:07:22.380> the<00:07:22.560> scientists<00:07:23.130> and<00:07:23.250> then<00:07:23.970> to

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
approval from the scientists and then to

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.220 
approval from the scientists and then to
go<00:07:24.660> along<00:07:24.900> with<00:07:25.080> the<00:07:25.260> stamp<00:07:25.620> of<00:07:25.740> approval<00:07:25.860> from
