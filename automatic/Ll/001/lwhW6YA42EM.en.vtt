is<00:00:00.089> a<00:00:00.149> arrow<00:00:00.870> on<00:00:01.319> there<00:00:01.589> showing<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.250> which<00:00:02.550> is

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
is a arrow on there showing you which is

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.599 
is a arrow on there showing you which is
the<00:00:03.179> top<00:00:03.990> part<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.589> which<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.220> bottom

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
the top part and which is the bottom

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.249 
the top part and which is the bottom
part<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.690> don't<00:00:06.930> put<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.200> in

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
part so that you don't put it in

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.709 
part so that you don't put it in
backwards<00:00:07.560> so<00:00:08.460> look<00:00:08.639> real<00:00:08.880> close<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.450> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
backwards so look real close for the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:19.420 
backwards so look real close for the
part<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.860> says<00:00:11.010> tub<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:12.719> either<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:18.260> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
part that says tub and are either up and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.330 
part that says tub and are either up and
right<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:20.730> we're<00:00:21.000> measuring<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.080> height<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
right here we're measuring the height of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.939 
right here we're measuring the height of
the<00:00:23.519> showerhead<00:00:23.880> itself<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:25.560> standard

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the showerhead itself the standard

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.300 
the showerhead itself the standard
height<00:00:26.130> should<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.609> 6<00:00:27.330> foot<00:00:27.510> 6<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:29.130> this

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
height should be 6 foot 6 and in this

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.179 
height should be 6 foot 6 and in this
case<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.480> shorter<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.980> have

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
case this one is shorter so we will have

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
case this one is shorter so we will have
to<00:00:32.430> bring<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> showerhead<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.410> bring<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to bring the showerhead up to bring it

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:53.670 
to bring the showerhead up to bring it
up<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.010> today's<00:00:35.460> standard

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:03.439 

and<00:00:54.510> 656<00:00:58.560> it's<00:00:59.560> just<00:00:59.860> about<00:01:00.100> right<00:01:00.370> here<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and 656 it's just about right here so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.360 
and 656 it's just about right here so
when<00:01:04.449> we<00:01:04.629> do<00:01:04.900> reassemble<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.729> new<00:01:08.370> shower

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
when we do reassemble the new shower

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.490 
when we do reassemble the new shower
valve<00:01:09.640> we<00:01:10.000> will<00:01:12.360> allow<00:01:13.360> for<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.610> extra<00:01:16.500> riser

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
valve we will allow for the extra riser

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.280 
valve we will allow for the extra riser
for<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.930> showerhead<00:01:19.930> itself<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.840> few<00:01:23.140> four

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
for the showerhead itself as a few four

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
for the showerhead itself as a few four
inches

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.920 

now<00:01:43.450> before<00:01:44.110> we<00:01:44.590> get<00:01:45.549> started<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.150> usually<00:01:46.720> like

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
now before we get started I usually like

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.510 
now before we get started I usually like
to<00:01:46.960> just<00:01:47.470> kind<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.740> lay<00:01:47.890> some<00:01:48.189> of<00:01:48.280> my<00:01:48.369> material

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
to just kind of lay some of my material

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.260 
to just kind of lay some of my material
out<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:50.650> get<00:01:50.799> some<00:01:50.950> pre<00:01:51.310> pieces<00:01:51.820> that<00:01:52.119> up

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
out and just get some pre pieces that up

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.060 
out and just get some pre pieces that up
you<00:01:52.659> know<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:52.990> random<00:01:53.259> pieces<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.950> are

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
you know just random pieces that are

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.620 
you know just random pieces that are
already<00:01:54.190> there<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.909> could<00:01:55.090> use<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:58.140> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
already there that I could use and the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
already there that I could use and the
valve<00:02:01.630> itself<00:02:02.049> clean<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> fittings<00:02:03.220> flex<00:02:03.670> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.469 

solder<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.110> no<00:02:08.560> corrode<00:02:09.330> flux<00:02:10.330> that

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
solder this is the no corrode flux that

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:23.510 
solder this is the no corrode flux that
I<00:02:10.569> like<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.840> use<00:02:11.730> number<00:02:12.730> five

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.460 

and<00:02:24.060> usually<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:26.070> be<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.580> best<00:02:27.470> solder

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
and usually the to be the best solder

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.600 
and usually the to be the best solder
jobs<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.360> when<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.570> clean<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.080> excess<00:02:31.610> flux

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
jobs are when you clean the excess flux

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.870 
jobs are when you clean the excess flux
off<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.330> outside<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.580> fittings<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
off the outside of the fittings at the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.060 
off the outside of the fittings at the
pipe<00:02:38.600> because<00:02:39.600> we<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.930> flux<00:02:40.290> everywhere<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
pipe because we have flux everywhere the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.000 
pipe because we have flux everywhere the
flux<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.910> solder<00:02:42.600> will<00:02:42.960> follow<00:02:43.320> all<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.710> flux

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
flux the solder will follow all the flux

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.880 
flux the solder will follow all the flux
and<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.310> make<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.490> mess<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.470> just<00:02:46.470> clean<00:02:46.710> them

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and just make a mess so just clean them

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.830 
and just make a mess so just clean them
and<00:02:47.250> wipe<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.730> down<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.150> you'll<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> nice

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
and wipe it down and you'll have a nice

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.320 
and wipe it down and you'll have a nice
neat<00:02:49.350> solder<00:02:49.860> joint<00:02:54.020> we<00:02:55.020> have<00:02:55.200> our<00:02:55.970> free<00:02:56.970> cloth

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
neat solder joint we have our free cloth

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:29.930 
neat solder joint we have our free cloth
what<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:58.080> use<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.710> fiberglass

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.750 

you<00:03:30.940> see<00:03:31.120> how<00:03:31.210> easy<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.630> just<00:03:32.730> slid<00:03:33.730> right

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
you see how easy that just slid right

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.910 
you see how easy that just slid right
out<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.120> there<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.570> usually<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.710> use<00:03:35.740> a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
out of there I usually like to use a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.430 
out of there I usually like to use a
little<00:03:36.130> trick<00:03:36.460> with<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> genoise<00:03:37.690> pliers<00:03:38.200> at

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
little trick with the genoise pliers at

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.090 
little trick with the genoise pliers at
x8p<00:03:41.820> copper<00:03:42.820> tubing<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.710> way<00:03:44.890> when<00:03:45.070> I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
x8p copper tubing so this way when I

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.070 
x8p copper tubing so this way when I
push<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.520> up<00:03:45.610> into<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.910> hole<00:03:46.090> by<00:03:46.600> being<00:03:46.840> egg

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
push it up into the hole by being egg

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.680 
push it up into the hole by being egg
shape<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:48.640> will<00:03:48.790> sit<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.840> sit<00:03:50.200> nice<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.690> firm

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
shape it will sit and sit nice and firm

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.830 
shape it will sit and sit nice and firm
and<00:03:53.470> it<00:03:53.830> won't<00:03:53.980> pull<00:03:54.190> out<00:03:54.220> as<00:03:54.550> easy<00:03:54.820> so<00:03:55.210> when

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and it won't pull out as easy so when

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.770 
and it won't pull out as easy so when
you're<00:03:56.020> working<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.650> vertical<00:03:57.570> solder<00:03:58.570> you

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
you're working on a vertical solder you

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.350 
you're working on a vertical solder you
don't<00:03:58.960> worry<00:03:59.230> have<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.740> worry<00:03:59.920> about<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.370> pipe

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
don't worry have to worry about the pipe

00:04:01.360 --> 00:05:59.420 
don't worry have to worry about the pipe
falling<00:04:01.690> out<00:04:01.810> see
