00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.630
 i 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.600
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
 live guitar dotcom today I'm going to 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.310
 teach to play the new single of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 Amaral is about when the tide rises 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.700
 As always, I'm going to teach you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.710
 parts I will teach all the chords and 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.840
 to the rhythm so you can play it without 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.840
 no kind of problem let's see it 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.390
 Well, the first thing we have to do 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.950
 keep in mind is that if we want that 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.800
 sound the theme as it sounds in the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.380
 disk we're going to need a grid and 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.890
 let's put it on the fret 1 this what 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.390
 do you mean 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.520
 If you do not have a nut, you can also 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.860
 Touch the subject but it will not sound 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.930
 just as on the disc it is worth the chords 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.190
 they would be exactly the same but so that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.710
 you tend the tonality of the disc 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.390
 you need a nut and you need 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.309
 put it on the fret 1 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.400
 If you do not have a nut, you can enter 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.610
 here and you see a tutorial that I have about 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.980
 how to make a capo with a pencil 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.680
 you also have it on my web www guitar 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.770
 viva puntocom now let's see how it is 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.050
 the topic well first let's start with 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 the intro the first agreement that we 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.670
 we find is a sun 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.369
 then we went to network 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.670
 then another sun 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 ninth 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 and sun again 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 that does it twice we will see how 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.670
 would be 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.410
 i 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.510
 after that we have the stanza the 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.020
 stanza would be the same starts just like 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.060
 what is the intro sun 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.590
 king 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.270
 Sun 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.520
 ninth sun 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.490
 after sun 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.020
 ninth 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.820
 jesÃºs network normal and current and re their 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.820
 four goes back to put network 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.599
 it would be like this 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.409
 ah 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.980
 and now the second part of the stanza 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.940
 they would be two 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.820
 net 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.580
 sun and now the typical movement 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.510
 harmonic sun has sustained my minor 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.390
 king 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.870
 net 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.980
 Sun 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.980
 they are not 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.100
 let's see what these two parts would look like 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.100
 together 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.610
 good and now we have the refrain the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.610
 chorus would be like that 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.520
 Sun 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.450
 ninth 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.450
 the ninth 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.260
 ninth 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.260
 single 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.260
 22 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.260
 and the other part of the chorus would be 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.350
 this me 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.990
 king 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.610
 Sun 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.270
 I am not 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.270
 king 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.240
 and now he makes another 2 but he does not follow 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.240
 pawning 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.590
 Sun 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.800
 and after this what he does is repeat 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.900
 again and again the subject what happens in the 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.850
 fake star is only once in the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.990
 repetition 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.410
 let's see how the whole topic would be 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.410
 ah 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.250
 all right 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.090
 good and you already have the whole subject as 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.070
 I always remember you in www guitar
