00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
loaded in my dehydrator you don't need

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.070 
loaded in my dehydrator you don't need
to<00:01:28.220> see<00:01:28.430> me<00:01:28.580> put<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.030> in<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.420> my<00:01:29.540> tray<00:01:29.810> my

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
to see me put it in on my tray my

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.530 
to see me put it in on my tray my
dehydrator<00:01:30.490> but<00:01:31.490> isn't<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.030> neatest

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
dehydrator but isn't this the neatest

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.410 
dehydrator but isn't this the neatest
thing<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.920> have<00:01:34.130> one<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.370> these<00:01:34.550> blenders

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
thing if you have one of these blenders

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.240 
thing if you have one of these blenders
but<00:01:35.660> you<00:01:35.810> don't<00:01:36.020> have<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.320> attachment

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
but you don't have the attachment

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.880 
but you don't have the attachment
it<00:01:37.370> is<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.090> worth<00:01:38.360> having<00:01:38.870> these<00:01:38.990> attachments

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
it is so worth having these attachments

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.940 
it is so worth having these attachments
for<00:01:40.130> your<00:01:40.160> blender<00:01:41.200> like<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.380> said<00:01:42.650> when<00:01:42.830> you're

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
for your blender like I said when you're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.860 
for your blender like I said when you're
doing<00:01:43.310> Pulp<00:01:43.640> cheese<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:47.210> much<00:01:47.390> easier<00:01:47.840> to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
doing Pulp cheese so much easier to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.740 
doing Pulp cheese so much easier to
write<00:01:48.230> large<00:01:48.860> amounts<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.430> cheese<00:01:49.760> personal

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
write large amounts of cheese personal

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.990 
write large amounts of cheese personal
can<00:01:50.990> grading<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.680> taking<00:01:52.040> in<00:01:52.190> nails

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
can grading and taking in nails

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.300 
can grading and taking in nails
so<00:01:53.720> what<00:01:53.990> I'm<00:01:54.170> doing<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.770> I'm<00:01:54.950> going<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.190> go

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
so what I'm doing is I'm going to go

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.190 
so what I'm doing is I'm going to go
