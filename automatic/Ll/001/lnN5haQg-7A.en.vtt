00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.940
 Tomorrow I'm proud that's a few 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.420
 people did after 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 obviously difficult day yesterday 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 but have found the way here 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 It can be a very difficult game of congratulation 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.969
 keep stressing there is there in 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.280
 this league is not an easy task 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.430
 and when it goes in the area of use 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.110
 against team the difficult one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.629
 situation and in these three 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 Play nine points has phased as well 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.940
 the combative is played very well 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 element is also the element 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 to defend the lead 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 then you can have it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.359
 assume that this is a difficult 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.030
 task becomes clear to us we want 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.250
 hold our forward further 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.479
 we will try as in the past 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.729
 single away games in sandhausen 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 again take three points with you 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.409
 but can emphasize it again because of me 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 also the feeling that the one or 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.009
 Another year somehow has the feeling 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 also in the environment 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.540
 that is a very smooth running I can 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.909
 Just say that the games are hard too 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.189
 Winning are in this league that is 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.960
 Fact That does not just apply to us 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.479
 for others 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.390
 louder had problems at the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.770
 team has problems and if so 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.119
 somehow you do not have so much here in Cologne 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 dissatisfied but they say we have 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.600
 no team of the quality class of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 bavaria munich where even 3.4 points 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.840
 Plus my team are the ones on it 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.719
 we can also get a lot 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.950
 a team that will rise but 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.570
 we have to get everything if not 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.500
 get everything then we have three 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.819
 play four points 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.950
 makes good opponents 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.390
 and the competition will make you think of it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.620
 have not come closer though we are in 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.950
 Three games only need four points 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.189
 to have 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.370
 that means it for ours 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.840
 Colleagues are therefore not quite 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.290
 easy is your home games too 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.959
 bring 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.579
 that is fact and that is my access 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.069
 and I hope that a few questions 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.069
 come thank you 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.560
 I hope so too thanks Peter as always 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.879
 with a microphone you know that and like 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.769
 again in a row but that 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.700
 is of course with them who wants 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.629
 because get started 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.780
 yes Mr. oeynhausen achim schmidt everything 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.819
 clear 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.379
 Of course, lost points like her 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.500
 also as I said it is maybe 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.239
 This wake up call is good because many in the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.969
 environment we say all fc is going up anyway 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.760
 on and maybe some players off 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:06.540
 could possibly think of ignoring 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.620
 to bring back the ground of the facts 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.269
 so we can do it we can 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.650
 rate in the team is in must 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.840
 I really say trainers team anyway 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.009
 also the team as we know yes 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.989
 how we have worked our games 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:23.409
 the situation that we maybe now 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.259
 have it a little new because we are six 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.180
 For weeks maybe with the same 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.889
 the dÃ¼sseldorf game in the back of the head where 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.799
 then everyone is crazy before Christmas 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.359
 those have been the medial 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.709
 but, logically, also 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.150
 probably something in the environment of the players 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.019
 and so and to work together 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.879
 from then goes in the situation purely 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.430
 slips season is the question when 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.349
 we are through and it is special 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.599
 in a situation where we lead 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.819
 have to defend because expand 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.259
 and we were in the whole autumn 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.909
 a situation where we always someday 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.829
 there was a bit of a back 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.900
 a bit ahead and it was not like that 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.909
 lifted all the way around like that 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.319
 currently is and that's why I claim 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.239
 that it is a new situation with the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.039
 we also have to live on it ourselves 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.329
 but that must be done 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.930
 this troupe did not wake up from a week ago 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.939
 the other 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.349
 maybe I stay that way 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.759
 even if we are not quite so 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:18.159
 running around in the area but we are 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:19.590
 in a situation where i feel 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:23.110
 have 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.900
 that one has to live the cops we have 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.199
 which looks exactly 23 times in the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.030
 season so nothing new 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.100
 and that's what we'll be up to and 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.000
 will again be pointwise then if 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.690
 the trail is coming 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.940
 but these discussions and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.400
 These are the things that we do 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.340
 of course, because even this club this 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.740
 demanding the ambitious place and 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.500
 expectation in the environment has that is 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.960
 okay but you are our job that mean 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.910
 we have the right conclusions for us 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.750
 From that we take our rest 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.620
 save 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.860
 we know what we have on it when 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.380
 everything is OK and what we have to do 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.720
 so that it runs like this again from the game over 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.590
 90 minutes and from what we also 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.580
 expect 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.580
 that is very funny
