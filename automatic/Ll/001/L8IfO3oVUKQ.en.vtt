00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello guys and girls good we 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.100
 we found here working and showing 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.070
 a little bit about what the job consists of 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.390
 of the bonsai or question in this case in 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 strainer already with a substrate that we 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.079
 Allows good aeration for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.780
 roots a distinctly volcanic substrate 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.120
 mixed 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.100
 with some gravel 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.140
 so that it is not so dry so 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.910
 Maintain a certain percentage of humidity 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.710
 good is a variety is a crater 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.670
 is a creative that has around 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.270
 two to two and a half years is a plant 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.330
 new which when working in the colander 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.450
 we hurry its development as if it were 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.160
 directly on land 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.380
 because we grow in the colander the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.650
 colander allows us to have a better 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.780
 aeration in the roots 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.450
 it also allows us a development 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.810
 different to the roots the mold that 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.360
 forms the bread that is formed with the roots 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 they intertwine with each other then yes I do 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.690
 has to look for its development in the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.640
 concave shape or in the shape of the colander 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.130
 if at any time the roots come out 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.760
 feels in the air and does not develop 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.550
 more is the fat that has the strainer in 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.190
 this case the other guys and 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.430
 girls it is important that if you 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.290
 cultivate in this type of colander the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.710
 hydration that the plant will need 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 it becomes more necessary no longer serves watering 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.410
 only for example once a day in 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 the case here in chile we are already with 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.840
 with high temperatures over 30 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.430
 degrees then by being in a sector 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.980
 half shade, the substrate is 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.240
 it dehydrates as it dries up so there's 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.460
 to water at least one two three 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.820
 times a day it becomes very necessary 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.869
 theme of irrigation in this 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.540
 in this development in colander and the other 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:16.769
 to speed up development 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.230
 It is inevitable to pay the subscription in 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.670
 certain amount for this plant in a 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:28.310
 pot in bag or different other 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.310
 different or different 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.570
 pot is of a certain amount but 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.050
 be in collaboration we can pay in 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.310
 excess and everything that goes serving us 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.320
 he is automatically voting for him 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 the porosity they have for the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.060
 perforations that the colander has 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.300
 that's paying as fast as possible 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.540
 will damage the plant already in this case 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.540
 this pleasant and is already totally 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.200
 adapted to the climate adapted to water and 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.920
 adapted to the control of the fertilizer hopefully 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.770
 Serves 100% recommended but needs a 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.400
 little more attention that is the key the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.960
 hydration 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.020
 all these little plants work with 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.350
 hydration if you do not have the water 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.350
 unfortunately, it has not worked
