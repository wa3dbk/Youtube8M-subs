00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
part kit just right here's the half it

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
part kit just right here's the half it
goes<00:00:15.389> up<00:00:15.599> underneath<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.470> driver's<00:00:16.859> side<00:00:17.039> -

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310

it plugs into a 10 pin connector has a
couple<00:00:20.490> fuse<00:00:20.820> holders<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.750> have

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
couple fuse holders in it that have

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
couple fuse holders in it that have
little<00:00:22.080> 5<00:00:22.320> amp<00:00:22.529> fuses<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.400> will<00:00:23.640> be

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
little 5 amp fuses in it I will be

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
little 5 amp fuses in it I will be
installing<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.420> first<00:00:24.779> now<00:00:25.710> normally<00:00:26.099> there

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
installing this first now normally there

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.950 
installing this first now normally there
would<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.519> panel<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.810> you

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
would be a panel right here that you

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.630 
would be a panel right here that you
would<00:00:28.109> remove<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.189> car<00:00:29.460> it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
would remove but on this car it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
would remove but on this car it's
already<00:00:30.000> removed<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.689> some<00:00:30.869> reason<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
already removed for some reason so it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.069 
already removed for some reason so it
will<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:31.980> have<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> take<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.759> off<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
will not have to take that off now the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
will not have to take that off now the
other<00:00:34.260> half<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> plug<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.550> we're

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
other half of the plug that we're

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.380 
other half of the plug that we're
looking<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> actually<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:38.390> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
looking for is actually up in here it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.209 
looking for is actually up in here it
actually<00:00:39.600> has<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> blue<00:00:40.649> tape

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
actually has a little bit of blue tape

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.340 
actually has a little bit of blue tape
holding<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.879> place<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.260> we're

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
holding it in place so that's what we're

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.510 
holding it in place so that's what we're
going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.620> plugging<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.070> connector

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
going to be plugging the connector

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
going to be plugging the connector
that's<00:00:44.730> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.300> box<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> two<00:00:46.200> fuses

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that's on the box with the two fuses

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.660 
that's on the box with the two fuses
connected<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
connected to it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.819 
connected to it
so<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.390> ahead<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.780> reach<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> there<00:00:49.559> well

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so go ahead and reach up in there well

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
so go ahead and reach up in there well
plug<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.149> we'll<00:00:51.239> need<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.629> adhere

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
plug it in and then we'll need to adhere

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
plug it in and then we'll need to adhere
our<00:00:52.379> box<00:00:52.800> using<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.309> two<00:00:53.550> sided<00:00:53.820> tape<00:00:54.120> that's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
our box using the two sided tape that's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.130 
our box using the two sided tape that's
already<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
already on it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.930 
already on it
somewhere<00:00:55.559> underneath<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.340> may<00:00:56.520> even<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
somewhere underneath we may even use a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.000 
somewhere underneath we may even use a
zip<00:00:57.239> tie<00:00:57.449> depending<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.170> how<00:00:58.320> much<00:00:58.440> extra<00:00:58.829> wire

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
zip tie depending on how much extra wire

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.900 
zip tie depending on how much extra wire
we<00:00:59.219> have<00:01:00.590> we<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:01.890> two<00:01:02.070> halves<00:01:02.340> lined<00:01:02.670> up

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
we have we got our two halves lined up

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
we have we got our two halves lined up
and<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.690> them<00:01:03.809> lined<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.170> we'll<00:01:04.320> go

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and so we get them lined up we'll go

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.630 
and so we get them lined up we'll go
ahead<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> push<00:01:04.830> them<00:01:04.979> together<00:01:05.070> making<00:01:05.460> sure

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
ahead and push them together making sure

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.969 
ahead and push them together making sure
we<00:01:05.939> hear<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> locking<00:01:06.630> tab<00:01:06.930> click<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.159> place

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
we hear the locking tab click into place

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.020 
we hear the locking tab click into place
you'll<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> double<00:01:11.760> check<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you'll also want to double check and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
you'll also want to double check and
make<00:01:12.240> sure<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:12.960> each<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> fuse

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
make sure that in each of the fuse

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280 
make sure that in each of the fuse
holders<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> fuse<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> 5<00:01:16.049> amp

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
holders there is a fuse it is a 5 amp

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.999 
holders there is a fuse it is a 5 amp
fuse<00:01:17.930> right<00:01:18.930> down<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> good<00:01:19.799> spot

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
fuse right down and there's a good spot
to<00:01:20.240> secure<00:01:21.240> our<00:01:21.360> box

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to secure our box

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
to secure our box
now<00:01:22.439> before<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:22.830> adhere<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.280> box<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.970> the
