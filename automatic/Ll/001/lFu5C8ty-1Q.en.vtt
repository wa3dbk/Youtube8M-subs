the test one of these units turn the
ignition<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:24.110> which<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:24.950> should<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.280> green

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550

light

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.760 
light
secondly<00:02:26.600> we<00:02:26.810> start<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.230> vehicle<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.590> in

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
secondly we start the vehicle and in

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.500 
secondly we start the vehicle and in
case<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.130> flashing<00:02:31.640> which<00:02:31.760> means<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.180> unit's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
case the flashing which means the unit's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.580 
case the flashing which means the unit's
reading<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.380> then<00:02:33.770> if<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.010> give<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.340> rev

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
reading and then if you give it a rev

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.840 
reading and then if you give it a rev
the<00:02:36.590> red<00:02:36.770> light<00:02:36.950> will<00:02:37.100> come<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.490> it's

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
the red light will come on when it's

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.700 
the red light will come on when it's
revving<00:02:38.210> that's<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:38.990> need<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.290> do<00:02:39.440> and

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
revving that's all you need to do and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.440 
revving that's all you need to do and
then<00:02:39.950> you're<00:02:40.130> right<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.550> go<00:02:40.640> for<00:02:40.850> road<00:02:41.030> tests

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
then you're right to go for road tests

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.680 
then you're right to go for road tests
which<00:02:41.690> we'll<00:02:41.870> do<00:02:42.020> right<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:43.390> we've<00:02:44.390> got<00:02:44.570> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
which we'll do right now we've got it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.720 
which we'll do right now we've got it
set<00:02:44.900> on<00:02:44.930> number<00:02:45.620> five<00:02:45.830> at<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.100> moment<00:02:46.490> this

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
set on number five at the moment this

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.910 
set on number five at the moment this
particular<00:02:47.060> chip<00:02:47.480> has<00:02:47.630> nine<00:02:47.870> settings<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
particular chip has nine settings the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.650 
particular chip has nine settings the
power<00:02:49.160> comes<00:02:49.580> on<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.790> lot<00:02:50.060> quicker<00:02:50.390> than<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
power comes on a lot quicker than it

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.110 
power comes on a lot quicker than it
used<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.960> so<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.440> hits<00:02:51.620> boost<00:02:51.980> earlier<00:02:52.610> you

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
used to so it hits boost earlier you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.540 
used to so it hits boost earlier you
seem<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.570> more<00:02:53.810> power<00:02:54.110> on<00:02:54.410> reserve<00:02:54.890> what

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
seem to have more power on reserve what

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.080 
seem to have more power on reserve what
we<00:02:55.790> want<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.420> freeway<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:58.100> customers<00:02:58.610> noted
