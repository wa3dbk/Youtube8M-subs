it's meant to replace the free 5.0 model
there's<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> few<00:00:16.070> significant<00:00:17.070> while<00:00:17.340> subtle

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
there's a few significant while subtle

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.960 
there's a few significant while subtle
significant<00:00:18.900> changes<00:00:19.350> i<00:00:19.529> would<00:00:19.980> say<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.820> this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
significant changes i would say to this

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.170 
significant changes i would say to this
design<00:00:21.890> obviously<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
design obviously you have the the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
design obviously you have the the
different<00:00:24.630> patterns<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.760> more

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
different patterns and and this is more

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.030 
different patterns and and this is more
like<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.210> cage<00:00:27.900> like<00:00:27.930> mesh<00:00:28.650> design<00:00:29.300> and<00:00:31.040> you

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
like a cage like mesh design and you

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.979 
like a cage like mesh design and you
know<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:34.640> laces<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.820> offset<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.750> i

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
know the the laces are offset more i

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
know the the laces are offset more i
think<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.710> were<00:00:37.770> having<00:00:38.100> problems<00:00:38.129> with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
think they were having problems with

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.350 
think they were having problems with
with<00:00:39.090> people<00:00:39.410> complaining<00:00:40.410> about<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
with people complaining about this the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440 
with people complaining about this the
the<00:00:42.780> lace<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.230> digging<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.100> where<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:45.210> see

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the lace is digging in where you see

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510 
the lace is digging in where you see
they<00:00:45.600> attach<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.289> digging<00:00:46.829> into<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> top<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
they attach here digging into the top of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.310 
they attach here digging into the top of
people's<00:00:47.789> feet<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
people's feet and so now they kind of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.959 
people's feet and so now they kind of
offset<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> little<00:00:50.160> bit<00:00:50.399> which<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.730> good

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
offset it a little bit which was good

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.709 
offset it a little bit which was good
good<00:00:51.510> idea<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.030> significant

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
good idea and then the other significant

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.930 
good idea and then the other significant
change<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.550> replaced<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.859> upper

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
change is that they replaced the upper

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.740 
change is that they replaced the upper
to<00:00:59.960> emulate<00:01:00.960> more<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> sock<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.039> i<00:01:02.969> think

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to emulate more of a sock and i think

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
to emulate more of a sock and i think
that<00:01:03.840> was<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> great<00:01:04.110> idea<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.400> used

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that was a great idea because this used

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.899 
that was a great idea because this used
to<00:01:05.790> dig<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.619> foot<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.340> time<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to dig in to your foot over time this

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
to dig in to your foot over time this
hard<00:01:09.210> piece<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.799> not

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
hard piece right here is not it's not

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
hard piece right here is not it's not
quite<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.220> hard<00:01:11.490> anymore<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.299> overall<00:01:12.900> uppers

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
quite as hard anymore so overall uppers

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.580 
quite as hard anymore so overall uppers
pretty<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.580> know<00:01:14.670> very<00:01:15.570> flexible<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.560> know

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
pretty you know very flexible you know

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.929 
pretty you know very flexible you know
it<00:01:17.430> changes<00:01:17.939> form<00:01:18.270> real<00:01:18.509> easily<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it changes form real easily and then the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.719 
it changes form real easily and then the
last<00:01:20.970> change<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.229> i<00:01:22.619> could<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
last change that that i could see is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.730 
last change that that i could see is
definitely<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> bottom<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> bottom<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.710> see

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
definitely the bottom the bottom you see

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.240 
definitely the bottom the bottom you see
you<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.580> more<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.360> these<00:01:27.770> these<00:01:28.770> grooves

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you have more of these these grooves

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.910 
you have more of these these grooves
they<00:01:29.729> cut<00:01:30.030> them<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:30.360> places<00:01:30.740> on<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
they cut them more places on the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.350 
they cut them more places on the
five-point<00:01:32.460> oh<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.759> were<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:32.970> bigger

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
five-point oh they were a little bigger

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.620 
five-point oh they were a little bigger
the<00:01:34.280> difference<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.579> between<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> lines<00:01:36.240> here

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the difference in between the lines here

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.980 
the difference in between the lines here
they<00:01:36.990> were<00:01:37.049> definitely<00:01:37.259> bigger<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.979> then

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
they were definitely bigger and then

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990 
they were definitely bigger and then
they<00:01:39.990> made<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> different<00:01:40.770> material<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
they made it a different material it's a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.719 
they made it a different material it's a
little<00:01:42.270> harder<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.079> doesn't<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:44.130> doesn't<00:01:44.189> flex

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
little harder it doesn't it doesn't flex

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.899 
little harder it doesn't it doesn't flex
quite<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.210> much<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.720> around<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> arch<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
quite as much right around the arch and

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.510 
quite as much right around the arch and
I<00:01:47.909> me<00:01:48.210> still<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> same<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I me still do the same thing here but it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
I me still do the same thing here but it
doesn't<00:01:50.850> flex<00:01:51.090> quite<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.509> much<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.930> around

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
doesn't flex quite as much right around

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.520 
doesn't flex quite as much right around
the<00:01:52.320> arch<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the arch and I think that's going to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.719 
the arch and I think that's going to
alleviate<00:01:56.009> some<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> problems<00:01:56.490> people

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
alleviate some of the problems people

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.840 
alleviate some of the problems people
are<00:01:56.939> having<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.070> longer

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
are having when they would go on longer

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
are having when they would go on longer
runs<00:02:00.299> there<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> lot<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.439> complaining

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
runs there was a lot of complaining

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.380 
runs there was a lot of complaining
about<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.200> arches<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:05.340> don't<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.240> there's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
about the arches I don't know if there's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
about the arches I don't know if there's
a<00:02:06.450> lot<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.750> complaining<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:07.770> there<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
a lot of complaining but there there is

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.540 
a lot of complaining but there there is
definitely<00:02:08.550> some

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
definitely some

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.250 
definitely some

to the gym every day so I got my use out

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.630 
to the gym every day so I got my use out
of<00:02:56.260> those<00:02:56.440> they're<00:02:56.680> definitely<00:02:56.860> not<00:02:57.040> worn<00:02:57.400> out

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640

a<00:02:57.880> hundred<00:02:58.240> percent<00:02:58.510> yet<00:02:58.960> but<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.200> could<00:02:59.350> feel

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
a hundred percent yet but I could feel

a hundred percent yet but I could feel
them<00:02:59.770> on<00:02:59.950> those<00:03:00.100> longer<00:03:00.490> runs<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:01.350> 10<00:03:02.350> plus

them on those longer runs of 10 plus
miles<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:05.380> think<00:03:06.070> that<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.400> with<00:03:06.730> this

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
miles and I think that this with this

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.780 
miles and I think that this with this
new<00:03:07.090> material<00:03:07.270> is<00:03:07.960> not<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.040> wear<00:03:09.430> quite

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
new material is not going to wear quite

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.580 
new material is not going to wear quite
as<00:03:09.970> much<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.660> where<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.870> was<00:03:11.110> seeing<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.410> lot

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
as much this is where I was seeing a lot

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.810 
as much this is where I was seeing a lot
of<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.770> we're<00:03:12.010> right<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.310> rather<00:03:12.700> than

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
of the we're right here rather than

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.440 
of the we're right here rather than
where<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.150> foot<00:03:13.360> strikes<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.670> overall

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
where the foot strikes and so overall

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.620 
where the foot strikes and so overall
