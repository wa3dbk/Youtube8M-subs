00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:03.939
 all sewing times 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 can improve 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.369
 since only 25% of the time the sewing 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.690
 75% 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.010
 can be improved by improving movements that make the operator 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.109
 All movements that are made in sewing are subject to improvement 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.189
 one hundred percent but the time to sing because he bought me 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.539
 -muchly bad practices when singing people that starts the 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.760
 operation and at 8 10 seconds and has not yet started 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.220
 to grant 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.640
 this is because there 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.320
 we have been practicing 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.230
 part reach 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.520
 - how to take the piece in the way it is located 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.980
 in the preparation part that still all 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.920
 the grandchildren to donate tÃ©lam 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.250
 to abuse change the channels to start 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 there are also some forms 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.120
 of less time to do anything 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 the same with the podium I do not learn fabrics young days 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 and there is also especially the part to line up 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.340
 the terminal 4 stops the operator quiles a pact between strict of 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.150
 how long will the operation be delayed 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.270
 there are good good because good practices and bad practices 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 then they work in this way this to the movement we can pay them kind of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.079
 position 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.830
 in sewing like that too 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.830
 in standardizing machine parameters such as speed 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.220
 from the crpm rooms that display the steering wheel 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 michael biehn 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420
 the form 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.760
 in the part that has some content 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.760
 read that all this is correct makes the sewing equipment can lower 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.920
 the eef finish ensures sewing can also be shorter 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.810
 if the machine is in code and time 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.350
 and also of Aragon in this case amounts to some operations 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.140
 it is priority of the snowmobiles time auction of taco 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.899
 count 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.180
 the amount of auctions that are made 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.170
 in the case of court said 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.340
 in her 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.830
 an increase is also now allocated since 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 we were by many every correction movement 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.439
 from vido shakira 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.279
 it is not also the blades abound 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.980
 etc and also at the time of leaving according to how 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.899
 I arrived as it makes this movement 100 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.149
 do so 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.149
 appropriate for the next multilateral operation 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.540
 that of yesterday in all movement can be done 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.069
 timely improvements 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.319
 that will improve the times 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.319
 percent in the present convention 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:40.899
 n in this case 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.529
 regarding this portal 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.239
 we can be aware 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.590
 that any factory is that they have now 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.629
 using 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.849
 the methodology here 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.699
 later 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.529
 the text says 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:55.690
 to get better 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.090
 both the fashion couple and the product factory continued 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.339
 We have listened to many client companies 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.499
 that engineering area is not possible here because that company and a lot 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.589
 fashion in that and many changes 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:09.000
 but it turns out that the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.599
 basic movements 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.539
 they are repetitive then despite changing the candid reference fashion 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.939
 they are still basic of repetitive sunset resting prepare prepare 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.889
 then attacking palikot movement equal 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.199
 added a lot of change companies much fashion we will achieve improve the 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.199
 productivity 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.839
 in this event the doctor we ramos like 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.019
 an operator 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 in both that is above average 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.109
 not only in the speed with which he works but also worked as 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.669
 in the document is working 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.939
 let's put together is that the operator who possessed after the octave was worked 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.899
 I am not any movement in that area 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.299
 is not taking the two ends of the sleeve with one with each hand 

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:05.759
 aligned with him non-stop 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.230
 that the subject of cutting it 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.619
 adapted to make it easier 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:13.179
 The machine is also submerged 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:14.649
 idea 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:15.999
 take forward 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.900
 that is to say 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.340
 the operation is designed for Catalan 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 delay the shortest possible time 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.349
 of the class 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.229
 capital 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.409
 practically all the concepts of engineering methods 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.370
 of each of the movements 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.610
 we are achieving 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.189
 for the operation 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.539
 in three seconds per command 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.469
 the mayor a second 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.919
 by land 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.860
 where we have found companies that make this operation the same in 30 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.349
 seconds 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.699
 that is five times more 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.860
 then obviously the person the factory that is working 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.379
 with 30 seconds is a measure that is generating losses 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.539
 for p the market does not 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.249
 manages to pay this price 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.089
 the cost that is twinned 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:03.840
 in which this company that have 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.680
 p a time of 6 seconds 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.680
 Obviously, a very high profitability is working 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.969
 and also 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.389
 a lower income for the operators because we are achieving 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.330
 of not producing more units 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.900
 produces more waterlogged 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.389
 there is more 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.419
 ability to pay in the company therefore is where the subject in which all the 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.749
 world wins 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.229
 more are produced 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.800
 and that economic motivation is transmitted to the operator 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.789
 we are going to have a company where we have better salaries 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.210
 and at the same time we have 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.210
 one better is the greater profitability of silver 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.189
 will be tomorrow in your mail new videos of how to improve is not time for posture 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:45.539
 thank you
