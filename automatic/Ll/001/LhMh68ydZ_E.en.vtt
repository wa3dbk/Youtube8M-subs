19 faith shovel and its made by Corgi
it's<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> scale<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.800> 1<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:10.980> 76<00:00:11.580> which<00:00:12.300> in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
it's in the scale of 1 to 76 which in

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.690 
it's in the scale of 1 to 76 which in
the<00:00:12.570> UK<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.290> double-o<00:00:13.920> scale<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.460> used

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the UK is the double-o scale and is used

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.050 
the UK is the double-o scale and is used
for<00:00:15.030> model<00:00:15.839> railways<00:00:16.520> so<00:00:17.520> let's<00:00:17.699> start<00:00:17.940> by

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
for model railways so let's start by

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.849 
for model railways so let's start by
getting<00:00:18.330> out<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> box<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.619> small

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
getting out of the box it's a small

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.580 
getting out of the box it's a small
model<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.789> small<00:00:21.000> box<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.260> contained

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
model in a small box and it's contained

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.429 
model in a small box and it's contained
in<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.039> only<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.550> plastic<00:00:24.090> tray<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:25.080> forma

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
in it's only all plastic tray or forma

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.800 
in it's only all plastic tray or forma
just<00:00:25.949> pops<00:00:26.160> off<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.539> pull<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
just pops off and then you can pull the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.960 
just pops off and then you can pull the
model<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.580> it's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
model out and as you can see it's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
model out and as you can see it's
complete<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> box<00:00:31.199> there's<00:00:31.740> no

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
complete out of the box there's no

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.430 
complete out of the box there's no
assembly<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.460> anything<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> fit<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:34.170> model

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
assembly or anything to fit the model

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.470 
assembly or anything to fit the model
weighs<00:00:34.559> perhaps<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.489> bit<00:00:35.610> heavier<00:00:36.420> than

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
weighs perhaps a little bit heavier than

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
weighs perhaps a little bit heavier than
you'd<00:00:36.719> expect<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.129> quite<00:00:38.309> solid<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you'd expect so it's quite solid and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
you'd expect so it's quite solid and
robust<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> tracks<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
robust as you see the tracks all a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.840 
robust as you see the tracks all a
single<00:00:41.040> casting

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
single casting

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
single casting
I<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.390> moving<00:00:42.780> parts<00:00:43.079> other<00:00:43.200> than<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I know moving parts other than that the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.130 
I know moving parts other than that the
under<00:00:44.190> foam<00:00:44.399> obviously<00:00:45.300> rotates<00:00:45.690> compared<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
under foam obviously rotates compared to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.290 
under foam obviously rotates compared to
the<00:00:46.230> body<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.219> looking<00:00:47.520> around<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.879> body<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the body and looking around the body the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
the body and looking around the body the
details<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:49.020> fairly<00:00:49.230> simply<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.100> plainly

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
details are fairly simply and plainly

details are fairly simply and plainly
done<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> said<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.440> quite<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
done and with all that said it's quite a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
done and with all that said it's quite a
nice<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.219> model<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> look<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.239> this

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
nice little model to look at in this

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.380 
nice little model to look at in this
scale<00:00:55.129> now<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> boom<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> dipper

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
scale now the boom and the dipper

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.560 
scale now the boom and the dipper
they're<00:00:57.899> all<00:00:58.050> plastic<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.120> it's<00:01:00.120> ready

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
they're all plastic and it's ready

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.850 
they're all plastic and it's ready
reeved<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> box<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.000> done<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
reeved out of the box and it's done in a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.109 
reeved out of the box and it's done in a
smart<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:05.970> it's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
smart kind of a way really because it's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
smart kind of a way really because it's
just<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.450> piece<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> thread<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.830> unlike

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
just one piece of thread which is unlike

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
just one piece of thread which is unlike
a<00:01:08.640> continuous<00:01:09.150> loop<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.290> winches<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
a continuous loop the winches on the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.590 
a continuous loop the winches on the
model<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.159> work<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.030> does<00:01:12.180> allow<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
model don't work but it does allow it to

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.580 
model don't work but it does allow it to
be<00:01:12.840> posed<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:14.930> variety<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.140> ways<00:01:16.320> which

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
be posed in a variety of ways which

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.050 
be posed in a variety of ways which
which<00:01:17.130> helps<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> want<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> put<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
which helps if you want to put it in a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.740 
which helps if you want to put it in a
display<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.549> you've<00:01:21.030> got<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> few<00:01:21.509> choices

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
display and so you've got a few choices

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.090 
display and so you've got a few choices
there's<00:01:22.110> how<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> model

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
there's how you want to see the model

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.670 
there's how you want to see the model
look<00:01:24.020> although<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> tracks<00:01:25.409> are<00:01:25.560> non

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
look although the tracks are non

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.410 
look although the tracks are non
functioning<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> casting<00:01:26.880> details<00:01:27.060> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
functioning the casting details are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
functioning the casting details are
really<00:01:27.600> pretty<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> close

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
really pretty good so if we have a close

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.920 
really pretty good so if we have a close
looking<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> sprocket<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
looking at the sprocket in the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
looking at the sprocket in the
drivetrain<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.070> even<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
drivetrain you can see that even in this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.819 
drivetrain you can see that even in this
scale<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.409> represented<00:01:34.409> reasonably

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
scale they are represented reasonably

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
scale they are represented reasonably
well<00:01:35.009> let's<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.090> compares<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.570> 1<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
well let's see how it compares to a 1 to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.920 
well let's see how it compares to a 1 to
50<00:01:37.170> scale<00:01:37.380> model<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:37.979> AMD's<00:01:38.820> 20<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
50 scale model and this is AMD's 20 to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
50 scale model and this is AMD's 20 to
RP<00:01:40.290> face<00:01:40.560> shovel<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.820> it's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
RP face shovel and you can see it's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
RP face shovel and you can see it's
noticeably<00:01:42.420> smaller<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.380> wouldn't<00:01:43.590> want

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
noticeably smaller so you wouldn't want

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.490 
noticeably smaller so you wouldn't want
