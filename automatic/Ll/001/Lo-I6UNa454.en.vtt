today I will show you my Lego spaceship
that<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.390> made<00:00:06.600> it's<00:00:07.460> pretty<00:00:08.460> cool<00:00:08.610> pretty<00:00:08.849> big

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
that I made it's pretty cool pretty big

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.049 
that I made it's pretty cool pretty big
I<00:00:09.269> guess<00:00:09.480> it's<00:00:10.349> about<00:00:10.500> two<00:00:10.889> feet<00:00:11.099> long<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.759> think

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
I guess it's about two feet long I think

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.110 
I guess it's about two feet long I think
I<00:00:12.480> haven't<00:00:12.900> really<00:00:13.230> measured<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> but<00:00:14.490> you

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I haven't really measured it but you

I haven't really measured it but you
know<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.630> pretty<00:00:16.080> much<00:00:16.170> estimate

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
know you can pretty much estimate

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.720

here this is actually a transport unit
for<00:01:08.299> this<00:01:09.299> mining<00:01:09.869> tank<00:01:10.200> thing<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.770> I'll

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
for this mining tank thing which I'll

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.050 
for this mining tank thing which I'll
get<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> change<00:01:11.640> minute

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.000 

that<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.760> can<00:01:25.940> fire<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:27.170> has<00:01:27.380> these<00:01:27.560> guns<00:01:27.830> that

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
that you can fire it has these guns that

that you can fire it has these guns that
can<00:01:28.430> hold<00:01:29.420> up<00:01:30.550> just<00:01:31.550> like<00:01:31.760> that<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:33.530> fire<00:01:35.410> and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
can hold up just like that the fire and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.740 
can hold up just like that the fire and
this<00:01:36.680> can<00:01:37.450> whoops

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
this can whoops

this can whoops
you<00:01:39.380> know<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:40.130> thing<00:01:40.340> can<00:01:40.940> just<00:01:40.990> pop<00:01:41.990> off<00:01:42.229> and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
you know this thing can just pop off and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.020 
you know this thing can just pop off and
then<00:01:43.070> there's<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:44.979> mining<00:01:45.979> tank<00:01:48.850> which<00:01:49.850> has

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
then there's the mining tank which has

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.600 
then there's the mining tank which has
six<00:01:50.270> wheels<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.750> can<00:01:50.840> roll<00:01:51.250> it's<00:01:52.250> got<00:01:52.400> this

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
six wheels that can roll it's got this

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.150 
six wheels that can roll it's got this
crane<00:01:53.119> thing<00:01:53.540> that<00:01:54.080> can<00:01:54.470> rotate<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.070> right

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
crane thing that can rotate but right

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.450 
crane thing that can rotate but right
now<00:01:55.280> it's<00:01:55.400> hanging<00:01:55.670> over<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.940> edge<00:01:56.090> um<00:02:00.460> and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
now it's hanging over the edge um and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.270 
now it's hanging over the edge um and
then<00:02:01.990> has<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.020> satellite<00:02:03.649> dish<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.039> all<00:02:04.130> this

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
then has to satellite dish and all this

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.330 
then has to satellite dish and all this
stuff<00:02:04.690> cockpit

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
Thursday the engine room this can open

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.539 
Thursday the engine room this can open
up<00:02:49.070> quite<00:02:49.340> easily<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.769> then<00:02:52.070> there<00:02:52.280> there's

up quite easily and then there there's

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.590 
up quite easily and then there there's
two<00:02:52.610> droids<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.130> engine<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.350> ship

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
two droids and the engine to the ship

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.259 
two droids and the engine to the ship
and<00:02:59.600> that<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.049> close<00:03:00.230> back<00:03:00.410> up

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
and that can just close back up

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.090 
and that can just close back up
communications<00:03:02.269> tower<00:03:05.049> this<00:03:06.049> hook<00:03:06.380> that<00:03:06.890> can

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
communications tower this hook that can
