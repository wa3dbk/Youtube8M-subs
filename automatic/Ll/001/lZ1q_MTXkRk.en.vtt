00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.389 

for<00:00:00.240> the<00:00:00.299> second<00:00:00.719> time<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:01.620> dance<00:00:01.949> may<00:00:02.190> have

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
for the second time the dance may have

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.140 
for the second time the dance may have
got<00:00:02.610> themselves<00:00:02.760> level<00:00:03.419> again

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.940 

I<00:00:10.210> think<00:00:10.929> the<00:00:11.019> cross<00:00:11.259> takes<00:00:11.559> a<00:00:11.650> little<00:00:11.769> bit

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
I think the cross takes a little bit

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.190 
I think the cross takes a little bit
flexion

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
flexion

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.850 
flexion
if<00:00:14.500> the<00:00:14.620> pie<00:00:14.830> comes<00:00:15.130> inside<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.560> gives<00:00:17.740> these

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
if the pie comes inside and gives these

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.050 
if the pie comes inside and gives these
cross<00:00:18.100> I<00:00:18.250> think<00:00:18.520> it<00:00:18.610> takes<00:00:18.789> a<00:00:18.910> deflection

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
cross I think it takes a deflection

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.690 
cross I think it takes a deflection
that's<00:00:19.480> why<00:00:19.600> premier<00:00:19.930> can't<00:00:20.200> come<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:21.520> goes

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
that's why premier can't come just goes

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.190 
that's why premier can't come just goes
up<00:00:21.910> in<00:00:22.060> here<00:00:22.180> looks<00:00:22.420> up<00:00:22.599> in<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:22.869> air<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.050> be

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
up in here looks up in the air and be

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.350 
up in here looks up in the air and be
young<00:00:23.500> it's<00:00:23.680> a<00:00:23.740> super<00:00:24.130> header<00:00:24.340> but<00:00:25.300> a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
young it's a super header but a

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.100 
young it's a super header but a
deflection<00:00:27.090> takes<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.210> high<00:00:28.360> up<00:00:28.570> in<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.810> air

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
deflection takes a high up in the air

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.019 
deflection takes a high up in the air
and<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:29.470> think<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.800> flight<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.279> pool<00:00:30.520> means

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
and I think the flight of the pool means

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.700 
and I think the flight of the pool means
that<00:00:31.210> Vermeer<00:00:31.630> can't<00:00:31.989> come<00:00:32.230> and<00:00:32.439> this<00:00:32.529> is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
that Vermeer can't come and this is

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.490 
that Vermeer can't come and this is
great<00:00:32.829> head<00:00:33.130> of<00:00:33.160> them<00:00:33.340> beyond<00:00:34.200> he's<00:00:35.200> got<00:00:35.380> his

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
great head of them beyond he's got his

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.959 
great head of them beyond he's got his
eye<00:00:35.590> on<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.800> ball<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:36.220> he<00:00:36.309> hates<00:00:36.579> is<00:00:36.790> the

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
eye on the ball and he hates is the

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.330 
eye on the ball and he hates is the
clean<00:00:37.210> header<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.770> they're<00:00:38.890> back<00:00:39.100> in<00:00:39.250> the

going<00:00:39.579> PSV<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.750> crucial<00:00:44.110> little<00:00:44.530> nick

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
going PSV it's a crucial little nick

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.200 
going PSV it's a crucial little nick
isn't<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.250> just<00:00:45.550> sends<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.940> flight<00:00:46.180> of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
isn't it that just sends the flight of

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.510 
isn't it that just sends the flight of
the<00:00:46.390> ball<00:00:46.600> dropping<00:00:47.110> perfectly<00:00:47.890> between<00:00:48.070> the
