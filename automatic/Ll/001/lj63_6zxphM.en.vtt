00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
you buy at JC Penney so it's not that

there's anything wrong with that but

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.630 
there's anything wrong with that but
it's<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:30.439> American<00:01:31.439> Eagle<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.829> Jews

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's not like American Eagle or Jews

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's not like American Eagle or Jews
ticket<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.090> something<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.130> felt<00:01:35.520> pretty

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
ticket or something and so I felt pretty

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
ticket or something and so I felt pretty
confident<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.960> stuff<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.350> had

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
confident about the stuff that I had

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
confident about the stuff that I had
brought<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.250> thought<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.790> oh<00:01:38.970> well<00:01:39.390> my

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
brought and I thought that oh well my

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.690 
brought and I thought that oh well my
session<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> should<00:01:41.369> make<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> lot<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
session because I should make a lot of

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.840 
session because I should make a lot of
money<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.770> didn't<00:01:44.460> end<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.640> buying

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
money and so I didn't end up buying

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.969 
money and so I didn't end up buying
anything<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.799> see

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
anything because I don't really see

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.179 
anything because I don't really see
anything<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:48.740> after<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> hour<00:01:49.950> was

Plato's Closet and going there so you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.290 
Plato's Closet and going there so you
know<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.010> didn't<00:02:59.310> really<00:02:59.459> know<00:02:59.610> what<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.730> expect

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
know I didn't really know what to expect

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.390 
know I didn't really know what to expect
but<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:01.319> know<00:03:01.440> after<00:03:01.650> walking<00:03:02.069> around<00:03:02.280> in

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
but you know after walking around in

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.180 
but you know after walking around in
there<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.550> expected<00:03:03.180> more<00:03:03.330> than<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.659> but

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
there I expected more than that but

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
there I expected more than that but
whatever<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.970> don't<00:03:06.540> think<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.780> I'll<00:03:06.989> be

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
whatever so I don't think that I'll be

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.780 
whatever so I don't think that I'll be
going<00:03:07.260> back<00:03:07.409> there<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.950> buy<00:03:08.129> or<00:03:08.310> sell<00:03:08.340> anything

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
going back there to buy or sell anything

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.420 
going back there to buy or sell anything
I<00:03:09.239> don't<00:03:09.420> think<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.720> worth<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.110> also<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
I don't think it's worth it also the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.339 
I don't think it's worth it also the
clothes<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.150> they<00:03:12.269> did<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.930> thought<00:03:13.200> were

clothes that they did so I thought were

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.979
