so I have to regrip it I just kind of

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.039 
so I have to regrip it I just kind of
put<00:03:08.290> like<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.500> weird<00:03:08.830> little<00:03:09.010> eye<00:03:09.569> or<00:03:10.569> something

you adjust to it it takes like a week to
adjust<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.859> when<00:04:08.950> you're<00:04:09.100> pretty<00:04:09.280> much<00:04:09.459> fine

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
adjust and when you're pretty much fine

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.240 
adjust and when you're pretty much fine
it's<00:04:10.930> also<00:04:11.049> good<00:04:11.260> cuz<00:04:11.380> it's<00:04:11.500> super<00:04:11.769> light<00:04:12.010> so

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
it's also good cuz it's super light so

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.530 
it's also good cuz it's super light so
it's<00:04:12.370> really<00:04:12.489> easy<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.850> play<00:04:13.090> around<00:04:13.299> for

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
it's really easy to play around for

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.360 
it's really easy to play around for
shove-its<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.109> pivots<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:14.590> Tiger<00:04:14.829> claws<00:04:15.160> and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
shove-its and pivots and Tiger claws and

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.710 
shove-its and pivots and Tiger claws and
pelvises<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.090> all<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.359> junk<00:04:18.510> yeah<00:04:19.510> so

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
pelvises and all that junk yeah so

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.279 
pelvises and all that junk yeah so
that's<00:04:20.010> those<00:04:21.010> are<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.250> pros<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:22.090> cons<00:04:22.289> it's

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
that's those are the pros the cons it's

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.420 
that's those are the pros the cons it's
not<00:04:23.710> super<00:04:24.099> durable<00:04:24.400> I've

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
not super durable I've

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.320 
not super durable I've
this<00:04:25.639> for<00:04:26.440> four<00:04:27.440> months<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.460> tails<00:04:28.789> in<00:04:29.030> decent

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
this for four months the tails in decent

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.850 
this for four months the tails in decent
shape<00:04:31.000> it's<00:04:32.000> not<00:04:32.210> too<00:04:32.509> banged<00:04:32.810> up<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:33.680> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
shape it's not too banged up but the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.600 
shape it's not too banged up but the
nose<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:35.590> completely<00:04:36.590> mashed<00:04:36.860> in<00:04:37.160> every<00:04:37.460> way

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
nose is completely mashed in every way

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.150 
nose is completely mashed in every way
and<00:04:37.850> I've<00:04:37.940> never<00:04:38.120> even<00:04:38.380> run<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.530> into<00:04:39.680> a<00:04:39.800> curve

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
and I've never even run it into a curve

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.670 
and I've never even run it into a curve
this<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.550> just<00:04:40.759> from<00:04:41.030> like<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.570> don't<00:04:42.350> even<00:04:42.410> know

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
this is just from like I don't even know

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.409 
this is just from like I don't even know
what<00:04:42.949> it's<00:04:43.220> just<00:04:43.400> smashed<00:04:43.699> up<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
what it's just smashed up and like the

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.640 
what it's just smashed up and like the
rails<00:04:44.690> are<00:04:45.020> completely<00:04:45.500> shredded<00:04:46.030> from<00:04:47.650> just

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
rails are completely shredded from just

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.830 
rails are completely shredded from just
from<00:04:48.770> failed<00:04:49.340> flip<00:04:49.759> tricks<00:04:50.030> like<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.360> mostly

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
from failed flip tricks like a mostly

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.820 
from failed flip tricks like a mostly
ghost<00:04:51.110> drag<00:04:51.289> kick<00:04:51.530> flips<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:53.419> I'm<00:04:54.350> getting<00:04:54.620> a

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
ghost drag kick flips and I'm getting a

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.300 
ghost drag kick flips and I'm getting a
lot<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:56.380> cracks<00:04:57.380> in<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.860> top<00:04:58.130> fly<00:04:58.599> just<00:04:59.599> uh

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
lot of cracks in the top fly just uh

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.800 
lot of cracks in the top fly just uh
pressure<00:05:01.310> pressure<00:05:02.000> cracks<00:05:02.330> except<00:05:02.720> I'm

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
pressure pressure cracks except I'm

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.529 
pressure pressure cracks except I'm
running<00:05:03.229> soft<00:05:03.620> risers<00:05:04.130> on<00:05:04.280> it<00:05:04.460> 99%<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.449> the

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
running soft risers on it 99% of the

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.060 
running soft risers on it 99% of the
time<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:05.990> shouldn't<00:05:06.410> be<00:05:06.500> getting<00:05:06.680> pressure

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
time so I shouldn't be getting pressure

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.909 
time so I shouldn't be getting pressure
cracks<00:05:07.430> it's<00:05:08.360> just<00:05:08.599> because<00:05:09.229> the<00:05:09.349> board<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.680> so

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
cracks it's just because the board is so

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.920 
cracks it's just because the board is so
thin<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.550> it's<00:05:10.759> just<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.210> type<00:05:11.419> of<00:05:11.449> wood<00:05:11.780> they

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
thin and it's just the type of wood they

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.110 
thin and it's just the type of wood they
use<00:05:12.139> which<00:05:12.349> is<00:05:12.470> maple<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.550> plies<00:05:13.820> are

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
use which is maple but the the plies are

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.360 
use which is maple but the the plies are
very<00:05:14.300> thin<00:05:14.570> which<00:05:15.289> means<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.680> in<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.919> put<00:05:16.099> the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
very thin which means that in to put the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.860 
very thin which means that in to put the
individual<00:05:16.910> plies<00:05:17.150> are<00:05:17.389> more<00:05:17.539> likely<00:05:17.750> to

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
individual plies are more likely to

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.700 
individual plies are more likely to
crack<00:05:18.229> because<00:05:18.650> they<00:05:18.800> are<00:05:18.919> soaked<00:05:19.190> in<00:05:20.710> but

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
crack because they are soaked in but

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.930 
crack because they are soaked in but
overall<00:05:22.150> it's<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.330> sick<00:05:23.599> or<00:05:23.810> not<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.860> is<00:05:25.340> kind<00:05:25.820> of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
overall it's a sick or not it is kind of

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.189 
overall it's a sick or not it is kind of
thrown<00:05:26.479> to<00:05:26.780> a<00:05:26.810> wheel<00:05:27.020> bite<00:05:27.320> but<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.610> just<00:05:29.199> took

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
thrown to a wheel bite but I just took

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.740 
thrown to a wheel bite but I just took
20<00:05:30.620> minutes<00:05:30.650> you<00:05:31.099> know<00:05:31.220> carved<00:05:32.090> in<00:05:32.240> some<00:05:32.539> real

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
20 minutes you know carved in some real

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.480 
20 minutes you know carved in some real
Wells<00:05:33.050> actually<00:05:33.620> carved<00:05:33.889> in<00:05:34.010> my<00:05:34.130> own<00:05:34.280> wheel

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
Wells actually carved in my own wheel

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.070 
Wells actually carved in my own wheel
wells<00:05:34.760> let's<00:05:34.940> see<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.090> don't<00:05:35.210> think<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:35.930> can

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
wells let's see I don't think you can

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.589 
wells let's see I don't think you can
see<00:05:36.289> it<00:05:36.409> too<00:05:36.560> well<00:05:36.770> whatever<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.550> carved<00:05:38.449> in<00:05:38.570> the

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
general shape and then I sanded it to be

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.120 
general shape and then I sanded it to be
like<00:05:43.039> smooth<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:43.669> like<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:44.000> right<00:05:44.180> kind<00:05:44.750> of
