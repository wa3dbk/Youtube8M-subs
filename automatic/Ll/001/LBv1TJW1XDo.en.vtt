 I recommend with white or black clothes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.179

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.219

 take care a lot bye bye 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 this time I will use this 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.870
 palette that is called stay at pressure 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.420
 that I bought on the page directly from 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.080
 10 medical men and I will use the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.909
 shade more clarita mate that is a rose and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'm going to use it to light the bone 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.340
 of the eyebrow with a pretty brush 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.070
 small flat and then I return to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.409
 use the palette and I'm taking a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.450
 medium matte coffee as my color of 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.360
 transition and I will blur it from the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.360
 inner eye socket to the part 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.179
 outside and integrating it perfectly 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.069
 with the pink color that I used in 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.289
 the eyebrow bone I'm also 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.990
 using a pretty loose brush 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.420
 to help me in the process later 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.959
 he took a small brush of folds that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.090
 it is conical and I take the shade purple 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.490
 of the palette and I'm going to start 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.530
 intensify only what is 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.100
 near the eyeball or if it is the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.170
 fold but what is expected where it is and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 where the eye sinks where our 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 Ojito balloon that's where we're going to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.850
 apply the shadow and we will integrate it 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.830
 the change 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 this is an optional step can 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.509
 intensify it even more with a zone of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.970
 black color that is also in the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.040
 pallet and they can put it unique and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.170
 exclusively at the base of the color 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.950
 purple so you do not miss the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.870
 tonality nothing else believes more depth 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.760
 then returned to take the color rosita 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.360
 which applies to the brow bone with the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.280
 same brush and I will apply it on the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.200
 mobile eyelid what was left over from the eyelid 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.690
 mobile and if you want here you can clean 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 the area upload it as much as you 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.130
 want depending on the dimension that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.630
 they want to give the crazy is as much as 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.000
 they are going to rise and that nothing bad I am 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.850
 blurring so you can see the part 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.850
 initial of the tabs after I'm 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.620
 dealing with this plugin the brand of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.110
 cosmetic lakers that is pretty of the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.209
 editor I have taught them in others 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.569
 tutorials is pretty practical very 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.670
 precise and the ink is quite black like that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.380
 that makes the work of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.090
 delineated 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.280
 and then I'm using these 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.520
 new tabs of the house brand or 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.780
 flashes that look pretty natural 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.510
 I really liked them a lot. 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.240
 Scattered and partly hair 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.660
 human so they will last us a lot 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.060
 more time later I return to the palette to 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.760
 take the same purple color but with the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.950
 small flat brush to blur it 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.830
 below the eye to define the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.960
 lower lashes and that matches with 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.150
 the top also with the same 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.390
 brush return to take the same color 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.310
 matte coffee that I used as a transition and 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.290
 I will blur the edges of the color 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.380
 purple 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.570
 and intensify the outer part of the eye 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.490
 and as a last step then you have to apply 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.520
 mascara on the bottom 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.430
 and higher so they do not get lost and they 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.440
 integrate the inserts as this is the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.140
 final result for the eyes I hope that 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.950
 you liked it a lot and please do not 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.260
 forget to give little fingers up to this 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.140
 and that we will continue with the rest of 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.599
 the face that you can use a 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.060
 neutral lipstick any lipstick is going to 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.830
 to be this look however I wanted to 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.049
 go for the red color that as I 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.570
 they had requested here on the channel that 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.700
 They wanted the purple look in their eyes and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.700
 red on the sides I'm using my 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.639
 pencil eyeliner in cherry color of visu 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.280
 which is against water and I'm going to fill everything 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.380
 the space of the lips but only 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.900
 a pretty smooth base for the labial 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.570
 what am I going to use this is the brand 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.229
 two colors that I'm using over 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.000
 to give even more vibration to the look and 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.220
 apart from having a matte termination 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.350
