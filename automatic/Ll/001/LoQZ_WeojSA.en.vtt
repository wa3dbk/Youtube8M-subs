00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.453
How I passed my younger days

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.415
Now when I was born and
all of six weeks old,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.619
out I went into the street on
a hot summer's day.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.059
And I met a true old friend of mine,
who was a bottle ahead of me

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.938
and skittery with it.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.297
So we made a pair of oxen out
of mud, a cart and sacks to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.250
load onto the cart to take them off
to the mill and grind them.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.535
And so we went.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.260
In those days there was a water mill to
do the grinding, but it wasn't there.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.810
The miller was strolling up and
down on the water and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.338
so we asked him to call up the mill,
and he waved for it and shouted,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.572
until up it came and
we could start to grind away.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.493
Now, your man the miller
didn't have a scoop,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.732
so he pulled off my head and
used that as a scoop.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.973
So when we were finished and
off I went on my way home,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780
who did I meet but a shower
of women and young ones,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.339
who started to laugh at me.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.734
''What are you laughing at?'' says I.
''Ah, you don't have a head!'' says they.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.974
And that's how I knew I'd left it
behind in the mill.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.736
Back I went, put the head onto my neck
and off for home again.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.178
But the women and the young ones
were laughing at me again!

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.331
''Now what are you laughing at?'' says I.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.092
''Isn't your nose at the back
of your head!'' says they.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.733
So I gave my head a good twist to
set it right and off for home again.

00:01:58.687 --> 00:02:01.035
Now that's when I remembered
that I'd stuck my whip

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.939
the ground behind the mill pond.

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:07.016
Back I went again.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:12.752
But when I got there, what did I see
that a great big tree had shot up from it

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:17.047
and my old whip was up at the top.

00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.876
So up and up I climbed and
there at the top, what did I find

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:22.269
but a hawk chasing a whole
cloud of little birds,

00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:23.904
trying to catch them any way at all.

00:02:24.687 --> 00:02:30.544
Straight away the little birds one and
all flew right up my sleeves into my shirt

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:33.231
and right up my legs into my pants.

00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:36.846
Quick as a flash I tied up
my sleeves and pants,

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.493
and wasn't I happy that I'd caught
so many birds!

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:44.432
Yes indeed, and all these birds
in my shirt and pants

00:02:44.678 --> 00:02:46.995
started off chirping and tweeting,

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:50.569
and all of them giving off
in their own language,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.587
until up they flew with me and
carried me off far away.

00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:59.802
I saw the women washing and scrubbing
down on the edge of the Adriatic Sea,

00:03:00.052 --> 00:03:03.614
they looked up and shouted out:
Look at the big shrike!''

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:08.193
But I thought I heard them say:
''Loosen your shirt!''

00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:14.779
So that's what I did and out flew the
birds and down I plopped into the sea.

00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:20.071
I made such a big splash that
I emptied all the water out and

00:03:20.324 --> 00:03:23.167
the fishes were all left around me.

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:26.338
So I gathered up a fine lot of them.

00:03:26.587 --> 00:03:31.725
I didn't waste any more time there,
because I was far from home.

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:34.728
So I set off back, through Hotland.

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:39.340
Now Hotland is a strange country
indeed, where they don't build

00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:43.680
their houses on the ground but up
in the air at the height of a man,

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:45.731
so they need ladders to get in.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:50.222
The people in Hotland are all big
and tall, and everything there is big.

00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:55.164
Even the church was so big that there
were four hussars in there on horseback

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.457
and when the priest chanted
''The Lord be with you'',

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.427
one of the hussars spurred his horse
and went off quite a bit and he intoned it

00:04:03.678 --> 00:04:08.051
to the second, the second hussar
to the third, the third to the fourth and

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:09.938
he sang it to the respondent.

00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.424
So long was the mass that
the congregation could have done

00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:14.827
with a good breakfast.

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:20.973
But that was no problem at all,
since the altar was made of ham and

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.138
the candles were sausages.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:27.521
And just as big and tall was
the steeple of the church.

00:04:27.763 --> 00:04:32.936
When two carpenters were building it,
they dropped their hatchets and

00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:37.349
by the time one of them fell
to earth it had rotted away,

00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:41.491
and when the second was in the air
a lark nested in it

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:43.776
and hatched its chicks in it.

00:04:44.262 --> 00:04:46.500
The bell was so large,
the only way

00:04:46.751 --> 00:04:50.119
they could get it into
the belfry was to carry it up

00:04:50.364 --> 00:04:53.606
when it was a baby bell and
let it grow up there.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:00.471
It was hotter than hot there, so hot
that all they did was slaughter a pig,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.492
put it in a pan and put the pan out
the window and straight away

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:07.142
they had roast pork.

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:10.352
But I didn't waste too much there either,

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:13.678
I'd had enough and continued
on my way home.

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:16.772
That's how I got to Coldland.

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:22.510
It was so cold there that the white of
an egg would freeze so brightly

00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:26.207
that you could read a newspaper
by its light.

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:30.582
You couldn't speak there unless
you could read, because

00:05:30.827 --> 00:05:32.551
when one of them said a word,

00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:36.961
it straight away froze in front of him
and the other had to read it.

00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:43.068
But I didn't waste too much time
in Coldland, on I went on my way home.

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:48.849
By the end, I was getting so fed up
with the journey that I stuck my whip

00:05:49.092 --> 00:05:52.414
into the earth and climbed up
to the heavens.

00:05:53.026 --> 00:05:55.595
And there was my grandmother.

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:59.123
''The best of the day to you, Grandma.

00:05:59.368 --> 00:06:02.690
Do you have some bread
and jam for me?''

00:06:02.941 --> 00:06:07.748
''Oh dear, son'' says she, ''up here
we don't really eat.''

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:12.692
''You don't? Then how do I get down
from here quickly?''

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:18.911
Then an old man arrived and I told him
as well that I wanted to get back down,

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:23.051
because there was no bread and
jam to be had here at all.

00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:27.015
The old man remembered that
they had a chest of bran and

00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:31.160
if we twisted a rope out of it,
I could lower myself down.

00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:32.802
And as true as I'm here, we plaited
it fine enough

00:06:33.048 --> 00:06:34.566
but a mouse somehow got into it and
when I was lowering myself back down,

00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:35.373
didn't he bite through the rope!

00:06:35.617 --> 00:06:36.210
And I plopped down into the ground.

00:06:44.207 --> 00:06:48.100
I thought I was in Jászberény
somewhere near the church.

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:52.064
But I wasn't I was in Dósa,
at the edge of the village!

00:06:52.316 --> 00:06:55.524
And I was well and truly drilled
into the earth,

00:06:55.768 --> 00:06:58.451
so I shouted out for them
to dig me out.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.025
But no one came.

00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:06.440
So I had to go home for a spade
and dig myself out.

00:07:06.687 --> 00:07:13.903
And that's all I remember of my own
younger days and how I passed them.
