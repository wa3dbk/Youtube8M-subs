00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to point them out but we did test the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.510 
to point them out but we did test the
major<00:00:34.920> system<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.640> systems<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.870> RV<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
major system on systems on this RV and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400 
major system on systems on this RV and
so<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.640> tested<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> fridge<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.719> furnace<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so we tested the fridge the furnace the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.080 
so we tested the fridge the furnace the
water<00:00:40.649> heater<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.250> air<00:00:41.399> conditioner<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
generator and the water system that's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
generator and the water system that's
basically<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.930> verified<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> those<00:00:46.829> RV

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
basically it we verified that those RV

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
basically it we verified that those RV
systems<00:00:47.789> work<00:00:48.090> correctly<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.230> did<00:00:49.410> test

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
systems work correctly and we did test

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
systems work correctly and we did test
drive<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.670> seems<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> drive<00:00:51.239> pretty

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
drive it and it seems to drive pretty

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
drive it and it seems to drive pretty
nice<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.590> tires<00:00:52.829> look<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.280> an<00:00:53.430> older<00:00:53.789> set

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
nice the tires look like an older set

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
nice the tires look like an older set
but<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:54.449> don't<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.930> any<00:00:54.960> dry<00:00:55.410> rot<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
but they don't show any dry rot on it so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.880 
but they don't show any dry rot on it so
anyway<00:00:56.850> let's<00:00:57.090> take<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> look<00:00:57.629> around<00:00:57.890> one

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
anyway let's take a look around one

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
anyway let's take a look around one
thing<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.160> noticed<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.879> coachman<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
thing I noticed about this coachman is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.139 
thing I noticed about this coachman is
all<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.260> sidewalls<00:01:01.770> seemed<00:01:02.010> real<00:01:02.309> solid<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
all the sidewalls seemed real solid I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.719 
all the sidewalls seemed real solid I
don't<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.510> any<00:01:03.660> delamination<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.220> decals

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
don't see any delamination the decals

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.050 
don't see any delamination the decals
all<00:01:06.030> look<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.570> shape<00:01:06.930> um<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> although<00:01:09.030> I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
all look in good shape um and although I

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
all look in good shape um and although I
wouldn't<00:01:09.390> say<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.659> real<00:01:09.900> shiny<00:01:10.290> it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
wouldn't say it's real shiny it's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
wouldn't say it's real shiny it's
definitely<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.580> faded<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.330> they<00:01:12.570> normally

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
definitely not as faded as they normally

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
definitely not as faded as they normally
are<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.830> reason<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.220> coach<00:01:14.549> seems

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
are so for some reason this coach seems

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.490 
are so for some reason this coach seems
like<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> hasn't<00:01:15.420> seen<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> lot<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.049> Sun<00:01:18.500> alright

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
fine getting in and out of it so that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.880 
fine getting in and out of it so that
compartments<00:01:42.780> lacked<00:01:44.780> also<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.259> tires<00:01:46.500> um

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
compartments lacked also to the tires um

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.039 
compartments lacked also to the tires um
you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:47.970> look<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.329> they<00:01:48.450> might<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.659> older

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you know look like they might be older

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.539 
you know look like they might be older
but<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.560> sidewall<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.070> looking<00:01:50.340> real<00:01:50.520> good

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
but the sidewall it's looking real good

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.440 
but the sidewall it's looking real good
shape<00:01:52.040> they<00:01:53.040> don't<00:01:53.189> show<00:01:53.430> any<00:01:53.460> dry<00:01:53.909> rot

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
shape they don't show any dry rot

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
shape they don't show any dry rot
that's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.380> storage<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that's just storage and this

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
that's just storage and this

the right rear jack missing its foot and
the<00:03:49.769> springs<00:03:50.160> needed<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.850> retract<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.570> so

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
the springs needed to retract it so

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.500
