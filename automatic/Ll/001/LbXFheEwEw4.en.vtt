00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:05.390
 for sure they will wonder who I am and they do not care what matters is that 

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:09.690
 this is an interview where marcelo tinelli tells some intimate things 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.739
 run video 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.529
 hello viewers here we are with an interview Mr. marcelo hugo 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:16.490
 tinelli 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.919
 let's start with the first question 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.079
 what do you think about the people who criticize you as of the day 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.939
 good about the day I have to tell you that it really left me touched with what 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.899
 He said about my lands in Patagonia that my good friend Carlos Saúl Menem 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.390
 he said during his government 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.320
 all the celebrities have had a good time during their time because there all 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.520
 it was allowed people watched our programs and with that camouflaged 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.440
 how badly he was in the country back then 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.730
 We both benefited with the raiting and carlitos was better 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.490
 knowing that people did not realize how the country was raffling 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.790
 but good I went by the branches remembering the crazy years and not that 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.630
 talk about what you asked me 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.320
 d'elía said that I had lands in Patagonia that belonged to the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.440
 aborigines of the place and it's true 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.870
 I was half traumatized 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.740
 that's why I decided to give him more aduriz doing a self-criticism of my program 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.960
 saying pavote every two times and putting my dancers dancing the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.530
 cancan to the best lido style in paris 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.160
 but if you listen to my voice there is really a self-criticism saying that you 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.510
 program was a cabaret like the lido of paris 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.260
 but really days was referring to that your program was a brothel not 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.570
 for the cancan or something similar, but for how you put Monica farro almost in 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.120
 tits doing the dance of the shower and also when there is the dance of the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.970
 pipe where that affection that he spent hundreds of asses and shells gave him 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.000
 little kisses 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.710
 you were a son of a bitch who will be that you put two pipes 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.650
 good good better shut up than if he did not send you to hell and it does not appear is more 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.800
 by the screen 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.840
 I really always liked to do the dancing since the raiting was going up 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.640
 like boiled milk and that's why I put the musical of your dreams that is almost the same 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.530
 and I sent the big brother-in-law to hell because he supposedly did not give me the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.400
 raiting 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.020
 canosa rial angel britos and maría santísima were saying that the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.650
 intimate king with humor did not give me 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.590
 besides that in the special of pablo and pachu of the day of the country we spent 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.420
 so much money that we would have already paid as 25% of the external debt 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.230
 and that's why I decided to put my employees back as aldermen and go back to 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.249
 hire sluts that comes out cheaper 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.899
 and put the pipe back you mention braces so I have more reit 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:23.439
 inc 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.159
 and the other dancers who do the dance of the pipe with the tips now in 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.059
 the musical of your dreams 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.269
 I imagine that I have to pay him 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.299
 haha those dancers have to sign a contract that says they will be slaves 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.209
 mine and also the flat jope that the chato prada working on ideas from the south 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.579
 for that one cough this is the show and the casting of the TV 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.139
 and by the way I do not know if they realized that in the great brother-in-law of politicians 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.630
 when Francisco won in the mini celebration we did there was a guy who 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.569
 I handed out glasses of champagne 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.629
 Well, that guy who handed out the glasses was one of the written dreamers that 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.719
 I had hired for the dancing 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.309
 to see tell me a little more about what you do to get you the king thing 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:07.329
 well look I'll try anything with as long as I have good reit inc 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.739
 as the dance in the musical of your dreams only gave me twenty-one 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.699
 raiting points at most when the mother's day arrived I made that 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.339
 emotional encounter of the girl who had not seen her for ten years 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.379
 mother and how she gave me and rain tint that's why she got the guys from Chaco 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.569
 Look for you to give me an idea I do what I sing the hair of the ass I 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.170
 yes I want to put pachu and pablo arranging and cutting the grass 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.239
 from my house in punta del este I do it 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.169
 I do want that listorti go to the villa of olives to kick him 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.589
 the president I do 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.159
 I do want the feudal dwarf to dress as a witch and tell me 'I love you' 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.839
 I make 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:45.919
 I do want to put a bomb in southern ideas and destroy everything I do 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.019
 well that makes you wonder if it would happen but I would like to know 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.739
 say of the other people who criticize you 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.079
 among the few people who criticize me 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.859
 I say few because as I am one of the most powerful types in the media nobody 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.889
 I'm going to throw 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.010
 but well I tell you 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.709
 I remember when I was still with the great brother-in-law vip silvia soler had 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.780
 said in chronic tv that I did the narvaez political campaign and that I 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.790
 I was trying to fuck my employees 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.269
 and all that is true 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.559
 but I putting some very fat bundles of quiet lake removes 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.310
 just a few days later he said all that about me 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.310
 I invited her to my program to say that we are old friends and I obviously 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.570
 making me the mask that I get pretty good 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.050
 I do not know if they remember 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.620
 after something similar happened with jacobo winograd told you that great brother-in-law was the 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.419
 big lie 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.410
 and that my program was like a kind of ally of the Buenos Aires government 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.320
 and that the imitators of Mauricio Macri Francisco de Narváez and Kirchner were going to 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.310
 get to the final 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.650
 and as he said case the player the great law 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.259
 the city was the gate's priority in that area and lack of time Nestor Kirchner 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.810
 cristina fernández mauricio marquez criticism is to wait and the city in the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.840
 that social security is for you because global said 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.309
 in it the artist lived pisier will appeal 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:06.729
 The government is serious and towards Buenos Aires, but of course I also 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.139
 I shut up and I told campi to tell jacobo that he killed me 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.120
 the credifé cup 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.879
 I killed him 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.059
 for the Libyan lawyer general or Algerian and how did you hear said because 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.439
 I wanted to go because I am your friend 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.639
 ha really we are real friends 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.159
 but I love it when all those who threw themselves against me stay well 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.629
 Shut up your mouth for throwing yourself against Marcelo Tinelli 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.469
 Well let's take a little out of the current issues and tell me about something that 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.729
 happened a few years ago let's talk about when Susana Giménez said that your producer 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.860
 more than ideas from the south you would have to call ideas from your 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.360
 It seems to me that you should not talk about it this marie-jo 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.680
 with your we are friends 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.010
 and you make friends and you are not going to do it if you with susana giménez and 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.150
 mirtha legrand are the most menemista people that could be in the 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.289
 TV 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.680
 well marcelo I would like to keep pulling your tongue so that I 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.499
 tell many more things that you did about fifteen years ago but not 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:07.439
 I want the interview to be very long and I just wanted me to 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.400
 talk about the questions that says nothing more 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.840
 good to the people who are watching this video end of the interview
