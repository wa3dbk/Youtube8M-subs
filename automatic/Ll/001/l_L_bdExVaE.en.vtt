00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.600
 every component of the snail poison he has a precise and 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.759
 at the same time unique effect 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:13.570
 laola1 is to extinguish the fire to successfully drive a fish 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.779
 All the components of the battle need to work together to achieve the goal of efficiency 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.660
 Beautifully achieve this just to multiply scenario 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 One has in the end substances as the very specific effect of a day 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.599
 become 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.370
 thanks to research's scouting, scientists around the world understood 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.430
 Taste cones 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.080
 are not only dangerous 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.510
 it is next to the pharmacy, the same naturally occurring proteins that the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.130
 Had turned snails into high-precision toxins 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.819
 could be changed by science again 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.700
 this time 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.650
 In the human body a precise effect to develop pain too 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.300
 fight epilepsy 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.450
 even Alsheimer has death with medication 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.159
 this was produced by natural selection for a very specific purpose 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.000
 Achieving an effect within an animal park gives it a feeling of well and also 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 to smell physically is to feel like something is happening 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.580
 and exactly the same should be on medication so if you're after 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.590
 looking for a chemical that has an impact on the body 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 very suitable to start the search 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.320
 The genes of the cone snail change relatively quickly 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.960
 This means that they always produce new molecules from them 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 Researchers believe that they can be highly effective drugs 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.710
 Protect probably the taz at least one hundred thousand different viol 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.090
 clinical title episode of the hit series Emergency one that we only 2000 of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.999
 Knowing them is the potential for the discovery of the new Medicines Group 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.830
 Geigle snails are not the only source 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.990
 the Nikon those who are extracted from any of their poisons 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.310
 are says swathing fabrics had migrated 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.300
 the toxin up to three days 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.540
 That the blood harms its victims has evolved into a drug 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.689
 which prevents heavy bleeding during surgery 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:13.919
 People with certain brain tumors are already with us today 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.359
 radioactive versions of Scorpion poison traded 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.859
 Vilseck's incredible variety of poisons makes her so sudden 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.669
 March against Leon of malignancy in their development just means that we 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.170
 should find out how they work why they are not afraid so 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.900
 In the end, nature has everything 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.599
 Work done for us, we just have to find out what she has done 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.850
 as a killing machine or remedy 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.789
 Gift is one of evolution's most versatile innovations 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.489
 the animals will continue to be poisoned in their "fight for survival" 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.649
 leave 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:51.539
 but man 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.249
 could be from its ever-advancing development 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:56.039
 maybe the most benefited
