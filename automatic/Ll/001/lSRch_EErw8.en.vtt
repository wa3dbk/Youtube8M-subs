00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.000
 very good to everyone today I bring you something 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.320
 totally different and that is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 normally to go to bed to see me as 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.639
 I bring you things from pp patches no no no 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.259
 today I focus on the division of honor and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.689
 is that yesterday we had a very intense day 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.070
 yesterday we saw the climb 3 which is the 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.109
 good promotion I think some what 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 you know others not so much but yesterday 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.199
 they decided who would be the teams that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 will be accompanied in the next 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.650
 division d'honor let's make a small 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.599
 reminder and is that on the one hand 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 we had four teams in positions of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.690
 descent one was that he was expelled 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.920
 directly therefore not even in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.500
 Descent was out of competition 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.739
 then we have the bot team 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.600
 cerberus and 34 united yesterday they saw the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.550
 matches against the best of the playoff 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.440
 in this case the best at risk 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.910
 we have hellish bikers a 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.860
 infernal bikers who qualified 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 directly to be the winner of the play off 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.789
 and I wanted to be totally expelled 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.370
 they did not have to do anything more than 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.449
 go straight to the division of honor by 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.510
 another part we have the match between 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.699
 celerio pívots what happened with celeris and is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.840
 that we had a bots surprise at 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.789
 same as all division teams 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.500
 d'honor were required to maintain a 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.050
 percentage of players who played 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 in the final phase of the division of honor 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.220
 they did not respect him and for that reason 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 with an improper alignment so the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.270
 team of celebrities is classified before so 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.040
 known as electric reign and not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.259
 shopper and we're good because this team already 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 is within the honor division already 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.049
 later we will give you more information 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.610
 so you know the players that the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
 they compose theory you know biker 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.840
 enter the mind laws and now we go 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.939
 with the moment of tension and is that yesterday 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 we live a streaming of nobody else nor 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.679
 nothing less than six hours six hours of 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 streaming and we were fighting 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.710
 death to know the results the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.140
 The first party that composed us was the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.560
 of stars the third classified 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.209
 playoff against cerberus good what happened 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.670
 in this game it was a very match 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.140
 intense on the one hand cerberus monkey that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.479
 I was trying to keep the job 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.459
 they won the first game a game 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 not very long either was a game 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.240
 normal but in which they were very strong 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.470
 they showed all the power that he had 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 because he was in division of honor and he 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.069
 They thought first stars on the other hand there 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.289
 settle in the next game 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.660
 get ahead with 1 to 1 in the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.190
 scoreboard fought fair mind showed 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.680
 why they had been so long in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.090
 preparing this academy and so on and yes 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.769
 that took full potential and is that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.180
 I went ahead very easily won with 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.319
 an overwhelming victory also over 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 cerberus team this 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.060
 one by one, the tension party was coming 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.859
 when the two teams fought for that 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.719
 place for the division of honor and is that 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.999
 there they were fighting during a 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.099
 very intense game very tied until 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.569
 the last moment where cerberus us 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.249
 it showed why they were inside 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.870
 division of honor and they won a team 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.030
 of views that failed to show the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.760
 best of its facets and that is that you can 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.560
 they knew good to put carrier cerberus 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.329
 quite calm giving some other 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.219
 false step that did not have one of 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.349
 his best games and with it 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.030
 they managed to finish with the only 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.709
 equipment that stays in small 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.689
 podiums stays within the division 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.090
 of honor and is that they managed to reach 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.549
 2 to 1 and get directly into that 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.900
 plaza that they already had come they had to 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.060
 make sure to be back to those who were going 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.949
 to descend if they lost and finally the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.689
 match that closed one of the matches 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.030
 more intense that we have lived with 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.739
 a lot of emotion and is that on the one hand 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.049
 we have the team 34 there is no 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.239
 we remember was the fourth classified by 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 the tail had nine points fought up 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.669
 the end was even in the first 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.409
 positions at the beginning of the division 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.209
 of honor did not have anything easy 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.709
 last night and that is that even though 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.720
 they were close to staying within 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.650
 the division of honor when almost 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.959
 classify for him 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.700
 to fight with aces and pain gaming in the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.099
 match yesterday against the combined 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.920
 Experience had a really bad time 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.110
 start good we had a victory for 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.360
 part of the 34 united team the truth is 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.700
 that show a renewed face a face 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.170
 much stronger a team that swept 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.359
 with experience even though the game 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.069
 will lengthen and such a little get 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.290
 win pretty well they showed a good 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.760
 facet but in the second game some 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.959
 somewhat unstable picks we saw a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.980
 cillian that yes even though 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.099
 we had seen in other competitions 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.510
 high-level hovering did not end up being 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.859
 maybe one of the key points for 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.540
 try to take that game and that is 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.400
 the experience team took steps 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.900
 great gave strong passes and apart 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.700
 we also saw a change and that is to serve 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.319
 played with a lease in the jungle that was 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.430
 much more effective than the two parties 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.620
 they have the first and in the third 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.939
 match in this way with that and apart 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.319
 good team combinations 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.239
 espn arranged one by one in the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.489
 scoreboard again another match that 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.829
 he lived in the third game with maximum 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.160
 tension we had a match that lasted neither 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.870
 more or less than 61 minutes more than one 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.070
 party time there enjoying in 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.560
 tension because they were totally 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.930
 tied first it looked like 34 leads 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.680
 to the party leading later in a ruling 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.930
 in nacho 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.970
 Rafael getting a team fight more 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.410
 greater for the experience team 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.330
 when it seemed that experience was 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.190
 dominating came 34 net again it 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.780
 anteponía managed to win show the 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.030
 potential and the team fec and was wearing 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.590
 another nasser for them and put one by one 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.080
 is nations and this gives the comeback of 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.639
 new for 34 but again the team 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.350
 experience was again strong 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.360
 they get an inhibitor they were looking for the 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.160
 second with following as you reach a 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.199
 inhibitor got the third largest of 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.090
 heading that the second for them and 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.639
 they fought back there very strongly 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.009
 there was a very intense game and then 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.210
 61 minutes in a last triumph and 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.560
 totally decisive 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.750
 the experience team got 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.220
 rise with victory and with this we 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.810
 says who they are and who has the 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.070
 places for the next division of 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.690
 honor and is that of the teams that 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.400
 the teams that were 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.800
 have classified now are bikers 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.270
 infernal winners of the celerio playoff 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.830
 second position of the playoff 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.229
 they got from old plans that they did not 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.810
 it showed up due to improper alignment 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.479
 the team of cerberus that maintain their 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.039
 square just like last season 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.780
 and to top it off they are the team 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.490
 experience those who manage to win a 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.500
 34 team that did not make it easy 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.889
 but they got the victory and now 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.749
 they have 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.789
