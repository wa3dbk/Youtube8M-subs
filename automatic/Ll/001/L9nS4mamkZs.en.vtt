00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
thought I talked a little bit about the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
thought I talked a little bit about the
series<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> talked<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.670> bit

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
series and then I talked a little bit

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.389 
series and then I talked a little bit
about<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> thought<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:51.930> forever

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
about how what I thought about forever

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.799 
about how what I thought about forever
basically<00:00:53.399> should<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.270> grow<00:00:54.390> forever<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
basically should really grow forever a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.740 
basically should really grow forever a
book<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:56.239> werewolves<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.390> guess<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
book about werewolves I guess if you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.959 
book about werewolves I guess if you
want<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> call<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.370> but<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.430> really<00:00:59.730> liked

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
want to call it that but I really liked

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.779 
want to call it that but I really liked
that<00:01:00.120> Maggie<00:01:00.809> sort<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> did<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.550> about

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that Maggie sort of did the thing about

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.980 
that Maggie sort of did the thing about
wolves<00:01:03.300> rather<00:01:03.510> than<00:01:03.690> werewolves<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:05.990> people

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
wolves rather than werewolves the people

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.570 
wolves rather than werewolves the people
that<00:01:07.020> turn<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.380> wolves<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.040> more<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that turn into wolves it's more of a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
that turn into wolves it's more of a
wolf<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> werewolf<00:01:09.990> thing<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.890> get

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
wolf thing not a werewolf thing they get

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
wolf thing not a werewolf thing they get
bit<00:01:11.250> yes<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.270> turns<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:12.869> wolves

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
bit yes and that turns them into wolves

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
bit yes and that turns them into wolves
but<00:01:13.560> um<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.000> changes<00:01:15.540> them<00:01:15.720> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but um just to do what changes them is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
but um just to do what changes them is
the<00:01:16.680> temperature<00:01:17.009> outside<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> full

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
moon and it's kind of like a disease

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.030 
moon and it's kind of like a disease
really<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> werewolf<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.470> thing

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
really more than like a werewolf a thing

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.649 
really more than like a werewolf a thing
the<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> lot<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.090> people<00:01:24.240> love

didn't<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> had<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.619> series<00:01:52.619> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
didn't think it had to be a series you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.780 
didn't think it had to be a series you
know<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.340> loved<00:01:54.000> shiver<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.340> a

Kaissa<00:01:57.149> particular<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> lot<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> those

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
Kaissa particular and a lot of those

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.289 
Kaissa particular and a lot of those
people<00:01:58.500> are<00:01:58.799> huge<00:01:59.280> fans<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.759> salmon<00:02:00.090> grace

together<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.740> their<00:02:01.920> love<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
together I think that their love is

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.450 
together I think that their love is
incredible<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.409> true<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
incredible and that it's true and that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.740 
incredible and that it's true and that

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
book didn't care about them at all and

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.830 
book didn't care about them at all and
it's<00:03:07.290> not<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:07.740> they<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.300> written<00:03:09.540> well

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's not that they it was written well

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.750 
it's not that they it was written well
they're<00:03:10.230> parts<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.100> think<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.490> that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
they're parts and I think it's just that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.280 
they're parts and I think it's just that
you<00:03:11.910> know<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> same<00:03:12.390> conflict<00:03:12.840> over<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
you know it's the same conflict over and

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.930 
you know it's the same conflict over and
over<00:03:13.380> for<00:03:13.620> them<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.130> they<00:03:14.610> were<00:03:14.640> so

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
over for them and and they were so

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.460 
over for them and and they were so
perfect<00:03:15.300> together<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.050> almost<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.410> got

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
perfect together that it almost just got

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.280 
perfect together that it almost just got
boring<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:17.160> read<00:03:17.340> about<00:03:17.489> them<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.840> found

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
boring to read about them and so I found

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.990 
boring to read about them and so I found
myself<00:03:19.470> like<00:03:19.860> waiting<00:03:20.280> for<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.580> coal<00:03:20.790> and
