is<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> simplification<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.759> processes<00:01:15.450> we

ignore but we may not have dragons but
the<00:01:20.909> world<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.420> cool<00:01:21.659> place<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the world is a pretty cool place the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 
the world is a pretty cool place the
game<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.890> reminds<00:01:23.399> you<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.640> as

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
game like this reminds you of that as

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
game like this reminds you of that as
well<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.360> providing<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.899> relaxing<00:01:25.500> contrast<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
well as providing a relaxing contrast to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.430 
well as providing a relaxing contrast to
what<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.810> were<00:01:27.930> probably<00:01:28.290> playing<00:01:28.680> before

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.440 

storm<00:01:37.440> is<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> puzzle<00:01:38.250> game<00:01:38.280> based<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.970> physics

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
storm is a puzzle game based on physics

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.590 
storm is a puzzle game based on physics
and<00:01:39.950> nature<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.460> levels<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.420> more

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and nature it's levels are little more

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
and nature it's levels are little more
than<00:01:42.659> rocks<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.500> trees<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.310> grass<00:01:44.550> here<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
than rocks and trees some grass here and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
than rocks and trees some grass here and
there<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.509> all's<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.750> few<00:01:45.960> patches<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.409> dirt

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
there so all's a few patches of dirt

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.430 
there so all's a few patches of dirt
it's<00:01:47.250> basically<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:48.030> nature<00:01:48.450> simulator<00:01:49.020> you

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
it's basically a nature simulator you

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's basically a nature simulator you
have<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> seeds<00:01:50.220> from<00:01:50.580> full-grown

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
have to get the seeds from full-grown

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.570 
have to get the seeds from full-grown
trees<00:01:51.690> to<00:01:52.259> those<00:01:52.409> bare<00:01:52.800> patches<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.429> earth

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
trees to those bare patches of earth

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.850 
trees to those bare patches of earth
once<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.300> seeds<00:01:54.539> are<00:01:54.690> planted<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.289> to<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
once the seeds are planted on to the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
once the seeds are planted on to the
next<00:01:56.039> level<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.240> Mother<00:01:57.509> Earth<00:01:57.840> bound

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
next level it's like Mother Earth bound

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
next level it's like Mother Earth bound
obviously<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> game<00:02:00.149> centers<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.929> moving<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
obviously the game centers on moving the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.370 
obviously the game centers on moving the
seeds<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:02.970> touch<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.899> your

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
seeds can actually touch them so your

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.170 
seeds can actually touch them so your
only<00:02:04.560> option<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.250> use<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.729> elements

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
only option is to use the elements

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.630 
only option is to use the elements
create<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> wind<00:02:07.020> gust<00:02:07.320> caused<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> downpour

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
create a wind gust caused a downpour

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.490 
create a wind gust caused a downpour
whatever<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> takes<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.750> get<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.019> seed<00:02:10.259> from

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
whatever it takes to get the seed from

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.160 
whatever it takes to get the seed from
tree<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.100> soil<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.970> starts<00:02:12.360> easy<00:02:12.570> enough<00:02:12.930> but

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
tree to soil it starts easy enough but

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.880 
tree to soil it starts easy enough but
as<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.709> seasons<00:02:14.160> change<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:15.060> storm<00:02:15.510> gets

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
as the seasons change the storm gets

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:28.820 
as the seasons change the storm gets
unexpectedly<00:02:16.890> complex

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.350 

so<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.890> works<00:02:30.070> like<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.640> start<00:02:30.700> with<00:02:31.090> one

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
so it works like this you start with one

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.110 
so it works like this you start with one
seed-bearing<00:02:31.750> tree<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.620> limited<00:02:33.580> elements

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
seed-bearing tree and limited elements

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.550 
seed-bearing tree and limited elements
generally<00:02:34.480> there's<00:02:34.990> no<00:02:35.140> way<00:02:35.260> you're<00:02:35.440> getting

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
generally there's no way you're getting

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.320 
generally there's no way you're getting
that<00:02:35.770> seed<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.520> dirt<00:02:36.730> without<00:02:36.880> getting

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
that seed to the dirt without getting

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.120 
that seed to the dirt without getting
more<00:02:37.600> elements<00:02:38.110> which<00:02:38.410> are<00:02:38.530> scattered<00:02:38.980> around

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
more elements which are scattered around

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.090 
more elements which are scattered around
the<00:02:39.340> stage<00:02:39.610> there<00:02:40.150> are<00:02:40.240> wind<00:02:40.510> orbs<00:02:41.020> rain<00:02:41.560> orbs

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the stage there are wind orbs rain orbs

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.920 
the stage there are wind orbs rain orbs
lightning<00:02:42.610> orbs<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:43.360> need<00:02:43.540> all<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.720> them

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
lightning orbs and you need all of them

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.070 
lightning orbs and you need all of them
to<00:02:44.170> move<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.620> seeds<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:45.850> each<00:02:46.090> element<00:02:46.720> can

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
in the same spot which can cost far more

serious<00:02:56.290> flooding<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:57.160> two<00:02:57.310> lightning<00:02:57.580> bolts
