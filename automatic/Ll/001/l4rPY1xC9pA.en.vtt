using<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.130> matte<00:02:26.340> shade<00:02:26.730> here<00:02:27.150> then<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.630> are<00:02:27.660> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
using a matte shade here then you are a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.570 
using a matte shade here then you are a
shimmer<00:02:28.230> one<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> put<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> little<00:02:32.400> bit<00:02:32.490> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
shimmer one going to put a little bit of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.220 
shimmer one going to put a little bit of
a<00:02:32.640> scar<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:32.940> next<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.510> then<00:02:33.570> we're<00:02:34.050> going<00:02:34.140> to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
a scar on next and then we're going to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.320 
a scar on next and then we're going to
put<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.530> some<00:02:34.560> eyelashes<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.670> these

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
put on some eyelashes and these

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.540 
put on some eyelashes and these
eyelashes<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.050> tad<00:02:37.470> too<00:02:37.830> long<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.370> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
eyelashes are a tad too long and the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.460 
eyelashes are a tad too long and the
reason<00:02:38.970> being<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.330> because<00:02:39.360> they<00:02:40.050> pull<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
reason being is because they pull the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.890 
reason being is because they pull the
eye<00:02:40.500> down<00:02:40.650> ever<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:41.490> slightly<00:02:41.820> giving<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.780> a

eye down ever so slightly giving it a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.100 
eye down ever so slightly giving it a
very<00:02:43.200> sleepy<00:02:44.040> dreamy<00:02:44.490> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.940> look<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.900> I'm
