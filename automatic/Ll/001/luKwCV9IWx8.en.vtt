00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
out enemies ends up the other streak the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
out enemies ends up the other streak the
assault<00:01:46.229> drone<00:01:46.380> obviously<00:01:46.770> follows<00:01:47.010> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
assault drone obviously follows you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.100 
assault drone obviously follows you
around<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.580> bombing<00:01:47.970> run<00:01:48.150> can<00:01:48.390> also<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
around but bombing run can also kind of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
around but bombing run can also kind of
hit<00:01:49.620> through<00:01:49.830> those<00:01:49.979> windows<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.610> kill<00:01:50.790> guys

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
hit through those windows and kill guys

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850 
hit through those windows and kill guys
that<00:01:51.150> are<00:01:51.240> inside<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.470> once<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.830> of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that are inside of that at once out of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.840 
that are inside of that at once out of
the<00:01:52.979> building<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.340> other<00:01:53.460> side<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> little

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the building the other side is a little

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.640 
the building the other side is a little
more<00:01:54.060> protected<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.780> other<00:01:54.990> than<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.290> other

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
more protected but other than that other

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.710 
more protected but other than that other
than<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.950> two<00:01:56.130> sides<00:01:56.400> most<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.240> map<00:01:57.479> is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
than the two sides most of the map is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.530 
than the two sides most of the map is
outdoor<00:01:58.620> and<00:01:58.860> very<00:01:59.100> open<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> good

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
outdoor and very open so it is a good

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.600 
outdoor and very open so it is a good
map<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.990> run<00:02:01.200> lethal<00:02:01.620> Zand<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.220> you're<00:02:02.340> looking

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
map to run lethal Zand if you're looking

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
map to run lethal Zand if you're looking
to<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:02.760> honor<00:02:02.970> plus<00:02:03.240> kills<00:02:03.540> green<00:02:03.900> band<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to get honor plus kills green band I

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.930 
to get honor plus kills green band I
guess<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.830> good<00:02:04.920> map<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.640> personally

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
guess is a good map I just personally

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.640 
guess is a good map I just personally
and<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.510> a<00:02:06.540> fan<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.320> play<00:02:07.500> at

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and not a fan of it I don't play at

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.990 
and not a fan of it I don't play at
lunch<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.250> guess<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.459> why<00:02:08.759> i<00:02:08.789> don't

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
lunch which I guess is why i don't

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.789 
lunch which I guess is why i don't
really<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.659> because<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> map<00:02:10.649> you

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
really like it because to like a map you

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.619 
really like it because to like a map you
got<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.099> familiar<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.569> able

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
got to be familiar with it and be able

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.300 
got to be familiar with it and be able
to<00:02:12.780> do<00:02:12.900> well<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.500> i<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.709> never<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.040> well

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
to do well on it and i can never do well

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.680 
to do well on it and i can never do well
on<00:02:14.519> this<00:02:14.670> map<00:02:14.909> but<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.209> probably<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:15.569> i

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
on this map but it's probably because i

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
on this map but it's probably because i
don't<00:02:15.900> like<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.170> play<00:02:16.409> it<00:02:16.560> much<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.890> every

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
don't like to play it much and every

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.890 
don't like to play it much and every
