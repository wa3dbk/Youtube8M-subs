 That is, the file uploaded by My Player is applied or 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.880
 Now I want to make sure that those who make up my game work best with my game. 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:19.360

 Once you have entered the options, go to the game settings slider here n

 There's a slide. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.760
 Now, if you change this, the right side of this change will of course change in the cheat engine 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.380
 It is. 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:36.190
 Conversely , if you change a lot of English into English when you switch from the JT engine 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.310
 You both have to check if it applies to the Yogi game . 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.420

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.629
 It's possible 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:57.420
 Let's go check this one out. 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:02.789
 The value is something like 1 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 If you do, it will change like this, of course . 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.780
 Being 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.780
 Now go to MyCarrier. 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.770
 I 'll check to see if it really is . 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.729
 Then just go to the next boundary in the game 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.729
 By doing 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 Yes. Think about it for a minute before you jump on the jumper. You have to change it now. 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:05.490
 You have to change this with the game. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 You know, now that you change her, 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.930
 That is, it continues to apply 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:18.290
 Anyway, go into the game and turn it off. 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:24.020
 I am now confirmed , I changed the success rate of 100% to 1, 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.740
 Success 100% of the bar , even if the defender in the three of my dreams, even if the unconditional

 Pass eel smartly converges into bread and once it enters, it is like this 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.590

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.080
