the interesting thing with the
Quattroporte<00:04:50.570> though<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:52.070> performance

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
Quattroporte though is the performance

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.090 
Quattroporte though is the performance
of<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.820> engine<00:04:52.940> is<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.270> little<00:04:53.720> bit<00:04:53.840> misleading

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
of the engine is a little bit misleading

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.280 
of the engine is a little bit misleading
because<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.310> feels<00:04:55.730> like<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.450> smaller<00:04:56.900> car

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
because it feels like a smaller car

until you get to a corner the straight
line<00:05:00.110> performance<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.680> think<00:05:00.710> it's<00:05:01.100> a

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
line performance I think it's a

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.090 
line performance I think it's a
medium-sized<00:05:02.300> sedan<00:05:02.600> tip<00:05:03.500> it<00:05:03.620> into<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.830> corner

though and all of a sudden the sheer
size<00:05:06.440> of<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.860> car<00:05:07.100> becomes<00:05:07.670> a<00:05:07.820> parrot<00:05:08.120> because

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
size of the car becomes a parrot because

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.720 
size of the car becomes a parrot because
there's<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.140> lot<00:05:09.470> of<00:05:09.620> weight<00:05:09.800> moving<00:05:10.100> around<00:05:10.460> in
