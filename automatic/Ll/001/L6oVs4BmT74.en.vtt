our<00:05:48.420> Kawasaki<00:05:49.350> multi-disc<00:05:50.040> wet<00:05:50.310> rear<00:05:50.490> brake

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
our Kawasaki multi-disc wet rear brake

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.200 
our Kawasaki multi-disc wet rear brake
so<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.690> rear<00:05:51.900> brake<00:05:52.200> on<00:05:52.440> these<00:05:52.740> is<00:05:53.010> built<00:05:53.820> into

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
so the rear brake on these is built into

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.240 
so the rear brake on these is built into
this<00:05:54.360> rear<00:05:54.660> differential<00:05:55.410> and<00:05:55.830> it's<00:05:55.950> actually

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
this rear differential and it's actually

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.890 
this rear differential and it's actually
on<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.400> drive<00:05:56.640> shaft<00:05:56.970> coming<00:05:57.240> back<00:05:57.450> right<00:05:57.750> up

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
on the drive shaft coming back right up

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.350 
on the drive shaft coming back right up
there<00:05:58.110> so<00:05:58.710> if<00:05:58.830> we<00:05:58.920> can<00:05:59.100> get<00:05:59.250> it<00:05:59.340> as<00:05:59.430> soon<00:05:59.700> right

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
there so if we can get it as soon right

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.990 
there so if we can get it as soon right
right<00:06:01.290> up<00:06:01.470> in<00:06:01.620> there<00:06:01.800> is<00:06:01.980> that<00:06:02.160> that<00:06:02.610> brake<00:06:03.000> and

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
right up in there is that that brake and

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.300 
right up in there is that that brake and
it's<00:06:06.000> awesome<00:06:06.240> it<00:06:06.600> rides<00:06:07.500> in<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.830> same<00:06:08.040> all

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
it's awesome it rides in the same all

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.130 
it's awesome it rides in the same all
that<00:06:08.550> this<00:06:08.760> that<00:06:09.210> these<00:06:09.390> gears<00:06:09.690> right<00:06:09.900> again

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
that this that these gears right again

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.460 
that this that these gears right again
so<00:06:10.320> it's<00:06:10.470> a<00:06:10.530> multi-disc<00:06:11.130> wet<00:06:11.550> rear<00:06:11.820> brake<00:06:12.120> and

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
so it's a multi-disc wet rear brake and

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.200 
so it's a multi-disc wet rear brake and
