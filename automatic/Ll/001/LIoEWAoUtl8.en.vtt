00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.149 
think about it from a legal standpoint
it<00:02:03.780> would<00:02:03.899> break<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> back<00:02:04.469> at<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> coalition

they grandfathered in 28,000 licenses
you<00:02:08.039> know<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.580> basically<00:02:08.759> take<00:02:09.060> away

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
you know it would basically take away

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.050 
you know it would basically take away

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
orders hence our funding in our case so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760 
orders hence our funding in our case so
you<00:02:13.790> know<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.330> are<00:02:14.510> 500<00:02:14.989> impact<00:02:15.290> statements

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.440 
you know and are 500 impact statements
because<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.220> would<00:02:16.340> be<00:02:16.430> relevant<00:02:16.819> if<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.270> got

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
because it would be relevant if you got

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630 
because it would be relevant if you got
your<00:02:17.540> license<00:02:17.870> back<00:02:18.340> however<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.489> believe

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
your license back however I believe

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.520 
your license back however I believe
there<00:02:19.910> would<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.090> sectional<00:02:20.569> section<00:02:21.410> eight

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
there would be a sectional section eight

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.040 
there would be a sectional section eight
I<00:02:21.560> think<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> or<00:02:22.130> section<00:02:22.459> 11<00:02:22.790> equality<00:02:23.780> chart

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
I think it or section 11 equality chart

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.800 
I think it or section 11 equality chart
challenge<00:02:24.620> for<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.459> Charter<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.720> know

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
challenge for the Charter so you know

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.240 
challenge for the Charter so you know
you<00:02:26.870> were<00:02:27.080> all<00:02:27.200> equal<00:02:27.530> before<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.980> under<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
you were all equal before and under the

you were all equal before and under the
