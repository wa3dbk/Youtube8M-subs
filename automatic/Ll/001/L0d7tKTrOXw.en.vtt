00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
standard road markings here are some

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.769 
standard road markings here are some

examples here the road markings state

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.900 
examples here the road markings state
that<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.260> traffic<00:00:19.619> taking<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> left<00:00:20.609> lane

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that all traffic taking the left lane

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.890 
that all traffic taking the left lane
must<00:00:21.630> turn<00:00:22.260> left<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> reason<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.600> you

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
must turn left the reason for this you

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.019 
must turn left the reason for this you
will<00:00:25.019> notice<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.769> approach<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.760> because

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
will notice as we approach is because

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.750 
will notice as we approach is because
there<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.390> no<00:00:27.480> give<00:00:27.990> way<00:00:28.260> line<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.460> means

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
there is no give way line and this means

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240 
there is no give way line and this means
that<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.269> long<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.810> stay<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.590> lane<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
that as long as we stay in this lane and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.260

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.570 
also see that either lane is acceptable

the roundabout is not well marked so we

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.960
