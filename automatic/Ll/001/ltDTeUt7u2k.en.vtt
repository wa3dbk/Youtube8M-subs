strange reason Majora's Mask I thought

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.430 
strange reason Majora's Mask I thought
was<00:02:38.670> creepy<00:02:38.940> as<00:02:39.269> hell<00:02:39.810> growing<00:02:40.290> up

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
was creepy as hell growing up

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.860 
was creepy as hell growing up
specifically<00:02:41.220> seeing<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> moon's<00:02:42.060> face<00:02:42.510> I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
specifically seeing the moon's face I

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.569 
specifically seeing the moon's face I
always<00:02:43.319> thought<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.709> some<00:02:43.920> creepy<00:02:44.250> like

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579

me<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:46.950> hurt<00:02:47.190> me<00:02:47.220> that's<00:02:47.459> honestly<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.150> was

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
me or hurt me that's honestly what I was

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.759 
me or hurt me that's honestly what I was
thinking<00:02:48.599> when<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:48.959> 9<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.290> 10<00:02:49.440> years<00:02:49.620> old

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
thinking when I was 9 to 10 years old

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.140 
thinking when I was 9 to 10 years old
playing<00:02:50.250> Majora's<00:02:50.670> Mask

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
playing Majora's Mask

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.910 
playing Majora's Mask
not<00:02:51.299> only<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.629> Majora's<00:02:52.019> Mask<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.440> by<00:02:52.620> far<00:02:52.889> I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
not only that Majora's Mask is by far I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.710 
not only that Majora's Mask is by far I
thought<00:02:53.190> one<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.549> more<00:02:53.700> hardest<00:02:54.450> games

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
thought one of the more hardest games

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.869 
thought one of the more hardest games
compared<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> Ocarina<00:02:55.829> of<00:02:55.859> Time<00:02:56.159> specifically

dungeon on that particular game was one

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.970 
dungeon on that particular game was one

Nintendo actually remaking every single
Zelda<00:03:10.500> game<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.859> for<00:03:11.519> example<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.879> Legend<00:03:12.420> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
with you know modern 30s graphics I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.140 
with you know modern 30s graphics I
think<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.799> would<00:03:16.950> sell<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.489> make<00:03:17.609> hundreds

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
think that would sell and make hundreds

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.819 
think that would sell and make hundreds
millions<00:03:18.359> of<00:03:18.690> dollars<00:03:19.049> because<00:03:19.290> Zelda<00:03:19.620> fans

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
millions of dollars because Zelda fans

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.319 
millions of dollars because Zelda fans
like<00:03:20.010> yourself<00:03:20.400> in<00:03:20.519> mind<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:21.090> just

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
more sad news and this is one of my

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.289 
more sad news and this is one of my
biggest<00:03:28.769> problems<00:03:29.069> with<00:03:29.370> giant<00:03:29.699> corporations

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
biggest problems with giant corporations

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.360 
biggest problems with giant corporations
like<00:03:30.569> this<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.169> don't<00:03:31.500> see<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.980> reason<00:03:32.099> that

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
like this is I don't see the reason that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.309 
like this is I don't see the reason that
they're<00:03:32.549> doing<00:03:32.579> this<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.120> understand<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:34.169> is

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
they're doing this I understand that is

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.099 
they're doing this I understand that is
their<00:03:34.530> digital<00:03:34.980> property<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.239> when<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.870> comes

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
their digital property but when it comes

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.170 
their digital property but when it comes
to<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.379> movie<00:03:37.859> trailer<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.060> is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
to a movie trailer I think this is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.119 
to a movie trailer I think this is
overkill<00:03:39.690> when<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> giant<00:03:40.379> corporation<00:03:40.919> wants

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
overkill when a giant corporation wants

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.129 
overkill when a giant corporation wants
to<00:03:41.370> literally<00:03:41.730> ruin<00:03:42.120> one<00:03:42.389> person's<00:03:42.900> life<00:03:43.109> for

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
to literally ruin one person's life for
