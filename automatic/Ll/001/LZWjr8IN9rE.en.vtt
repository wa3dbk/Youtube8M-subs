 doshirak yes massage today and went to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.219
 the store here and our sight fell on doshirak 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.940
 precisely here on such why because 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.940
 the wrapper is very comfortable and very beautiful 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.280
 she is red but she can be colorful 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 most pleased what taste I like 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 i value them like packaging if 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 honestly i would eat the packaging but not and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 package deal to the general case 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.680
 opening now I don't know how not here 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.739
 provided any any 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.040
 special tools to open them there 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.130
 red like a thread know here and i 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.159

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.439
 she took but the plug is very comfortable and 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 general opening technique she is very 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.549
 important in this case because if you don’t 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 so open you can poke 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.400
 packaging and you never brew 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.080
 noodles 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.159
 and if you don't throw noodles you don't 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 having eaten mikus so opening technician 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.990

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.320
 opens to the left from the front 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.939
 side of the packaging we press weakly 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.009
 strongly because if strongly 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.799
 I as spoke there will be a hole and not 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.470

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.600
