00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.080
 2 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:22.090
 Wow- 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:26.660
 One of them is here is what you want to introduce a little Daiwa reel dropped from the side of me 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.560
 Hearing 3 mx model is out 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.390
 But most are in too there is a price range 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:41.120
 It becomes a reef that can cry for low 20,000 yen but 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:45.220
 The tv system will have a layer of the if t 3 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:51.790
 This wide T- shaped cat 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.780
 The line is blue and the distance is extended and it is easy to make free pole 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.180
 Or 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.860
 After the one-touch from theory cast mode all by by and a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.160
 Up to max brake 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 Function of Rutteyuu can switching than if t 3 is the rate also 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.850
 Like a rod d and a black label as an image usually 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.549
 me 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:23.250
 Minimize the decoration of parts not particularly related to the boots as much as possible 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:26.640
 It is part that does not compromise about functional point to plan Koss bullets- 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:32.430
 That material is good for you 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.800
 There is also the very lightly iterator using the strong and corrosion resistant material is Now the top-down 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.610
 Because we do not have the extra paint 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.840
 a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:44.310
 On the contrary, I can see that if I look at it well, but marbled 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.400
 I guess I Tteyuu Tsu yo plum I of a Zion 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.510
 I think this will be cool 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:58.240
 One good thing is that Miyagi can choose 3 types . 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:03.550
 In the past, it was an image of Hysia that was pretty much 6.3 to 1 but now it is 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:08.090
 A 6 white beige is getting more and more like a gear car but there is also a flow 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.349
 If even faster while there is a 6.3 in such 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.540
 h There is also a model called Super Fighting 8.1 even faster . 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.069
 According to my fishing 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.569
 What 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.130
 Yes, it has also become one of the features of Tteyuu choose the optimal gear care 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.870
 Hmm 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.140
 Another one I am personally the best 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:35.230
 A soon place that I believe that this year's highlights 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:39.050
 It is a school of fv school cat, but it is also just a spool here 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.010
 It is opposite but 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.490
 If you can only spool, for example, you have p 3 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 Or just replace the spool with steez 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.830
 It was also incorporated into the Well You know Mariru 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.640
 Also we'd spool release scheduled at the same time to its June 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.980
 Well great in will be the same as if Oh 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.080
 Most are and say or ask anything in a substantially it is indeed a reel of stress-free versatile 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.890
 Well just stress free 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.090
 I think it's best that there is no trouble use often You know the feeling 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.220
 In such a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.430
 Kedomo this s staff is I'm happy to me like a Okappari anglers I especially 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.540
 In one 5 reel 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.540
 All the fish you 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:42.740
 Booby Following Aichi tournament career , Patty heavy lure enter here 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:48.230
 I don't think it actually comes out 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:50.780
 In the past when the issue becomes in the area of lighter weight Grace 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.760
 like t 3 pairs 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:01.220
 Kedomo your gold-only beer I was becoming absolutely necessary 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.960
 As for the part, piece layer is already special 41 1 of Mido sinker rig 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:11.060
 It is the key slayer which is something to connect 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.650
 Cede to the tick key Slayer killing until there is respect but it is the ultimate just this s stake 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.910
 But there is 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.519
 It is US and China of the actual battle level Where to use the most specifically 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:26.030
 Or a gram back and forth When was it is squeezed 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:29.600
 A straight arm cat rig with a nail sinker of about 5 grams in it. 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:34.070
 Beit finesses up to 3 in the band with the most in that area 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.050
 It is body time from long throw with one cover 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.950
 Already 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.400
 It is good to say that you can handle it until you hit it 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.580
 sv was 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.070
 That I mean only of the story is very value-clothes 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.150
 I have it now 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:57.390
 Steve and t 3 will all change to this 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:01.200
 Nothing disadvantage without it or this base that 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:04.950
 T 3 even though I'm a meal also steez also was his 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.639
 Obviously the need for a single reel 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.840
 Yup 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.730
 It is this sv school to say that it is greatly up 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.730
 I hope everyone can try it 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.800
 2 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.800
