00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
the blast place I took it to they must

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.230 
the blast place I took it to they must
have<00:04:05.810> just<00:04:06.250> spun<00:04:07.250> around<00:04:07.400> by<00:04:07.580> hand<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.030> like

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
have just spun around by hand and like

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.820 
have just spun around by hand and like
it<00:04:08.420> wasn't<00:04:08.600> even<00:04:08.690> really<00:04:08.930> tight<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.530> didn't

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
it wasn't even really tight so it didn't

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.770 
it wasn't even really tight so it didn't
leak<00:04:09.980> so<00:04:10.600> should<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.690> all<00:04:11.810> right<00:04:13.330> wow<00:04:14.330> we're

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780
