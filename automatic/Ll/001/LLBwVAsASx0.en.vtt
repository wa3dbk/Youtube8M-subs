00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.369
 browser games 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.580
 5 years ago, if someone said that I 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.939
 dude and I found a cool shooter where 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.650
 I would ask him in the browser dude I would 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 indiscriminately spat in the face 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 because then I was different to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.450
 similar games before after falling from 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 third floor the world has changed a bit 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.770
 but now this is not the essence of the game 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
 the browser turned out to be nothing to me then 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 unimaginable the only genre that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.750
 supported those times was hack and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.940
 slash 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 drakensang is a good example 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 online 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.820
 and now, in principle, browser pants 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.940
 with advanced graphics and innovation 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.940
 don't go too far but there is an exception 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.739
 To confirm the game ballistic here 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.850
 here is the graph he's really cool and 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.850
 normal physics 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.400
 the toy came out in 2013 social 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.920
 facebook network 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.230
 past got to our vkontakte 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.120
 developed by people from famous 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.070
 studios and cripple yourself rumble 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.770
 entertaiment why they left 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.410
 I do not know how to develop games for social networks 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.470
 can kicked out or left 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.440
 but the fact that the game turned out is a fact even 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.680
 starting from the menu i praise the game like nothing 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.970
 special right your characters in the middle 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.550
 new items on the left 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.640
 game store stats and everything in it 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.430
 some cubes fly in the background 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.550
 but overall the menu style is beautifully decorated 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.310
 better than some chinese hits 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.830
 And I think enough to praise the menu 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.800
 very fight to choose from we have four 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.990
 each mode for himself control 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.700
 point where you need not to give the enemy 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.730
 certain places on the map 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.030
 the king of the hill is already holding only one 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.430
 point and the usual team game as well 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.270
 you can choose and on which card you will 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.150
 die here 8 each card is different 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.240
 then you fight the hands, under the dome 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.820
 or in a simple museum multi-level maps 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.330
 and there is room for tactical maneuvers and 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.820
 some more you can find traps here 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.430
 For example, a mental hospital on the street there 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.460
 certain containers going into them and 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.240
 I post there a little he closes let 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.910
 gas and you will meet your death battle goes 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.350
 by the way between two strong corporations 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.260
 red blue 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.020
 each has its own base in the game for which 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.810
 the enemy will not be able to come and you the 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.420
 time to fill up ammunition and health 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.880
 ammo is very small and if not thinking 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.700
 shoot will soon stay with a gun 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.520
 hands that can not be said about health 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.709
 standard here 180 hpn and nothing like 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.470
 special but in the initial stages of the game 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.959
 if you come close to the enemy and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.570
 cut the knife and that turn will 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.160
 shoot you you play you really with 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.160
 a shotgun such and not rolls 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.079
 and having played a couple of matches in ballistic themes 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.599
 by accumulating a small fortune you 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.319
 You can go to the store and buy a new one. 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.659
 weapon 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.760
 it is here divided into a few say 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.750
 ranks first standard 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.700
 will induce basic advanced elite and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.680
 the legendary difference of weapons at first and 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.470
 last rank not only in damage 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.650
 which is about twice as much but 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.930
 the presence of a large range but not all 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.629
 species are subject to your first class 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.099
 soldiers besides you exist also 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:53.019
 stormtroopers grenadiers arrows saboteurs 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.250
 machine gunners will give you dial them also need 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.079
 buy and each have their own weapon skins 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.090
 present and the ability to pump them 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.090
 need not for money but for special 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.939
 coupons mined in combat these skills 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.430
 passive no super strikes and flight and 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:11.799
 fast recharge ability 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.189
 pick up ammo and increase 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.189
 rate of fire 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:22.220
 and here we are on the sly 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.940
 when in the game you are able to buy everything 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.180
 for real 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.950
 legendary rank weapon classes to type 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.130
 armor for centuries to skins 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.100
 but you can do without it all buy 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.380
 without investing a penny really if you play 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.470
 Of course it's good there and the level is fast 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.370
 go up the money will flow in and 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.070
 ballroom gras are prized in class 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.980
 and more like the client they and that 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.080
 who prescribed a social network like her 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.000
