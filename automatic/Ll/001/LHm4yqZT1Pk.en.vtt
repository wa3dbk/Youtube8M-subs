in<00:00:59.750> Japanese<00:01:00.200> I<00:01:00.500> think<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.250> one<00:01:01.340> in<00:01:01.460> Stockton

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
in Japanese I think the one in Stockton

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.109 
in Japanese I think the one in Stockton
was<00:01:02.030> too<00:01:02.239> from<00:01:02.450> what<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.600> remember<00:01:02.890> but<00:01:03.890> uh<00:01:04.119> yeah

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
was too from what I remember but uh yeah

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.219 
was too from what I remember but uh yeah
see<00:01:05.329> it<00:01:05.420> shows<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.720> you<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.079> roll<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
see it shows you you have to roll the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.399 
see it shows you you have to roll the
trackball<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.859> stuff<00:01:07.039> like<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.359> so<00:01:08.359> you<00:01:09.289> go

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
trackball and stuff like that so you go

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:20.020 
trackball and stuff like that so you go
on<00:01:09.530> here<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:18.979> somehow<00:01:19.249> Robotnik<00:01:19.759> actually

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
on here and so somehow Robotnik actually

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.789 
on here and so somehow Robotnik actually
catches<00:01:20.329> sonic<00:01:20.719> which<00:01:20.840> should<00:01:21.229> never<00:01:21.350> fucking

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
catches sonic which should never fucking

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:22.989 
catches sonic which should never fucking
happen<00:01:22.100> ever<00:01:22.249> I<00:01:22.369> don't<00:01:22.429> understand<00:01:22.850> of<00:01:22.939> the

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
happen ever I don't understand of the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:28.179 
happen ever I don't understand of the
fuck<00:01:23.179> that<00:01:23.329> happens<00:01:26.619> and<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:27.829> have<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.069> go

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
fuck that happens and so you have to go

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.520 
fuck that happens and so you have to go
up<00:01:28.280> here<00:01:28.399> and<00:01:28.429> break<00:01:28.609> this<00:01:28.789> shit<00:01:29.380> which<00:01:30.380> you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
up here and break this shit which you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.599 
up here and break this shit which you
know<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.679> break<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.069> you<00:01:31.100> jump<00:01:31.340> through<00:01:31.369> and

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
know you break it you jump through and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.309 
know you break it you jump through and
then<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.759> run<00:01:31.909> in<00:01:32.029> here<00:01:32.209> then<00:01:32.899> you<00:01:33.170> basically

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
then you run in here then you basically

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:46.230 
then you run in here then you basically
run<00:01:33.649> around<00:01:33.829> like<00:01:33.920> you're<00:01:34.100> fucking<00:01:34.999> crazy

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.610 

and<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.480> blow<00:01:47.660> up<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.930> air<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:48.260> then

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
and so you blow up in the air and then

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.900 
and so you blow up in the air and then
you<00:01:48.740> land<00:01:48.950> on<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:49.190> island<00:01:49.430> where<00:01:49.730> presumably

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
you land on this island where presumably

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.700 
you land on this island where presumably
most<00:01:50.480> of<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.630> game<00:01:50.780> takes<00:01:50.990> place<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.590> as

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
most of the game takes place and so as

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
most of the game takes place and so as
you<00:01:57.800> can<00:01:57.890> see<00:01:58.040> there<00:01:58.160> on<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.310> bottom<00:01:58.430> left

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
you can see there on the bottom left

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.520 
you can see there on the bottom left
there's<00:01:58.940> actually<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.270> light<00:01:59.450> bar<00:01:59.660> and<00:01:59.900> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
there's actually a light bar and the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.740 
there's actually a light bar and the
Rings<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.040> game<00:02:01.250> aren't<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.730> like<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.570> mean

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
Rings in this game aren't a like I mean

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.420 
Rings in this game aren't a like I mean
like<00:02:03.260> if<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.500> get<00:02:03.620> hit<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:04.040> don't<00:02:04.250> actually

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
like if you get hit you don't actually

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.670 
like if you get hit you don't actually
lose<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.090> ring<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.690> speak<00:02:05.930> you<00:02:06.380> just<00:02:06.560> take

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
lose the ring so to speak you just take

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.910 
lose the ring so to speak you just take
damage<00:02:06.980> but<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:09.080> actually<00:02:09.260> supposed<00:02:09.740> to<00:02:09.770> get

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
damage but you actually supposed to get

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.910 
damage but you actually supposed to get
the<00:02:10.010> Rings<00:02:10.220> for<00:02:10.460> an<00:02:10.520> end<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.820> stage<00:02:11.060> bonus<00:02:11.920> you

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
the Rings for an end of stage bonus you

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.990 
the Rings for an end of stage bonus you
have<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.100> get<00:02:13.220> at<00:02:13.310> least<00:02:13.340> half<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.760> them<00:02:13.880> I

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
have to get at least half of them I

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.900 
have to get at least half of them I
believe<00:02:16.600> there<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.550> then<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.760> run

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
believe there you go and so then you run

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.650 
believe there you go and so then you run
on<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.280> jump<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.610> little<00:02:23.120> sling<00:02:23.540> around

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
on this and jump a little sling around

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.310 
on this and jump a little sling around
you<00:02:23.930> jump<00:02:24.170> come<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.100> fire<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.340> jump

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
you jump come on do that fire you jump

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.710 
you jump come on do that fire you jump
so<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.380> know<00:02:27.620> it's<00:02:27.980> pretty<00:02:28.160> basic<00:02:28.510> sonic<00:02:29.510> that

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
so you know it's pretty basic sonic that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240 
so you know it's pretty basic sonic that
the<00:02:29.900> character<00:02:30.260> design<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.680> sonic<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.160> this

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the character design for sonic and this

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.680 
the character design for sonic and this
is<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> little<00:02:31.610> bit<00:02:31.790> different<00:02:32.240> than<00:02:32.450> usual

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
is a little bit different than usual

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.860 
is a little bit different than usual
actually<00:02:34.120> they<00:02:35.120> drew<00:02:35.330> them<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.540> little<00:02:35.660> bit

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
actually they drew them a little bit

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.280 
actually they drew them a little bit
shorter<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.860> stockier<00:02:37.430> than<00:02:37.760> usual<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.300> think

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.930 

also<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> can't<00:02:46.920> remember<00:02:47.310> if<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.580> came<00:02:47.819> out

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
also I can't remember if this came out

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.600 
also I can't remember if this came out
first<00:02:48.120> or<00:02:48.360> Sonic<00:02:48.810> CD<00:02:49.019> came<00:02:49.349> out<00:02:49.500> first<00:02:49.709> but

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
first or Sonic CD came out first but

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
first or Sonic CD came out first but
this<00:02:51.030> might<00:02:51.239> be<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> first<00:02:51.659> time<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.870> sonic

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
this might be the first time the sonic

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.780 
this might be the first time the sonic
actually<00:02:52.590> speaks<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.069> game<00:02:53.250> because<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
actually speaks in the game because I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.580 
actually speaks in the game because I
know<00:02:53.849> sonic<00:02:54.269> CD<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.959> was<00:02:55.110> either<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.440> or

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
know sonic CD it was either this or

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.610 
know sonic CD it was either this or
sonic<00:02:55.920> CD<00:02:59.060> volcanic<00:03:00.060> ball<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:01.110> yeah<00:03:01.349> only<00:03:01.470> got

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
sonic CD volcanic ball and yeah only got

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.210 
sonic CD volcanic ball and yeah only got
ten<00:03:01.799> rings<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.129> basically<00:03:02.310> sucked<00:03:02.700> ass<00:03:07.069> so<00:03:08.069> then

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
ten rings I basically sucked ass so then

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.020 
ten rings I basically sucked ass so then
there's<00:03:08.370> seven<00:03:08.640> levels<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.879> this<00:03:08.940> game

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030

let out here about to get nailed by the
crackling<00:03:53.530> ground<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:58.150> then<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.329> have<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.510> go

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
crackling ground and then you have to go

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.880 
crackling ground and then you have to go
on<00:03:58.689> these<00:03:58.810> things<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.170> these<00:03:59.260> are<00:03:59.439> actually

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
on these things and these are actually

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.890 
on these things and these are actually
aren't<00:04:00.310> these<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.609> sonic<00:04:00.970> adventure<00:04:01.420> that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
aren't these in sonic adventure that

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.050 
aren't these in sonic adventure that
like<00:04:02.049> exact<00:04:02.530> design<00:04:02.739> so<00:04:03.609> I<00:04:03.639> wonder<00:04:03.849> if<00:04:03.940> that's

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
like exact design so I wonder if that's

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.160 
like exact design so I wonder if that's
where<00:04:04.209> this<00:04:04.299> is<00:04:04.359> from<00:04:04.480> because<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:04.959> mean<00:04:05.109> that's

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
where this is from because I mean that's

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.509 
where this is from because I mean that's
that<00:04:05.530> looks<00:04:05.680> like<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.889> exact<00:04:06.190> design<00:04:06.340> of

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
that looks like the exact design of

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.190 
that looks like the exact design of
those<00:04:06.639> things<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.060> climb<00:04:07.659> on<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.959> Sonic

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
those things you a climb on in Sonic

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.819 
those things you a climb on in Sonic

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
know what that was on purpose or not

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.009
