after that the left side cancer cell is

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.640 
after that the left side cancer cell is
also<00:07:44.280> killed<00:07:44.639> and<00:07:44.910> then<00:07:45.360> the<00:07:45.389> NK<00:07:45.870> cell<00:07:46.169> starts

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
also killed and then the NK cell starts

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.089 
also killed and then the NK cell starts
attacking<00:07:47.160> others<00:07:47.520> in<00:07:48.150> this<00:07:48.449> way<00:07:48.660> an<00:07:48.990> NK<00:07:49.740> cell

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 
relation between NK cells and cancer is

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.379 
relation between NK cells and cancer is
just<00:07:58.889> like<00:07:59.039> a<00:07:59.070> war<00:07:59.400> game<00:07:59.610> between<00:07:59.880> cat<00:08:00.360> and

cancer cells off hand on the contrary
cancer<00:08:06.720> cells<00:08:06.960> could<00:08:07.199> attack<00:08:07.560> NK<00:08:08.130> cells<00:08:08.430> when

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 
cancer cells could attack NK cells when

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:11.900 
cancer cells could attack NK cells when
NK<00:08:09.150> cells<00:08:09.419> are<00:08:09.599> weaker<00:08:09.930> I<00:08:10.169> call<00:08:11.099> it<00:08:11.250> a<00:08:11.370> cell<00:08:11.610> war
