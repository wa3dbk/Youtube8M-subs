00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.970 
like a 10 mil sort of barrel shape
different<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> round<00:00:30.480> one<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.470> think<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
different from a round one and I think a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.830 
different from a round one and I think a
little<00:00:32.219> bit<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.489> readily<00:00:32.940> taken<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.719> we

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
little bit more readily taken and if we

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660 
little bit more readily taken and if we
just<00:00:33.870> show<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.370> end<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
just show you this one on the end of the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.340 
just show you this one on the end of the
rig<00:00:35.850> there<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> slow<00:00:36.660> sinker<00:00:37.230> so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
rig there that's a slow sinker so

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.560 
rig there that's a slow sinker so
there's<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.620> bit<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> pop<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.219> mix<00:00:38.570> with

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
there's a little bit of pop up mix with

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.630 
there's a little bit of pop up mix with
a<00:00:39.600> normal<00:00:40.110> boiling<00:00:40.320> mix<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.040> pineapple

sit<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> bottom<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> bait

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
sit like that on the bottom so the bait

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.360 
sit like that on the bottom so the bait
is<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.480> hovering<00:00:45.809> above<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.860> over<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> top

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.889 
is just hovering above and over the top
of<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> spot<00:00:47.789> makes<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.390> bright<00:00:48.629> hook

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
of a spot makes a little bright hook

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.959 
of a spot makes a little bright hook
bait<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.739> often<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.100> picked<00:00:50.789> out

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
bait like that can often be picked out

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.100 
bait like that can often be picked out
first<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:52.530> next<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.920> down<00:00:53.239> we've<00:00:54.239> got<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.719> bit

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
first the next one down we've got a bit

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.700 
first the next one down we've got a bit
of<00:00:55.199> floating<00:00:56.129> pop-up<00:00:57.059> column<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> then

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
of floating pop-up column there and then

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
of floating pop-up column there and then
we've<00:00:58.949> also<00:00:59.039> got<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> 10<00:00:59.850> mil<00:01:00.059> sail<00:01:00.329> boilie<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
we've also got a 10 mil sail boilie and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
we've also got a 10 mil sail boilie and
again<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> sit<00:01:01.980> literally<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
again that's going to sit literally the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.579 
again that's going to sit literally the
weight<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.359> boilie<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
weight of that boilie is just going to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
weight of that boilie is just going to
allow<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.339> hover<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
allow it to just hover like that so it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.660 
allow it to just hover like that so it
goes<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> fish's<00:01:07.860> mouth<00:01:07.890> very<00:01:08.340> easily

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
goes into the fish's mouth very easily

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
goes into the fish's mouth very easily
we've<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.540> two<00:01:09.750> different<00:01:10.110> types<00:01:10.290> of

pop up so if I can fish a bottom bait I
will<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:24.960> unfortunately<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.340> front<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.700> me

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
everyone's going to fish on that so I've

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
everyone's going to fish on that so I've
gone<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.600> beyond<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.110> whether<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.890> a

they led still feeling down nice and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.719 
they led still feeling down nice and
hard<00:01:39.450> I've<00:01:40.170> got<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> PVA<00:01:40.799> stick<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.400> well<00:01:41.579> to

stop the hook getting caught in anything
in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> bottom<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.280> I'll<00:01:45.060> fish<00:01:45.540> those<00:01:45.750> over

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
in the bottom and I'll fish those over

the bottom so that's the real I would
use<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.349> situation

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
over the top of it and I've just made

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.810 
over the top of it and I've just made
those<00:02:27.290> with<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.620> Polaris<00:02:28.010> pop<00:02:28.160> up<00:02:28.340> mix<00:02:28.580> and

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
those with the Polaris pop up mix and

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.150 
those with the Polaris pop up mix and
I've<00:02:29.150> literally<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:29.810> squeezed<00:02:30.200> them<00:02:30.560> like

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
I've literally just squeezed them like

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.940 
I've literally just squeezed them like
that<00:02:31.370> into<00:02:32.210> an<00:02:32.330> odd<00:02:32.450> shape<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.560> they<00:02:33.680> looked

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
that into an odd shape so they looked

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.790 
that into an odd shape so they looked
like<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.220> chops<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:35.420> my<00:02:35.720> own<00:02:35.900> spod<00:02:36.260> mix<00:02:36.530> so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
like the chops in my own spod mix so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.080 
like the chops in my own spod mix so
that's<00:02:37.280> going<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.520> be<00:02:37.610> very<00:02:37.730> hard<00:02:38.030> to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
that's going to be very hard to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.550 
that's going to be very hard to
differentiate<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> fishes<00:02:39.260> point<00:02:39.470> of

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
differentiate from the fishes point of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.440 
differentiate from the fishes point of
view<00:02:39.710> between<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.460> free<00:02:40.700> offering<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.270> one<00:02:41.360> of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
view between a free offering and one of

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.150 
view between a free offering and one of
those<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.750> again<00:02:41.810> that's<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.710> sit<00:02:42.920> very

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
those and again that's going to sit very

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.650 
those and again that's going to sit very
very<00:02:43.370> low<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.820> bottom<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.270> it's<00:02:44.390> not<00:02:44.480> too

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
very low to the bottom so it's not too

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.870 
very low to the bottom so it's not too
startling<00:02:45.200> for<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.440> fish<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.920> I'd<00:02:46.370> fish<00:02:46.610> that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
startling for the fish and I'd fish that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.820 
startling for the fish and I'd fish that
over<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.510> little<00:02:47.690> bit<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.990> bottom<00:02:48.170> weed<00:02:48.560> and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
over a little bit of bottom weed and

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.710 
over a little bit of bottom weed and
then<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.460> last<00:02:49.670> one<00:02:49.970> if<00:02:50.150> it's<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.360> little<00:02:50.600> bit

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
then the last one if it's a little bit

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.140 
then the last one if it's a little bit
clearer<00:02:51.050> this<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.160> KD<00:02:52.610> rig<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.090> I've

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
clearer this is the KD rig so I've

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.610 
clearer this is the KD rig so I've
changed<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.630> pattern<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.990> hook<00:02:54.170> from<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.470> wide

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
changed the pattern of hook from a wide

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.040 
changed the pattern of hook from a wide
gate<00:02:54.890> B<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> curve<00:02:55.940> B<00:02:56.240> that's<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.600> size<00:02:56.780> I

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
gate B to a curve B that's the size I

gate B to a curve B that's the size I
slightly<00:02:58.040> longer<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.730> can<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:58.880> see

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
slightly longer here and can you see

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.150 
slightly longer here and can you see
there<00:02:59.450> I've<00:02:59.630> got<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.350> hair<00:03:00.530> coming<00:03:00.920> off<00:03:01.010> the

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
there I've got the hair coming off the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.250 
there I've got the hair coming off the
back<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> knotless<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.270> all<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.020> others

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
back of the knotless not all the others

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.230 
back of the knotless not all the others
have<00:03:03.380> got<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> ring<00:03:03.800> attached<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.460> hook<00:03:04.610> so

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
have got a ring attached to the hook so

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.820 
have got a ring attached to the hook so
that<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.780> hair<00:03:06.080> comes<00:03:06.320> off<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.590> hook<00:03:06.740> a

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
that the hair comes off the hook a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.860 
that the hair comes off the hook a
little<00:03:06.860> bit<00:03:07.160> further<00:03:07.370> down<00:03:07.520> this<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.630> works

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
little bit further down this one works

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.750 
little bit further down this one works
completely<00:03:09.380> differently<00:03:09.800> you're<00:03:10.310> making<00:03:10.640> the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
completely differently you're making the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.790 
completely differently you're making the
eye<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.270> hook<00:03:11.420> light<00:03:11.720> which<00:03:12.380> in<00:03:12.560> turn

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
eye of the hook light which in turn

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.830 
eye of the hook light which in turn
makes<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.250> point<00:03:13.460> of<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> hook<00:03:13.880> heavy<00:03:14.180> and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
makes the point of the hook heavy and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.540 
makes the point of the hook heavy and
that's<00:03:14.990> when<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.380> goes<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.800> that's<00:03:16.310> going<00:03:16.430> to

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
that's when it goes in that's going to

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.550 
that's when it goes in that's going to
catch<00:03:16.730> hold<00:03:17.030> really<00:03:17.600> aggressively<00:03:18.230> and

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
catch hold really aggressively and

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.320 
catch hold really aggressively and
hopefully<00:03:19.130> gets<00:03:19.310> lots<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.640> bites<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.090> one<00:03:20.300> I

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
hopefully gets lots of bites that one I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.580 
hopefully gets lots of bites that one I
wouldn't<00:03:20.600> fish<00:03:20.810> if<00:03:20.930> there's<00:03:21.110> heavy<00:03:21.320> weed

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
wouldn't fish if there's heavy weed

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.470 
wouldn't fish if there's heavy weed
because<00:03:22.250> you<00:03:22.370> can<00:03:22.520> see<00:03:22.700> as<00:03:22.910> you're<00:03:23.090> pulling

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
because you can see as you're pulling

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.480 
because you can see as you're pulling
that<00:03:23.510> up<00:03:23.750> off<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.080> bottom<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.980> hook<00:03:25.160> sort<00:03:25.430> of

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
that up off the bottom the hook sort of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.860 
that up off the bottom the hook sort of
hanging<00:03:25.700> down<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.300> can<00:03:26.450> get<00:03:26.600> caught<00:03:26.840> in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
hanging down and it can get caught in

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.440 
hanging down and it can get caught in
the<00:03:27.080> weed<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.280> weedy<00:03:28.550> just<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.270> show

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
the weed so if it's weedy just to show

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.420 
the weed so if it's weedy just to show
that<00:03:29.600> one<00:03:29.780> before<00:03:30.200> I've<00:03:30.830> got<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.250> way

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
that one before I've got it that way

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.910 
that one before I've got it that way
round<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.600> the<00:03:33.020> hook<00:03:33.170> goes<00:03:33.350> into<00:03:33.620> their<00:03:33.770> mouth

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
round so the hook goes into their mouth

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.830 
round so the hook goes into their mouth
a<00:03:33.950> little<00:03:34.160> bit<00:03:34.280> easier<00:03:34.760> if<00:03:35.000> it's<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.630> we<00:03:35.780> D

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
a little bit easier if it's not so we D

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.920 
a little bit easier if it's not so we D
