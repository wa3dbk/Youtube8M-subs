 for that they do not know we are 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 went to ulta it's rare I think about 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 prefect store volodia really all 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.630

 who are all united under the same 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.030
 roof so this is it's a killing 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 store first let's start with the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 products for the complexion I gave him 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.270
 recommended a cream bb from garnier 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.550
 because for me it's the creamy bb 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 the surpasses who is who have the best 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.480
 result I used for months 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.680
 and for months the cream garnier and the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.070
 girlfriend she has mixed skin like me 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.559
 so 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 she tried she does not shine and she 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.250
 covers to these guys there a good 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.990
 competition is she a spf 15 so 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.400
 really well polluted bcra if you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.439
 start in make-up and you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 not too sure what to you direct the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.939
 bb cream is really a safe bet 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.990
 and that of garnier are really 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.759
 are the best lovers next to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.090
 stay in the tone I advised him 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.549
 the corrector of at revlon so the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.470
 fault would have said so I had bought 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.600
 month in thailand and i loved it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.340
 in fact it comes in the form of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 sticks so very practical to apply 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.270
 directly in front of you and then to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.250
 made to penetrate and he is really very 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.220
 moisturizing so it's not going to spin in the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.560
 thought folds eyes of the kind it is 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.880
 really it reaches and it will go well 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.530
 cover up your dark circles 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.149
 so he has good coverage also 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.280
 so really if you are looking for a 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.140
 corrector super me is the corrector 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
 large areas that I create a lot 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.159
 of dreams and where once again from home 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.490
 revlon so left the kohler powder 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.340
 cited 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.340
 and so here is the more what 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.890
 have not heard fix your complexion a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.410
 beam is really essential we do not 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.330
 just do not put that would put megan and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.030
 not at best powder and especially when he 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.860
 is hot for not that makeup 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.430
 reels all day long not to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.320
 to shine 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.720
 so here I advise you no 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.490
 I pray them that of those at home 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.870
 revlon game the counselors after there are in 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.090
 has others who are just as good I 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.720
 believe the rimmel I heard good 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.090
 the maybelline 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.800
 I do not like it too much but the pencil for 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.760
 eyebrows of the mark and so sambre the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.170
 brand and its rise in France you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 can find it in canaries me 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.650
 so it looks like it's an eyebrow pencil 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.260
 all simple black because she has the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.280
 black eyebrows and I took 1 that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.780
 had the little zigzag to style the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.710
 worries between them too they have to 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.330
 have a good shape 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.970
 so here's a simple pencil after 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.580
 any brand that customer's going 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.380
 to register I want to tell you by 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.270
 mascara I advised him h the ace 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.430
 volume of chico burger so I had it 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.190
 already me and I find super top actually 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.630
 the brush and completely picot and that 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.640
 so did not find it in France 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.730
 as I wanted to say there are 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.500
 rockets from maybelline who 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 are great always if you start a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.800
 makeup you do not necessarily have the 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.239
 techniques to make a gradient on the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.290
 eyes with several eyeshadow 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.060
 finally smoky etc 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.800
 so I advised him the colors 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.380
 maybelline tattoo you know that 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.850
 I put it adore so she took the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.400
 hue father ibrahim is so that to 70 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.900
 which is a pretty simple beige color 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.190
 who will go with everything really 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.330
 to unify the mobile eyelid and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.550
 then put a little liner 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.220
 or just mascara it's really very 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.750
 very natural and with that we can not 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.040
 too drunk for the evenings for the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.569
 time we really want more 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.069
 work on her makeup that's where 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.780
 broken down is not essential but 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.670
 good I still had some 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.379
 a few sous in his budget so we 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.019
 thought why not so she exclaims 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.129
 a palette mix so the x is a 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.540
 mark that you basically find 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.060
 in the united states but you can also the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.219
 find on the internet in my opinion so 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.579
 she took a pallet of neutral with 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:02.500
 just a little plum for for his 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.549
 makeups so you have a black I 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.900
 told him to have then because 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.299
 it was really essential in a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.239
 makeup and a pleasing to do too 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.430
 highlight it under there eyebrow 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.040
 so this is a very neutral pallet 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.039
 nice no it's there I do not know what 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.380
 it's called I do not know what then a 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.020
 customer is the nyse 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.080
 so this is a basic collar one she has 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.039
 apparently took this one so he does not 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.810
 would not be too much in France 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.060
 in France I advise you if you 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.220
 start in the cage the collar of home 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.570
 bourjois 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.280
 this is the proof colonizer from 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.110
 bourjois it is top i have during 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.940
 years until I turn to 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.259
 that of the man indicated that still 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.400
 better in my opinion but here you are 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.599
 just start a makeup the 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.820
 bourgeois makes quite the sphere where 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.740
 this one it is also very very pigments 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.590
 brushes because she had 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.720
 absolutely empty of having brushes if 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.509
 you never really start 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.849
 essential to have brushes so there 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.710
 had the brushes and co toulouse at 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.229
 ulta so it's the brushes that I have 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.639
 also could test I had bought me 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.289
 I ordered from the internet on the 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.490
 site to the error ok she had taken a 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.050
 little kit like that they were costing 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.970
 really really cheap with 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.639
 the essentials for the complexion to apply 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.199
 his bluff and his powder and then for 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.449
 the eyes a few small English from 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.820
 nyx so that I did not know but 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.169
 I absolutely had to test it and 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.880
 anyway I had only heard of 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.550
 good Christmas is chilly pink steve 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.590
 is actually a blush that was going 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.430
 well with his complexion because we have 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.770
 wanted to take something pretty 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.080
 discreet anyway and it's a wood of 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.550

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.150
