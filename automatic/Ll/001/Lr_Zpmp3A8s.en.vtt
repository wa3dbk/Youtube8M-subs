00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.900
 knowing that the victory then he wants 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.900
 know about that amount of dex that 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 or 6 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.920
 depends also on the resolution is that you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.910
