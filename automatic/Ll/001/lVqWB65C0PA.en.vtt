pure water and traditional winter team
you<00:00:10.349> might<00:00:10.530> think<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.010> doesn't<00:00:11.219> make<00:00:11.400> any

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
you might think it doesn't make any

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
you might think it doesn't make any
difference<00:00:11.849> whatsoever<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.170> found<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.679> I

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
difference whatsoever but I found that I

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.279 
difference whatsoever but I found that I
think<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.460> does<00:00:14.490> actually<00:00:15.080> especially<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
think it does actually especially if you

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.790 
think it does actually especially if you
live<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.550> hard<00:00:18.000> water<00:00:18.300> area<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.560> always

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
live in a hard water area you can always

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.710 
live in a hard water area you can always
harvest<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.760> bit<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.000> rainwater<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.630> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
harvest a bit of rainwater if you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
harvest a bit of rainwater if you
haven't<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> gear<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.789> it's<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
haven't got the gear that it's but I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.839 
haven't got the gear that it's but I
think<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.420> really<00:00:24.570> worthwhile<00:00:25.490> if<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:26.730> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
think it's really worthwhile if all you

think it's really worthwhile if all you
do<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:27.990> some<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> these<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.740> litre<00:00:29.189> pull

will be clean it won't leave as many
streaks<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.430> then<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:49.250> use<00:00:50.250> very

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
streaks and then if you can use very

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.600 
streaks and then if you can use very
thin<00:00:52.190> applicators<00:00:53.190> pads<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:55.440> your<00:00:55.610> equipment

only<00:00:57.030> squeegee<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.750> usually<00:00:58.289> use<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> right

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
only squeegee I usually use the right

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.889 
only squeegee I usually use the right
tool<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> very<00:01:00.329> very

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
tool as you know and that's a very very

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.799 
tool as you know and that's a very very
thin<00:01:01.199> pad<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.940> picks<00:01:03.180> dirt<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.660> off

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
thin pad so I know it picks dirt up off

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.119 
thin pad so I know it picks dirt up off
the<00:01:03.930> glass<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.589> what's<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.830> can't

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the glass you think what's this can't

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
the glass you think what's this can't
terminate<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:07.229> going

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
terminate it then that's it it's going

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.810 
terminate it then that's it it's going
to<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.530> contaminated<00:01:07.860> that's<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> waste

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to be contaminated that's just a waste

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.109 
to be contaminated that's just a waste
of<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.170> pad<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.680> very<00:01:10.860> thin

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
of time but because the pad is very thin

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
of time but because the pad is very thin
you're<00:01:12.360> always<00:01:12.479> washing<00:01:13.020> through<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.920> this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you're always washing through with this

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
you're always washing through with this
bottle<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.330> pure<00:01:15.570> water<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
bottle here with pure water on a bit of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.340 
bottle here with pure water on a bit of
wash<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> good<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.540> stays<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
wash not the good in and it stays at a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.219 
wash not the good in and it stays at a
pretty<00:01:19.890> constant<00:01:20.280> level<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.000> TDs<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.990> pad

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
pretty constant level of TDs in your pad

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.289 
pretty constant level of TDs in your pad
and<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:23.220> long<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.430> your<00:01:23.670> windows<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.000> pretty

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and as long as your windows are pretty

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
and as long as your windows are pretty
you<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:24.990> reasonably<00:01:25.439> clean<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:25.920> doing

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you know reasonably clean you're doing

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580 
you know reasonably clean you're doing
them<00:01:26.430> maintenance<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.810> me<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.290> think

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
them maintenance things like me I think

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
them maintenance things like me I think
it<00:01:28.829> will<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.159> difference<00:01:29.670> especially<00:01:29.790> as

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
it will make a difference especially as

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.609 
it will make a difference especially as
I<00:01:30.720> say<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:30.990> there

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
I say in there

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.030 
I say in there
a<00:01:31.650> hard<00:01:32.340> water<00:01:32.549> area<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.720> you'll<00:01:34.619> need<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> put

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
a hard water area so you'll need to put

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
a hard water area so you'll need to put
the<00:01:35.130> bottle<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.700> belt<00:01:36.240> somewhere<00:01:36.780> get

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the bottle on you belt somewhere get

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.550 
the bottle on you belt somewhere get
that<00:01:37.470> sorted<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.240> thin<00:01:39.240> strip<00:01:39.540> washer<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that sorted out thin strip washer you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.960 
that sorted out thin strip washer you
can<00:01:40.710> give<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.040> try<00:01:41.280> anyway<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.820> how<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
can give it a try anyway and see how you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.730 
can give it a try anyway and see how you
get<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.450> but<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.560> worthwhile

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
get on but then I think it's worthwhile

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
get on but then I think it's worthwhile
and<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.820> pure<00:01:45.030> water<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and it's pure water in here and a bit of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980 
and it's pure water in here and a bit of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
washing-up liquid eat cover and that's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
washing-up liquid eat cover and that's
ready<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.350> tomorrow<00:01:49.649> I've<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.100> several<00:01:50.340> of

ready for tomorrow I've got several of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.030 
ready for tomorrow I've got several of
