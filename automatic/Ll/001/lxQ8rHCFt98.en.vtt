an injury go and double dose of giants
there<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.780> think<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:48.930> face<00:01:49.259> mask<00:01:49.590> maybe

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
there I think it's just face mask maybe

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
there I think it's just face mask maybe
that's<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.369> problem<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.090> agree<00:01:51.509> okay

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that's the problem there I agree okay
