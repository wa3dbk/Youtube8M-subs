going on our nails and I'm not sticking
metal<00:00:39.570> through<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> am<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.590> using<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
metal through it I am just using the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000 
metal through it I am just using the
sculpey<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:42.320> mixing<00:00:43.320> primo<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:43.829> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
sculpey and not mixing primo with it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.330 
sculpey and not mixing primo with it
this<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> sculpey<00:00:45.420> white<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
this is the sculpey white this is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.720 
this is the sculpey white this is
sculpey<00:00:48.090> Rhino<00:00:48.360> grey<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.460> then<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
sculpey Rhino grey and then this is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.010 
sculpey Rhino grey and then this is
burnt<00:00:51.390> umber<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:52.260> primo<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.719> two

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
burnt umber from primo so you have two

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
burnt umber from primo so you have two
ways<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> roll<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> flat<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.550> roll<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
ways to roll it flat you can roll it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.959 
ways to roll it flat you can roll it
flat<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> pasta<00:00:58.260> roller<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:59.699> doing

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
flat with a pasta roller I like doing

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
flat with a pasta roller I like doing
that<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:00.899> all<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> them

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that because then you know all of them

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
that because then you know all of them
are<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> same<00:01:02.190> thickness<00:01:03.559> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
are going to be the same thickness the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.399 
are going to be the same thickness the
three<00:01:04.860> ice<00:01:05.040> cream<00:01:05.450> colors<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.720> actually

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
three ice cream colors are actually

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.840 
three ice cream colors are actually
rolled<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.220> number<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.850> thickness<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
rolled on a number one thickness and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.620 
rolled on a number one thickness and
then<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:13.100> what<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.060> roll<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
then here what you can do to roll it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.530 
then here what you can do to roll it
flat<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> roller<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.540> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
can use a tool to roll it flat it could

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
can use a tool to roll it flat it could
be<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> pin<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.250> could<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> clay<00:01:23.820> roller<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
be a pin it could be a clay roller it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.590 
be a pin it could be a clay roller it
could<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> clay<00:01:25.049> tool<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.530> i<00:01:25.710> am<00:01:25.830> using<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
could be a clay tool like i am using and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.870 
could be a clay tool like i am using and
you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.840> roll<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> flat<00:01:28.380> like<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.250> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
you can roll it flat like this it just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
you can roll it flat like this it just
won't<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.630> completely<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.350> hundred<00:01:31.680> percent

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
won't be completely a hundred percent

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.569 
won't be completely a hundred percent
even<00:01:33.409> but<00:01:34.409> you'll<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> do<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.369> two

even but you'll want to do it like two
millimeters<00:01:36.119> thick<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> basically

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
millimeters thick for that so basically

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
millimeters thick for that so basically
what<00:01:39.150> i<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.689> i<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:40.590> pink<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.460> side

the other chocolate clay and I like

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.229 
the other chocolate clay and I like
doing<00:03:05.569> it<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.019> way<00:03:06.459> because<00:03:07.459> you<00:03:07.819> can<00:03:08.000> make

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
doing it this way because you can make

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.830 
doing it this way because you can make
more<00:03:08.600> than<00:03:08.630> one<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:10.510> said<00:03:11.510> it's<00:03:11.660> like<00:03:11.810> a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
more than one I said it's like a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.520 
more than one I said it's like a
miniature<00:03:12.430> cane<00:03:16.510> so<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:19.600> took<00:03:20.600> a<00:03:20.660> slice<00:03:20.959> off<00:03:21.200> so

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
miniature cane so I took a slice off so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.440 
miniature cane so I took a slice off so
this<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.709> what<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.069> looks<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.790> from<00:03:26.060> here

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
this is what it looks like so from here

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.020 
this is what it looks like so from here
I'm<00:03:27.410> going<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:27.920> pretty<00:03:28.310> thin<00:03:28.670> slice

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
I'm going to do a pretty thin slice

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.610 
I'm going to do a pretty thin slice
because<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.540> don't<00:03:29.690> want<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.049> stand<00:03:30.260> up<00:03:30.500> on

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
because you don't want it to stand up on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.520 
because you don't want it to stand up on
your<00:03:30.680> nail<00:03:31.069> too<00:03:31.430> much<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.870> there's<00:03:33.079> a<00:03:33.170> slice

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
your nail too much so there's a slice

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.160 
your nail too much so there's a slice
and<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.549> way<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:34.940> actually<00:03:35.180> texture<00:03:36.049> it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
and the way that I actually texture it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.110 
and the way that I actually texture it
and<00:03:36.470> in<00:03:37.389> in<00:03:38.389> real<00:03:38.930> life<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:39.440> can<00:03:39.709> see<00:03:40.120> that

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
and in in real life you can see that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.110 
and in in real life you can see that
it's<00:03:41.299> textured<00:03:42.639> here<00:03:43.639> it<00:03:43.790> looks<00:03:43.970> pretty

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
it's textured here it looks pretty

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.289 
it's textured here it looks pretty
glossy<00:03:44.769> but<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:46.130> texture<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:47.060> a

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
glossy but I texture it with a

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.059 
glossy but I texture it with a
toothbrush

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.199 

and<00:03:53.700> then<00:03:53.909> you<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.299> make<00:03:54.540> sure<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:55.819> if<00:03:56.819> when

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
and then you just make sure that if when

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.580 
and then you just make sure that if when
you're<00:03:57.299> texturing<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:57.959> with<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.079> toothbrush

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
you're texturing it with a toothbrush

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.619 
you're texturing it with a toothbrush
and<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.889> starts<00:03:59.249> bulging<00:03:59.760> out<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.060> sides<00:04:00.299> you

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
and it starts bulging out the sides you

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.729 
and it starts bulging out the sides you
could<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:00.900> come<00:04:01.200> back<00:04:01.349> with<00:04:01.530> your

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
could just come back with your

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.780 
could just come back with your
fingernail<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.219> clean<00:04:02.639> it<00:04:02.790> up<00:04:04.430> sorry<00:04:05.430> there

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790

strawberry colored play and that's the

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.360 
strawberry colored play and that's the
main<00:05:42.719> differences<00:05:43.289> from<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.710> tutorials

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
everything else is pretty much the same

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.700 
everything else is pretty much the same

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
although if you want to make a big one

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.040 
although if you want to make a big one
and<00:05:50.389> I<00:05:51.389> haven't<00:05:51.690> made<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.940> tutorial<00:05:54.509> yet<00:05:54.719> for

and I haven't made the tutorial yet for

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.189

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
it when you grow up grind it with a

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.600 
it when you grow up grind it with a
nutmeg<00:05:58.680> reiner<00:05:59.810> do<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:00.990> lengthwise<00:06:01.740> rather

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
nutmeg reiner do it lengthwise rather

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.060

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
than sideways so you get slightly bigger

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.200 
than sideways so you get slightly bigger
chunks

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
chunks

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.909
