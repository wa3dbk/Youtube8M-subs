so<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> cut<00:01:22.500> down<00:01:22.650> trees<00:01:22.979> for

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so we don't have to cut down trees for

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.289 
so we don't have to cut down trees for
wood<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.640> paper<00:01:23.880> there's<00:01:24.630> hemp<00:01:24.930> plastics<00:01:25.619> that

they talk about it's like let's say you
have<00:01:44.040> two<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:45.000> input<00:01:45.210> well<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.530> corn

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
have two in one input well you with corn

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
have two in one input well you with corn
based<00:01:47.100> ethanol<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.700> might<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.210> two<00:01:48.479> input

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
