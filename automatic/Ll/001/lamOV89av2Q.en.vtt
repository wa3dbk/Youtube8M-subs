now the standard color will always be
red<00:00:58.900> so<00:00:59.080> let<00:00:59.199> me<00:00:59.290> plop<00:00:59.559> down<00:00:59.710> another<00:00:59.949> one<00:01:00.040> and

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
red so let me plop down another one and

red so let me plop down another one and
we<00:01:01.030> do<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.540> takes<00:01:01.780> maybe<00:01:02.199> 2<00:01:02.589> seconds<00:01:02.979> or

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
so before it appears but there it is you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.490 
so before it appears but there it is you
can<00:01:07.240> see<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:07.540> needs<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.840> load<00:01:08.020> in<00:01:08.170> or<00:01:08.290> something

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
can see it needs to load in or something

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.460 
can see it needs to load in or something
and<00:01:09.010> it<00:01:09.670> is<00:01:09.820> pretty<00:01:10.180> cool<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.780> really<00:01:11.140> liked<00:01:11.320> the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
color nice shadows on there as well and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.819 
color nice shadows on there as well and
you<00:01:50.079> can<00:01:50.229> simply<00:01:50.770> get<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.460> there<00:01:51.719> like<00:01:52.719> that

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you can simply get in there like that

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.160 
you can simply get in there like that
but<00:01:53.829> it<00:01:54.069> doesn't<00:01:54.399> really<00:01:54.759> move<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.509> lot<00:01:55.719> yet<00:01:56.020> you

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
but it doesn't really move a lot yet you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.459 
but it doesn't really move a lot yet you
can't<00:01:56.469> do<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.950> much<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.390> is<00:01:58.600> because

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
can't do that much and that is because

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.289 
can't do that much and that is because
it<00:01:59.590> will<00:01:59.740> take<00:02:00.009> coal<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:01.210> will

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
it will take coal and it will

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.580 
it will take coal and it will
automatically<00:02:01.899> take<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.319> from<00:02:02.469> your

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
automatically take it from your

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.559 
automatically take it from your
inventory<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.280> will<00:02:03.399> either<00:02:03.520> take<00:02:03.819> coal<00:02:04.299> or

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
inventory it will either take coal or

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.690 
inventory it will either take coal or
charcoal<00:02:04.990> now<00:02:05.560> I've<00:02:05.710> got<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.039> in<00:02:06.159> my<00:02:06.310> inventory

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
charcoal now I've got it in my inventory

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.450 
charcoal now I've got it in my inventory
right<00:02:07.030> here<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.389> I<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.719> already<00:02:07.899> move<00:02:08.319> and<00:02:08.619> you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
right here so I can already move and you

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.720 
right here so I can already move and you
can<00:02:09.490> just<00:02:09.789> use<00:02:10.230> WASD<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.710> move<00:02:12.069> around<00:02:12.400> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
can just use WASD to move around and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.590 
can just use WASD to move around and
it's<00:02:13.270> easy<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.080> go<00:02:14.230> up<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.650> it's<00:02:15.610> X<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.210> go<00:02:16.390> down

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
it's easy to go up and it's X to go down

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.259 
it's easy to go up and it's X to go down
so<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.950> simply<00:02:18.370> control<00:02:19.060> this

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
so like that you can simply control this

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.860 
so like that you can simply control this
thing<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.750> fly<00:02:19.900> around<00:02:19.959> let<00:02:20.379> me<00:02:20.409> go<00:02:20.530> to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
thing and fly around let me go to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.949 
thing and fly around let me go to
five<00:02:21.110> mode<00:02:21.459> like<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.360> when<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> go<00:02:23.930> a

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
five mode like that and when you go a

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.930 
five mode like that and when you go a
bit<00:02:24.080> fast<00:02:24.379> you<00:02:24.530> will<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.769> able<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.040> see<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
bit fast you will be able to see the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.199 
bit fast you will be able to see the
engines<00:02:27.040> giving<00:02:28.040> off<00:02:28.159> a<00:02:28.310> little<00:02:28.489> bit<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.700> smoke

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
engines giving off a little bit of smoke

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.520 
engines giving off a little bit of smoke
and<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.930> smoke<00:02:30.260> trail<00:02:30.560> right<00:02:30.769> there<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:32.530> off

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
and I smoke trail right there and off

back in there and off you go now about

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.430 
back in there and off you go now about
the<00:03:16.040> recipe<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.329> crossing<00:03:17.750> recipe<00:03:18.140> which<00:03:18.319> I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
the recipe the crossing recipe which I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.099 
the recipe the crossing recipe which I
just<00:03:18.650> showed<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.940> will<00:03:20.150> probably<00:03:20.299> be<00:03:20.810> made

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
just showed you it will probably be made

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.949 
just showed you it will probably be made
a<00:03:21.140> bit<00:03:21.560> more<00:03:21.829> difficult<00:03:22.069> with<00:03:22.480> using<00:03:23.480> pistons

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
a bit more difficult with using pistons

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.659 
a bit more difficult with using pistons
and<00:03:24.170> such<00:03:24.409> in<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.739> future<00:03:25.069> because<00:03:25.639> it's

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
and such in the future because it's

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.690 
and such in the future because it's
quite<00:03:26.000> cheap<00:03:26.859> but<00:03:27.859> as<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.310> see<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.579> also

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
quite cheap but as you can see it also

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.360 
quite cheap but as you can see it also
uses<00:03:28.940> quite<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.690> bit<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.019> coal<00:03:30.319> which<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.160> good

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
uses quite a bit of coal which is good

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.620 
uses quite a bit of coal which is good
too<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:32.319> balance<00:03:33.319> out<00:03:33.880> how<00:03:34.880> much<00:03:35.120> how

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
too to balance out how much how

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.809 
too to balance out how much how
effective<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.739> thing<00:03:37.069> is<00:03:37.220> for<00:03:37.400> traveling

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
effective this thing is for traveling

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.430 
effective this thing is for traveling
because<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.209> can<00:03:38.359> actually<00:03:38.870> turn<00:03:39.049> really

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
because you can actually turn really

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.000 
because you can actually turn really
quickly

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
quickly

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.240 
quickly
oops<00:03:40.669> no<00:03:41.450> no<00:03:41.720> no<00:03:43.180> well<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:45.620> happens<00:03:46.010> when

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
oops no no no well and that happens when

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.150 
oops no no no well and that happens when
you<00:03:47.200> drive<00:03:48.200> or<00:03:48.470> float<00:03:49.400> into<00:03:49.879> something<00:03:50.739> or<00:03:51.739> fly

you drive or float into something or fly

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.819 
you drive or float into something or fly
into<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.699> tree<00:03:53.030> or<00:03:53.209> whatever<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:54.410> weaker

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
into a tree or whatever the weaker

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.009 
into a tree or whatever the weaker
blocks<00:03:55.099> it<00:03:55.310> will<00:03:55.489> its<00:03:55.639> explode<00:03:56.269> but<00:03:56.480> when<00:03:56.930> you

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
blocks it will its explode but when you

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.920 
blocks it will its explode but when you
crash<00:03:57.410> into<00:03:57.590> say<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.459> house<00:03:58.819> made<00:03:59.419> of<00:03:59.449> out<00:03:59.900> of

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
crash into say a house made of out of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.339 
crash into say a house made of out of
cobblestone<00:04:00.290> nothing<00:04:01.040> will<00:04:01.340> explode<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.349> this

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
cobblestone nothing will explode so this

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.089 
cobblestone nothing will explode so this
one's<00:04:03.530> still<00:04:03.769> here<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.329> you<00:04:05.329> can<00:04:05.540> break<00:04:05.840> it<00:04:06.099> as

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
one's still here and you can break it as

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.740 
one's still here and you can break it as
you<00:04:07.340> can<00:04:07.430> see<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.819> will<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.180> give<00:04:08.389> you<00:04:08.540> back

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
you can see that will just give you back

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.550 
you can see that will just give you back
the<00:04:09.109> die<00:04:09.349> and<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:10.310> airship<00:04:11.090> itself<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:12.349> that

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
the die and the airship itself like that

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.250 
the die and the airship itself like that
and<00:04:12.799> when<00:04:12.889> you<00:04:12.949> explode<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.629> like<00:04:14.629> I<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:14.900> did

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
and when you explode it like I just did

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.500 
and when you explode it like I just did
I<00:04:15.379> think<00:04:15.590> like<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.489> said<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.910> drops<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.299> few

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
I think like I said it drops a few

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.129 
I think like I said it drops a few
sticks<00:04:17.900> maybe<00:04:18.820> let<00:04:19.820> me<00:04:19.880> just<00:04:20.090> crashed<00:04:20.389> into<00:04:20.660> a

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
sticks maybe let me just crashed into a

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.250 
sticks maybe let me just crashed into a
wall<00:04:21.620> right<00:04:21.829> here

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.590 

and<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.950> think<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.220> also<00:04:25.340> blows<00:04:25.580> up<00:04:26.000> sandstone<00:04:26.540> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and I think it also blows up sandstone a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.650 
and I think it also blows up sandstone a
little<00:04:26.930> bit<00:04:27.140> let<00:04:27.620> me<00:04:27.770> try<00:04:28.070> once<00:04:28.550> more<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:29.060> just

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
little bit let me try once more I just

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.170 
little bit let me try once more I just
go<00:04:29.990> at<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.320> full<00:04:30.590> speed<00:04:30.860> as<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.730> can<00:04:31.850> see<00:04:32.030> it

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
go at it full speed as you can see it

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.300 
go at it full speed as you can see it
dropped<00:04:32.420> a<00:04:32.540> few<00:04:32.750> sticks<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.380> some<00:04:33.620> wooden
