00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
this dustbin picker-upper thingy

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.510 
this dustbin picker-upper thingy
completely<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> paper<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.590> staples<00:01:22.590> but

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
using is this piece of paper stapler and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.420 
using is this piece of paper stapler and
I'm<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:35.970> use<00:01:36.150> graph<00:01:36.509> paper<00:01:36.890> but<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.310> can

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
I'm gonna use graph paper but you can

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
I'm gonna use graph paper but you can
also<00:01:38.549> use<00:01:38.729> printer<00:01:39.270> paper<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.600> made<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.380> first

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
also use printer paper I made my first

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.399 
also use printer paper I made my first
one<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:40.979> printer<00:01:41.820> paper<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.790> basically

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.230 

you<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.890> an<00:01:49.979> angle<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you want to be at an angle so that the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.800 
you want to be at an angle so that the
dust<00:01:52.310> dust<00:01:53.310> has<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:54.149> wide<00:01:54.329> open

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
dust dust has a pretty wide open

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420 
dust dust has a pretty wide open
you<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> too<00:01:56.009> big<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> an

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you don't have to be a too big of an

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.469 
you don't have to be a too big of an
angle<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.210> you've<00:01:58.200> got<00:01:58.229> some<00:01:59.240> in<00:02:00.240> there

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
angle so that you've got some in there

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.649 
angle so that you've got some in there
so<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.100> fold<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.460> down

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
so you you just fold it down

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.980 
so you you just fold it down
that's<00:02:03.659> pretty<00:02:03.899> much<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:05.299> yeah<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.810> is

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that's pretty much it and yeah this is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
that's pretty much it and yeah this is
what<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.469> really<00:02:07.860> does<00:02:08.039> gonna<00:02:08.340> enter

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
what this is really does gonna enter

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.890 
what this is really does gonna enter
from<00:02:09.000> right<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.489> do<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.879> fold<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
from right you do is you fold this up

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.289 
from right you do is you fold this up
the<00:02:13.590> backside<00:02:14.069> up<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:15.000> want<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.209> leave

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
the backside up and you want to leave

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.699 
the backside up and you want to leave
some<00:02:15.540> flaps<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.379> these<00:02:16.530> little

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
some flaps right here these little

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.190 
some flaps right here these little
corners<00:02:17.099> because<00:02:17.790> they're<00:02:18.480> gonna<00:02:18.599> hold<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
corners because they're gonna hold the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.050 
corners because they're gonna hold the
the<00:02:19.890> same<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.540> project<00:02:21.540> together<00:02:22.909> from<00:02:23.909> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the same the project together from the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
the same the project together from the
back<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.540> front<00:02:24.659> what<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.739> want<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> do

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
back to the front what you want to do

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.440 
back to the front what you want to do
with<00:02:26.099> these<00:02:26.250> corners<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.060> fold<00:02:27.299> them

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
with these corners is just fold them

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.690 
with these corners is just fold them
over<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:30.230> that'll<00:02:31.230> represent<00:02:31.680> holding<00:02:32.400> with

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
over and that'll represent holding with

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.170 
over and that'll represent holding with
the<00:02:33.090> paper<00:02:35.599> once<00:02:36.599> you've<00:02:36.750> got<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.140> done<00:02:37.440> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the paper once you've got this done you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.440 
the paper once you've got this done you
simply<00:02:39.180> fold<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.409> up<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.030> over

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
simply fold this up and over

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.819 
simply fold this up and over
I<00:02:43.579> fold<00:02:44.579> up<00:02:44.760> cuz<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.959> gravity<00:02:46.319> tends<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.680> pull

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
I fold up cuz it's gravity tends to pull

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.410 
I fold up cuz it's gravity tends to pull
things<00:02:46.950> downwards<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.579> even<00:02:47.819> with<00:02:48.060> staples

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
things downwards and even with staples

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.349 
things downwards and even with staples
there<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.440> tendency<00:02:49.799> of<00:02:50.160> dirt<00:02:50.760> coming<00:02:51.030> out

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
there is a tendency of dirt coming out

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.440 
there is a tendency of dirt coming out
so<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:51.989> fold<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.349> upwards<00:02:52.709> just<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.099> be<00:02:53.220> safe<00:02:53.450> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
so I fold it upwards just to be safe and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.920 
so I fold it upwards just to be safe and
then<00:02:54.989> once<00:02:55.290> you've<00:02:55.470> got<00:02:55.500> both<00:02:55.890> sides<00:02:59.420> you<00:03:00.420> go

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
then once you've got both sides you go

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.180 
then once you've got both sides you go
ahead<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.200> bring<00:03:01.319> over<00:03:01.470> your<00:03:01.650> stapler<00:03:02.510> and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
ahead and bring over your stapler and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:14.680 
ahead and bring over your stapler and
you<00:03:05.190> go<00:03:05.340> ahead<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.670> staple<00:03:05.909> everything<00:03:06.359> down

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.479 

and<00:03:15.690> then<00:03:15.750> there's<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.530> corner<00:03:16.889> flap<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
and then there's the corner flap so you

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.580 
and then there's the corner flap so you
want<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.669> staple<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.120> too<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:22.440> just

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
want to staple that too and then it just

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.729 
want to staple that too and then it just
holds<00:03:22.919> it<00:03:23.010> down<00:03:23.069> right<00:03:23.549> there<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.380> then<00:03:25.380> same

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
holds it down right there and then same

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.860 
holds it down right there and then same
on<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.010> other<00:03:26.040> side<00:03:26.690> careful<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.810> your

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
on the other side careful on your

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:38.750 
on the other side careful on your
fingers<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.750> again<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.290> tend<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.769> do<00:03:37.919> here

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
fingers and again I do I tend to do here

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.589 
fingers and again I do I tend to do here
it<00:03:39.569> like<00:03:40.139> I<00:03:40.349> go<00:03:40.769> over<00:03:41.250> because<00:03:42.060> that's<00:03:42.329> both

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
it just helps a bit and then you've got

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.830 
what we folded up earlier I just I just
staple<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.150> all<00:04:00.299> together<00:04:01.220> check<00:04:02.359> and<00:04:03.359> if<00:04:03.750> you

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840

don't<00:04:03.959> want<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.169> staple<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.620> can<00:04:04.739> always<00:04:04.949> tape

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
don't want to staple you can always tape

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.309 
don't want to staple you can always tape
I<00:04:05.639> just<00:04:06.060> like<00:04:06.389> to<00:04:06.510> stay<00:04:06.690> because<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.169> bit

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
I just like to stay because it's a bit

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.610 
I just like to stay because it's a bit
stronger<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:08.870> there<00:04:09.870> you<00:04:09.930> go<00:04:10.049> one<00:04:10.319> staple

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
stronger but there you go one staple

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.110 
stronger but there you go one staple
here<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.519> then<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.060> other<00:04:12.150> side

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.250 

don't<00:04:15.989> okay<00:04:16.949> so<00:04:17.310> now<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.459> you've<00:04:17.699> got<00:04:17.940> it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
don't okay so now that you've got it

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.500 
don't okay so now that you've got it
this<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.380> basically<00:04:19.760> what<00:04:20.760> will<00:04:20.970> hold<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
this is basically what will hold the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.620 
this is basically what will hold the
dust<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.340> but<00:04:23.340> what<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.550> did<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.389> I

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
dust this is it but what I did is I

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.300 
dust this is it but what I did is I
added<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:25.169> handle<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.860> that's<00:04:26.040> pretty

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
added a handle and that's pretty

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.510 
added a handle and that's pretty
convenient<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.810> like<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.139> do<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:29.130> all

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
convenient and I like to do that so all

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.490 
convenient and I like to do that so all
you<00:04:29.699> need<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:29.970> do<00:04:30.090> for<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.900> get<00:04:31.380> your

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
you need to do for that is get your

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.159 
you need to do for that is get your
scissors<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:33.380> cut<00:04:34.380> away<00:04:35.600> just<00:04:36.600> along<00:04:36.930> this

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
scissors and cut away just along this

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.210 
scissors and cut away just along this
angle<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:39.150> as<00:04:39.990> you<00:04:40.229> do<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.650> want<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.100> go

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
angle and as you do that you want to go

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.550 
angle and as you do that you want to go
down<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:42.060> don't<00:04:42.690> want<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.930> go<00:04:42.990> down<00:04:43.169> too<00:04:43.350> much

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
down you don't want to go down too much

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.550 
down you don't want to go down too much
but<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.850> got<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> nice<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.840> get<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> nice<00:04:46.290> angle

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
but you got a nice you get a nice angle

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.350 
but you got a nice you get a nice angle
to<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:48.350> just<00:04:49.350> about<00:04:50.160> like<00:04:50.340> 2<00:04:50.700> inches<00:04:50.910> maybe

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
to it and just about like 2 inches maybe

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.830 
to it and just about like 2 inches maybe
3<00:04:51.870> inches<00:04:51.950> but<00:04:52.950> not<00:04:53.310> too<00:04:53.520> much<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.540> you<00:04:54.720> go

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
3 inches but not too much and you go

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.080 
3 inches but not too much and you go
down<00:04:56.060> now<00:04:57.060> once<00:04:57.360> you've<00:04:57.510> got<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.780> just<00:04:59.090> pull

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
down now once you've got it just pull

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.920 
down now once you've got it just pull
down<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.690> should<00:05:00.720> go<00:05:01.050> past<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:02.040> bottom

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
down and it should go past the bottom

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.440 
down and it should go past the bottom
for<00:05:03.930> convenience<00:05:04.530> purposes<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:06.000> now<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.210> can

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
for convenience purposes and now you can

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.820 
for convenience purposes and now you can
see<00:05:06.600> my<00:05:06.720> cut<00:05:06.960> isn't<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.350> good<00:05:07.560> it's<00:05:07.680> actually

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
see my cut isn't that good it's actually

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.100 
see my cut isn't that good it's actually
pretty<00:05:08.220> straight<00:05:08.520> not<00:05:08.760> angled<00:05:09.300> but<00:05:09.870> that's

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
pretty straight not angled but that's

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.850 
pretty straight not angled but that's
okay<00:05:10.440> cuz<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:11.190> know<00:05:11.310> might<00:05:11.729> as<00:05:11.760> well<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:13.470> so

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
okay cuz you know might as well and so

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.200 
okay cuz you know might as well and so
once<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.130> goes<00:05:14.250> past<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.760> could<00:05:14.910> pretty<00:05:15.090> much

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
once it goes past you could pretty much

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.360 
once it goes past you could pretty much
rip<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:15.750> it'll<00:05:15.990> go<00:05:16.050> straight<00:05:16.169> down<00:05:16.650> it's

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
rip it and it'll go straight down it's

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.700 
rip it and it'll go straight down it's
not<00:05:17.520> too<00:05:18.030> fast<00:05:18.300> anyway<00:05:18.660> once<00:05:19.110> you've<00:05:19.289> cut<00:05:19.530> it

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
not too fast anyway once you've cut it

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.070 
not too fast anyway once you've cut it
once<00:05:20.220> you've<00:05:20.370> got<00:05:20.550> this<00:05:20.700> handle<00:05:21.180> done<00:05:21.419> and

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
once you've got this handle done and

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.770 
once you've got this handle done and
you've<00:05:22.950> got<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.310> whole<00:05:23.340> project<00:05:23.639> done<00:05:24.000> you

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
you've got the whole project done you

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.159 
you've got the whole project done you
can<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.200> basically<00:05:25.620> have<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.479> handle<00:05:27.479> there

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
can you basically have the handle there

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.870 
can you basically have the handle there
comes<00:05:28.380> in<00:05:28.530> here<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.400> actually<00:05:29.610> a

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
comes in here and it is actually a

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.450 
comes in here and it is actually a
little<00:05:30.090> pretty<00:05:30.539> well<00:05:30.750> down<00:05:31.080> here<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.889> you<00:05:32.280> can

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
little pretty well down here and you can

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.490 
little pretty well down here and you can
empty<00:05:32.700> it<00:05:32.789> very<00:05:33.300> well<00:05:33.510> just<00:05:33.690> by<00:05:33.900> shaking<00:05:34.229> it

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
empty it very well just by shaking it

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.159 
empty it very well just by shaking it
and<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.979> dirt<00:05:35.190> will<00:05:35.400> get<00:05:36.090> hit<00:05:36.330> on<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:36.630> angles

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
and the dirt will get hit on the angles

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.279 
and the dirt will get hit on the angles
and<00:05:37.560> come<00:05:37.979> out<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.550> then<00:05:38.610> what<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.360> did<00:05:39.599> here<00:05:40.080> if

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
and come out and then what I did here if

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.589 
and come out and then what I did here if
your<00:05:40.650> handle<00:05:40.950> ends<00:05:41.190> up<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.340> bit<00:05:41.550> too<00:05:41.729> big<00:05:41.940> but

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
your handle ends up a bit too big but

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.690 
your handle ends up a bit too big but
you<00:05:42.690> could<00:05:42.900> simply<00:05:43.200> do<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.590> fold<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.280> corners

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
you could simply do is fold the corners

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.360 
you could simply do is fold the corners
in<00:05:44.970> words<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.630> then<00:05:46.229> stable<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.860> it<00:05:46.950> becomes<00:05:47.190> a

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
in words and then stable it it becomes a

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.210 
in words and then stable it it becomes a
nice<00:05:47.550> handle<00:05:48.510> it's<00:05:49.050> just<00:05:49.229> pretty<00:05:49.380> good<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.919> it

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
nice handle it's just pretty good and it

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.400 
nice handle it's just pretty good and it
works<00:05:50.400> pretty<00:05:50.610> well<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:51.120> yeah<00:05:51.780> this<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.020> it

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
works pretty well and yeah this is it

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.589 
works pretty well and yeah this is it
