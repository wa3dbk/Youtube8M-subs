 very good friends play is sergio se 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.369
 makes with you new with an achievement 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.680
 or trophy for this very complete guide that 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.060
 We are making handles ingrid 3 that 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.970
 let's do let's go for one of those 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.070
 prizes that is called carving 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.120
 to know what good is what 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.949
 what we have to do first is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.809
 get a forest you can do it from 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.579
 different forms is worth or ending 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.920
 with any large small patrol 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.739
 good as you to plant too 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.930
 you have them in some places perched on 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.000
 the armories that you find by the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.119
 streets but hey it's usually more 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.299
 easy to resort to murdering your 

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.729
 land grab enemies once 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.589
 have killed and well I would recommend that 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.689
 clean the first your notoriety 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.729
 so that so you can get closer 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.990
 in the back stealthily with your 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.670
 searches in hand 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.380
 It is obviously a musket and only 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.689
 it can be with the musket because 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 this one has a bayonet on the tip that is 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.340
 the bayonet for good that knife that 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 he puts on the weapon in front and serves 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 also dagger 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.079
 well then what do we have to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.060
 do approach from behind by 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.560
 stealthily to the enemy as we go to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.820
 see below 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.759
 let's have this rifle and when we do not have 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.439
 right on the enemy's back what 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.810
 we have to do is to inflate him 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.000
 literal as the description says not a 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.049
 weathervane we swell with the X in the case 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.619
 of xbox and in the case of playstation with 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.320
 the square button we would give to the and 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.929
 to shoot as if it were the shot 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.780
 normal in the case of xbox and in the case 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:59.209
 of playstation 3 as the triangle is worth 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.729
 so xy xbox and square triangle 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.679
 playstation3 in this way you will get 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.289
 your achievement or trophy without any 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.759
 problem and one more for our 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.289
 collection until the next video 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.310
