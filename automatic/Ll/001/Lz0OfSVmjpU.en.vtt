00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.770
 the second day hello sir navirad 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.960
 or hello first question how a 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.910
 big industrial company can she 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.150
 innovated off the beaten track 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.490
 when we talk about innovation 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.920
 you have to know that there are two big 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.680
 categories either you innovate in the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.960
 framework of what you do and these are 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.460
 innovations that is offered to jets 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.710
 continuous there it is relatively easy 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.820
 in existing processes with the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
 people you have in the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.809
 structures that you have exhausted 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.570
 innovations that are ruptures the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.700
 main innovations that for example 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.550
 renault led who were breaks 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.640
 for example, launching the low 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.539
 cost anywhere launching the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.789
 electric vehicle 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.039
 it was not done by generation 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.770
 spontaneous ideas inside the 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.750
 existing processes at a time there are 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.430
 someone in the company who gets up 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.380
 who said listen listen we can not 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.330
 continue like this at all costs 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.740
 and apex break and there from 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.270
 that moment this break it is not 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.189
 not that in the minds after for 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.280
 set up an organization 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.890
 specific project mode 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.409
 connected with the outside etc but so 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.080
 it causes a break that causes 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.960
 a break and we must put in place 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.450
 an adequate organization messina turn 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.220
 or but in fact I can create 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.380
 breakthrough innovations companies 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.560
 have to do two things first 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.689
 it is to anticipate the needs of future 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 often tend to react to requests 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.119
 consumers 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.820
 but I think they have to 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.680
 project from 6 to 15 years even 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.329
 times or even 20 years for really 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.340
 understand the future needs of 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.049
 consumers and then invest in 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.030
 economic models where new 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.640
 products for which there are no products 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.590
 still a well- defined market the only 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.689
 way that they can shape from 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.740
 new markets and also win a 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.530
 competitive advantage 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.899
 it's also innovating faster and here I 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.729
 think the renault close who 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.799
 consists in setting up a unit 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.850
 transversal like laboratory 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.560
 cooperative actually allows team 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.540
 engineering or design as well as 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.360
 marketing sales operations team 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.189
 really collaborate and approaches 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.870
 actually approached the innovation of 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.879
 different way in developing 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.069
 quickly a prototype for example the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.530
 tfc the consumers and then 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.269
 improve it step by step but see I am 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.989
 okay but in bullets two things 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.349
 quite different 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.090
 on one side there is the bet because there is 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.540
 part of paris imagine what are going 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.069
 to be the needs of customers in 15 years 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.739
 you are doing in Paris because we do not know 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.959
 not we suppose we analyze so it's not 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.189
 because finally in 10 or 15 years 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.599
 maybe the customers will have some 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.889
 something different maybe there was 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.970
 meanwhile breakthrough technologies 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.549
 pts who had something else 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.459
 so there is always a dimension paris 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.189
 in a part of innovation that's 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.189
 that's the side a bit in which he 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.620
 need a type of project management 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.750
 must be specific for us not to go 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.189
 no time to discuss the idea but 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.180
 that we spend our time putting it in 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.400
 application 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.439
 and then next to that there is innovation 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.840
 on which no one 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.579
 questions about its necessity 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.959
 for example painters and binder of 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.819
 batteries that allow to have a 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.500
 autonomy of 400 km rather than having 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.780
 150 m no one disputes it 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.190
 and here I totally agree there he 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.959
 is a matter of speed to a bet 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.579
 in place that allow a realization 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.989
 quick 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.729
 what are the most innovations 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.379
 important for tomorrow in the years 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.139
 to come we will see the consumers who 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.810
 will require products and services that 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.909
 actually embody 4 key attributes to my 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.159
 notice an affordable price that's it 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.930
 absolutely a must but beyond I think 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.299
 so it's simplification and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.799
 ease of use 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.310
 thirdly sustainability on the plane 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.680
 mental 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.769
 and fourthly the quality because 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.199
 someone can not compromise sir 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.549
 giving your opinion the innovations and 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:04.859
 will complain in the city tour 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.510
 we have to innovate the goal it's 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.599
 first of all innovation that is to say that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.879
 brought onto the market of objects or 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.409
 services that are valuable to 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.689
 Customers that's were we have several 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.820
 axes that are already drawn and on 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.049
 which we work and I think 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.120
 not that they will change a lot during 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.479
 years 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.030
 coming years there is first this 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.370
 that you mention that is to say that 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.780
 all of it there is a tendency to say 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.940
 finally what we want to acquire 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.620
 we have to see the value that 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.750
 actually assumes very cost 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.970
 reduced it assumes accessibility 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.740
 it assumes a very good marketing that this 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.210
 with the customer sailing advantage who can 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.310
 to draw that is very important 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.660
 hence the importance and development of 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.630
 low cost or the development of a 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.979
 number of products of this type 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.590
 secondly the sensitivity 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:56.110
 environment that is obvious which 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.610
 moreover is rather a differentiator 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.340
 without economic advantage ie 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.220
 that people are not ready to pay for 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.169
 the environment advantage by cons they 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.760
 choose according to that so 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.270
 the translation of that sir 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.930
 rejuvenate low cost development 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.060
 development of cars at zero 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.710
 emission development of cars 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.220
 autonomous development of cars 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.250
 connected 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.180
 here we have our roadmap 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.180
 thank you very much to you d f
