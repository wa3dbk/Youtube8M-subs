500<00:00:24.660> CI<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.400> waste<00:00:26.400> toner<00:00:26.640> motor<00:00:27.000> is

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
500 CI and the waste toner motor is

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
500 CI and the waste toner motor is
actually<00:00:27.810> located<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> right<00:00:28.920> side<00:00:29.189> under

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
actually located on the right side under

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.100 
actually located on the right side under
the<00:00:31.189> plastic<00:00:32.189> cover<00:00:32.460> where<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.300> bypass<00:00:33.840> tray

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the plastic cover where the bypass tray

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260 
the plastic cover where the bypass tray
is<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.500> that's<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.610> we're<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.090> to

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
is so that's what we're going to have to

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
is so that's what we're going to have to
remove<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.899> access<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.890> waste<00:00:38.610> toner

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
remove to get access to that waste toner

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
remove to get access to that waste toner
motor<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.590> show<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> how<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
motor and I will show you how to do that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.610 
motor and I will show you how to do that
now<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.570> basically<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> turn<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
now I'm basically going to turn off the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.130 
now I'm basically going to turn off the
machine<00:00:43.920> obviously<00:00:44.460> open<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.450> door<00:00:45.660> you're

machine obviously open the door you're
going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> take<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> five<00:00:46.890> screws<00:00:47.250> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
going to take out the five screws that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
going to take out the five screws that
hold<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> side<00:00:48.539> cover<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.100> two

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
hold this side cover on there are two

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.049 
hold this side cover on there are two
behind<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.920> bypass<00:00:52.920> tray<00:00:53.129> there's<00:00:53.460> two<00:00:53.699> below

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
behind the bypass tray there's two below

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.459 
behind the bypass tray there's two below
in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.539> handle<00:00:54.899> areas<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> then

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
in the little handle areas and then

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
in the little handle areas and then
there's<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> one<00:00:56.039> by<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.579> power<00:00:56.910> plug

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
there's the one by the power plug

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.599 
there's the one by the power plug
once<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> remove<00:00:58.230> those<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.250> panel<00:00:59.579> just

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
once you remove those the panel just

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.389 
once you remove those the panel just
slides<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:00.180> off<00:01:00.590> set<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> outside<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
slides right off set that outside and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
slides right off set that outside and
then<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.510> will<00:01:03.660> actually<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
then here you will actually see the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
then here you will actually see the
waste<00:01:05.010> toner<00:01:05.250> motor<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.390> little

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
waste toner motor was in this little

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.859

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
screws in the middle of this plate that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.219 
screws in the middle of this plate that
you<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> mess<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.930> because

you do not want to mess with because

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.810 
you do not want to mess with because
those<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.500> our<00:01:25.530> lineman<00:01:26.100> screws<00:01:26.369> these<00:01:26.610> ones

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
those are our lineman screws these ones

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
those are our lineman screws these ones
here<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.200> don't<00:01:28.290> need<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> take<00:01:28.770> those

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
those little clips there and it just

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.350 
those little clips there and it just
slides<00:02:25.650> straight<00:02:25.860> out<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.760> now<00:02:27.060> I'll<00:02:27.150> show<00:02:27.210> you

slides straight out so now I'll show you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.590 
slides straight out so now I'll show you
a<00:02:27.450> little<00:02:27.600> close-up<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.950> side<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
a little close-up on this side of the of

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.810 
a little close-up on this side of the of
the<00:02:30.780> motor<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.620> got<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.950> two<00:02:32.190> clips<00:02:32.490> one<00:02:32.670> on

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
the motor you got the two clips one on

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.220 
the motor you got the two clips one on
the<00:02:32.880> top<00:02:33.060> one<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> bottom<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.200> other

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the top one on the bottom on the other

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.140 
the top one on the bottom on the other
side<00:02:34.620> they're<00:02:34.830> both<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.370> bottom<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
side they're both on the bottom and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.490 
side they're both on the bottom and
those<00:02:36.270> are<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> ones<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.810> had<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.350> from

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
those are the ones I had to get to from

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890 
those are the ones I had to get to from
the<00:02:37.710> access<00:02:38.460> hole<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.150> now<00:02:39.300> once<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.720> it

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
the access hole so now once you have it

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.370 
the access hole so now once you have it
out<00:02:40.100> basically<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.250> reversed<00:02:41.700> to

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
out basically it's just reversed to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.650 
out basically it's just reversed to
reinstall<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:44.400> push<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.880> make<00:02:45.630> sure

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
reinstall it just push it in make sure

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.030 
reinstall it just push it in make sure
it<00:02:45.930> clips<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.680> going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> take<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.390> wire

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it clips I'm going to take this wire

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.040 
it clips I'm going to take this wire
harness<00:02:50.040> holder<00:02:50.700> I'm<00:02:51.240> going<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.480> remove<00:02:51.840> it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
harness holder I'm going to remove it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.720 
harness holder I'm going to remove it
and<00:02:53.060> relocate<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.960> hole<00:02:55.260> up<00:02:55.500> here<00:02:55.730> as

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and relocate it to the hole up here as

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.670 
and relocate it to the hole up here as
for<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.150> bulletin<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.780> then<00:02:58.410> I'm<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.620> to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
for the bulletin and then I'm going to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.520 
for the bulletin and then I'm going to
take<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.040> wire<00:02:59.220> out<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.460> this<00:02:59.760> harness<00:03:00.530> reclip

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
take the wire out of this harness reclip

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.380 
take the wire out of this harness reclip
that<00:03:01.770> it's<00:03:02.040> going<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.310> now<00:03:02.670> run<00:03:03.000> through<00:03:03.270> this

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that it's going to now run through this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.460 
that it's going to now run through this
one<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:04.560> down<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.100> plug<00:03:05.520> into<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.470> into

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
one and then down and plug into the into

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.670 
one and then down and plug into the into
the<00:03:07.590> new<00:03:07.770> waste<00:03:08.370> toner<00:03:08.610> motor<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:10.500> that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
the new waste toner motor so with that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.080 
the new waste toner motor so with that
and<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:10.920> think<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.190> reason<00:03:11.490> why<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.940> new

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and I think the reason why is the new

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.030 
and I think the reason why is the new
waste<00:03:12.300> total<00:03:12.660> motor<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> shorter<00:03:13.890> wire

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
waste total motor is a shorter wire

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.740 
waste total motor is a shorter wire
harness<00:03:14.460> so<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.790> needs<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.270> needed<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.630> be

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
harness so it needs it needed to be

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.040 
harness so it needs it needed to be
rerouted<00:03:16.200> in<00:03:16.470> order<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.830> reach<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.540> oops<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
rerouted in order to reach so oops I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.650 
rerouted in order to reach so oops I
actually<00:03:19.620> unpop<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:20.970> pop<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.180> back<00:03:21.480> in

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
actually unpop that and pop that back in

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.370 
actually unpop that and pop that back in
and<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.340> like<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.600> once<00:03:25.230> that's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and then just like that so once that's

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.170 
and then just like that so once that's
done<00:03:25.620> now<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:26.190> reassembly<00:03:26.850> I'm<00:03:27.060> going

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
done now it's just reassembly I'm going

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.350 
done now it's just reassembly I'm going
to<00:03:27.270> take<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.660> metal<00:03:28.230> plate<00:03:28.550> make<00:03:29.550> sure<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
to take the metal plate make sure it the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.170 
to take the metal plate make sure it the
middle<00:03:30.720> lines<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.170> with<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.470> plastic<00:03:32.190> nub

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
middle lines up with the plastic nub

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.670 
middle lines up with the plastic nub
there<00:03:33.450> so<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:33.990> gets<00:03:34.140> aligned<00:03:34.440> properly
