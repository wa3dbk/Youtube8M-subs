are<00:01:18.689> with<00:01:18.990> Italian<00:01:19.439> football<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> English

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
are with Italian football to English

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.210 
are with Italian football to English
football<00:01:20.780> surely<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.350> pace<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> game

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
football surely the the pace of the game

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
football surely the the pace of the game
I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.970> premier<00:01:24.240> league<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.869> quicker

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I think premier league is a lot quicker

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
I think premier league is a lot quicker
than<00:01:25.970> then<00:01:26.970> Italian<00:01:27.509> Syria<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.030> Italian

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
than then Italian Syria and Italian

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.120 
than then Italian Syria and Italian
Syria<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.450> more<00:01:30.720> tactical<00:01:31.500> work<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.920> well

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
Syria is more tactical work as well

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.630 
Syria is more tactical work as well
instead<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> Premier<00:01:33.630> League<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.640> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
instead of the Premier League and like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.390 
instead of the Premier League and like
in<00:01:35.820> Italy<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.299> live<00:01:36.479> football<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.650> he

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
in Italy you live football as a as he

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.539 
in Italy you live football as a as he
like<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.600> job<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> proper<00:01:40.380> job<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.829> here<00:01:41.159> just
