 own the gold ball nominees 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.779
 from the league mx the teams from the north 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 are dominating we are dominated by 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.120
 the goalkeepers jonathan attention

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.230
 of jesus crown of blue cross appear 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.330
 also there the goals received the least 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 thrashed as cirilo willow concludes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
 only but there are three from the north yes 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.789
 but I'm left with a crown like that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.200
 I think crown made in yours for 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.450
 keep 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.460
 devesa lateral jorge torres nilo de los

 tigers iván estrada de saints dárvin 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.770
 chávez de monterrey also three large 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.160
 candidates and three others from the north there 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 is it so 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.320
 only called could be a good one 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.359
 prize for the central defender quite 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.239
 a guayana or go to the crap and again 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.530
 of order and only region is that the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.269
 teams from the north have taken the caste 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.440
 for Mexican football it has to be said and 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.440
 They are doing things 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.590
 I say contention egídio arévalo that has 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.789
 gone to football in italy 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.729
 player of los xolos juan pablo 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.340
 rodríguez de saints and jesus zavala de 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.259
 the streaks of the monterrey could do 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.450
 also good options 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.350
 another of the other graphics 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.350
 different 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.069
 the candidates lucas wolves who had a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.079
 tremendous campaign daniel ludueña 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.289
 santos champion and christian el chaco 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.209
 giménez here is the defensive half 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.549
 egídio arévalo polo rodríguez y sabana 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.069
 what we are discussing there is no 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.929
 who you like them I 'll stick with egídio 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.099
 arévalo although good was made to football 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.849
 Italian but had a tremendous 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.849
 temporadón 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.380
 call was the team factor 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.880
 border another of the value nominees 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.939
 the best forward oribe peralta 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 christian benítez and iván alonso I think that 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.890
 the heart is already defined, it takes us to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.380
 walking and operating definitely and 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.349
 good not to belittle others 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.299
 but I think its years and seasons 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.849
 complete and this is interesting the best 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.549
 novice carlitos iron frame good of 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.739
 pachuca jose antonio garcia this defense 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.180
 of the pumas that also scored a goal 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.799
 also with very interesting conditions 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.790
 good frame I think the fight 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.120
 would be between good frame and Carlos 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.120
 iron 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
 and the technician is often the subject 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.560
 of immediate results 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.300
 benjamin galindo víctor males of you or 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.340
 ricardo el tuca ferretti other three of the 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.420
 world and totally agree with them 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.590
 and any of the others are 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:44.530
 very great strategists 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.629
 and here is what you tell me, Mauricio Morales 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.900
 francisco chacón or roberto garcía orozco 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.519
 but that these three to my taste ducks 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.590
 chacón is the one that more good 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.569
 ratings he had last season 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.569
 to put it in some way interest
