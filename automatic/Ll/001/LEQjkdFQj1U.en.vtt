they didn't say whether it's gonna be a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
they didn't say whether it's gonna be a
like<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.130> fall<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.640> Cybertron<00:00:29.970> universe

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
like in the fall of Cybertron universe

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
like in the fall of Cybertron universe
or<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.109> movie<00:00:31.410> universe<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:32.040> assuming

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
or in the movie universe I'm assuming

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.850 
or in the movie universe I'm assuming
it's<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.960> same<00:00:34.260> universe<00:00:34.649> as

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
it's going to be in the same universe as

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
it's going to be in the same universe as
the<00:00:34.980> bay<00:00:35.160> farmers<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.480> going

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the bay farmers just because it's going

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
the bay farmers just because it's going
to<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.840> coming<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.290> 2014<00:00:38.040> most<00:00:38.640> likely

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
to be coming out in 2014 most likely

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.650 
to be coming out in 2014 most likely
alongside<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.960> movie<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:42.090> guessing<00:00:42.629> that

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
alongside the movie so I'm guessing that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
alongside the movie so I'm guessing that
it's<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.649> universe<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.399> never

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
it's going to be that universe we never

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.869 
it's going to be that universe we never
know<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.270> gonna<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.629> Dark<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> Moon

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
know it's gonna be like Dark of the Moon

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.130 
know it's gonna be like Dark of the Moon
we<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.420> who's<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.690> make<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> or

Studios is going to be making the next
Transformers<00:01:22.740> game<00:01:22.970> honestly<00:01:24.170> they<00:01:25.170> did<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
Transformers game honestly they did a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350 
Transformers game honestly they did a
good<00:01:25.560> job<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.250> did<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.670> good<00:01:26.790> job<00:01:26.939> but

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
good job they did a really good job but

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
good job they did a really good job but
I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.509> somebody<00:01:28.200> else<00:01:28.380> needs<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> come<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I think somebody else needs to come in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
I think somebody else needs to come in
and<00:01:29.280> take<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> reins<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> shot<00:01:30.540> at<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and take the reins and get a shot at the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.319 
and take the reins and get a shot at the
Transformers<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.090> transformers<00:01:33.090> universe

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
Transformers the transformers universe

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.310 
Transformers the transformers universe
so<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:36.030> happens<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so we will see what happens but like I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.490 
so we will see what happens but like I
said<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> only<00:01:39.540> fact<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> game

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
said the only fact is that the game

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.889 
said the only fact is that the game
there's<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> game<00:01:41.100> coming<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.579> 2014<00:01:42.090> next<00:01:42.720> year

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
there's a game coming in 2014 next year

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.030 
there's a game coming in 2014 next year
and<00:01:44.720> all<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.780> speculation<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:46.890> know

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and all the speculation is we don't know

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
and all the speculation is we don't know
what<00:01:47.189> universe<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.820> gonna<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.630> think

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
what universe it's gonna be in I think

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.510 
what universe it's gonna be in I think
it's<00:01:49.290> gonna<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> movie<00:01:50.009> universe<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
it's gonna be in the movie universe I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's gonna be in the movie universe I
think<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.850> obvious<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:52.110> don't<00:01:52.229> know

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
think that's obvious and we don't know

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.069 
think that's obvious and we don't know
who's<00:01:52.500> gonna<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.770> making<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> mean<00:01:54.840> it's
