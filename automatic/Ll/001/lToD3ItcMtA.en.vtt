00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.260 
realized that the pacing of toriko seems
a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.750> bit<00:00:30.960> fast<00:00:31.349> like<00:00:32.000> every<00:00:33.000> chapter

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
a little bit fast like every chapter

Torico is very explosive and that's not
a<00:00:35.489> bad<00:00:35.670> thing<00:00:35.880> that's<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.390> good<00:00:36.719> thing<00:00:36.899> I'm

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
a bad thing that's a very good thing I'm

a bad thing that's a very good thing I'm
liking<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> content<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.420> each

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
liking all the content we get into each

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.420 
liking all the content we get into each
individual<00:00:40.230> chapter<00:00:40.559> toriko<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
some slow chapters to slow down the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
some slow chapters to slow down the
pacing<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> series<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.949> last<00:00:56.190> longer

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
pacing for the series can last longer

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.689 
pacing for the series can last longer
and<00:00:56.670> make<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.030> money<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.620> I've<00:00:58.699> noticed

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
and make more money and I've noticed

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
and make more money and I've noticed
with<00:00:59.879> toriko<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> past<00:01:00.899> couple<00:01:01.109> arcs

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
with toriko for the past couple arcs

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.439 
with toriko for the past couple arcs
there's<00:01:01.770> been<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> lot<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> explosive<00:01:02.910> chapters

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
there's been a lot of explosive chapters

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.270 
there's been a lot of explosive chapters
and<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> lot<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> content<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.530> each<00:01:04.650> individual

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and a lot of content in each individual

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.850 
and a lot of content in each individual
chapter<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> feels<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> pacing<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
chapter but it feels like the pacing of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
chapter but it feels like the pacing of
this<00:01:08.189> series<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.000> incredibly<00:01:09.540> fast

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this series is going incredibly fast

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.539

like<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.580> feels<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:12.750> already<00:01:12.930> almost

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
like it feels like we're already almost

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
like it feels like we're already almost
maybe<00:01:14.549> even<00:01:14.820> halfway<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.869> even<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> quarter

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
maybe even halfway or even a quarter

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
maybe even halfway or even a quarter
already<00:01:16.740> done<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.820> oreck<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
already done with this oreck like the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
already done with this oreck like the
way<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> arc<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> might<00:01:19.830> only<00:01:20.130> last

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
way this arc is going it might only last

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.499 
way this arc is going it might only last
another<00:01:20.850> 20<00:01:21.390> chapters<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.020> maximum<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.610> my

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
another 20 chapters at maximum so my

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
another 20 chapters at maximum so my
question<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.259> am<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> only<00:01:25.950> one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
question here is am I the only one

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
question here is am I the only one
noticing<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> pacing<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> Torico<00:01:28.290> recently

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
noticing the pacing of Torico recently

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
noticing the pacing of Torico recently
like<00:01:28.829> all<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.220> chapters<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.759> very<00:01:30.030> good

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
like all these chapters are very good

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
like all these chapters are very good
especially<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:31.110> chapter<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.280> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
especially this chapter but it just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
especially this chapter but it just
feels<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.820> there's<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.390> much<00:01:33.540> content

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
feels like there's just so much content

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
feels like there's just so much content
going<00:01:34.290> at<00:01:34.439> once<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.460> feels<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
going at once and it feels like the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
going at once and it feels like the
series<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.409> shonen<00:01:37.890> jump<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> forcing<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
series or shonen jump is forcing the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
series or shonen jump is forcing the
manga<00:01:39.150> cut<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.780> kick<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> try<00:01:40.740> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
manga cut to just kick it and try to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
manga cut to just kick it and try to
roll<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.220> Torico<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.210> series<00:01:42.479> will

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
roll out Torico to where the series will

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.749 
roll out Torico to where the series will
get<00:01:42.720> done<00:01:42.899> faster<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.740> very<00:01:44.070> scared<00:01:44.610> about

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
get done faster I'm very scared about

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
get done faster I'm very scared about
that<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> lot<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.259> loved

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that because there's a lot to be loved

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
that because there's a lot to be loved
from<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.070> series<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:47.610> worried<00:01:48.060> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
from this series and I'm worried a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
from this series and I'm worried a
shounen<00:01:48.899> jump<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.229> trying<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.310> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
shounen jump is trying to do that but I
