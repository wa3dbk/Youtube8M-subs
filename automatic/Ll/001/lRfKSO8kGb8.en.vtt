 carries in nerves and in all 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.229
 moods of the body agitated in the opposite direction

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.540
 view of the sailor who leaves him to perish 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.310

 engulfed for ever he wants to throw himself 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.560
 after him in the sea the philosopher 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.990
 pangloss prevents it 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.870
 it proves that the harbor of lisbon 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.110
 had been formed on purpose so that this 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.840
 Anabaptists if drowned while he

 to prove a priori the ship is

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.159
 were carried on a board 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.269
 when they get back to them a little bit 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.269
 walked to lisbon 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.400
 they had some money with them 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.519
 which he hoped to save himself from the end 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.019
 after escaping the storm 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.090
 hardly have they set foot in the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.549
 city ​​crying the death of their 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.000
 benefactor they feel the earth 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.920

 of lisbon and November 1, 1755 end 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.849
 of note the sea rises in 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.859
 bubbling in the harbor and break the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.930
 vessels that are languishing 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.219
 swirls of flames and ashes 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.949
 covers streets and squares 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.719
 public houses collapsed the 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:56.199
 roofs are overturned on the foundations 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:58.329
 and the fundamentals disperse 30000 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.859
 people of all ages and sex 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.349
 are crushed under ruins 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.719
 the sailor said whistling and 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.599
 swear there will be something to gain 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.180
 here what can be the reason 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.099
 sufficient of this phenomenon was saying 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.019
 Pangalos 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.669
 here is the last day of the world was crying 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.040
 candid 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.079
 the sailor runs a continent in the middle 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.419
 debris clash with death for 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.139
 find money we find 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.609
 empare gets drunk having to drink his wine 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.129
 buy the favors of the first girl 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.079
 goodwill he meets on the 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.930
 ruins of destroyed homes and at 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.430
 middle of the dying and the dead 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.959
 pangalos the shot is however by the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120
 handle 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.129
 my friend told him it is not 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.879
 well you missed the reason 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.019
 universal 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.959
 you are taking time off your head and without 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.840
 replied the other I was born sailors 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.849
 in batavia I walked four times on the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.310
 crucifix in four trips to Japan 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.819
 you have found your man with your 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.819
 universal reason 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.669
 some stone chips had hurt 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.319
 candid 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:07.900
 they were lying in the street and 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.599
 covered with debris he said to pons gloss 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.019
 is alas get me some wine and 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.780
 oil 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.549
 I 'm dying this earthquake 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.159
 is not a new thing answered 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.019
 pangloss the city of lima experienced the 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:21.910
 same shakes in america 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.760
 last year 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.380
 same causes same effects ago 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.280
 certainly a sulfur trail under 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.470
 earth from the image until lisbon 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.530
 nothing is more probable of the candid but 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.480
 for god a little oil and wine 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.410
 how likely replied the philosopher 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.300
 I maintain that the thing is demonstrated 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.070
 candid loses consciousness and panglose 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.080
 brings him to a little water of a 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.210
 neighboring fountain 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.460
 the next day having found some 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.830
 provisions of mouth while slipping to 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.230
 through rubble he repairs air a 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.400
 little strength 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.080
 then they worked as 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.640
 others to relieve locals escape 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.800
 to death 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.660
 some citizens rescued by them their 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.310
 gave as good a dinner as 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.770
 could in such a disaster 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.990
 it is true that the meal was sad 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.660
 the guests shower their bread with their 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.220
 tears but panglose the consoles to in 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.650
 assuring them that things could not 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.650
 to be otherwise because he says 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.660
 all this is the best because 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.580
 if it is a volcano in lisbon it does not 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.080
 could be elsewhere because it is 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.280
 impossible that things are not 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.820
 where they are 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.790
 because everything is a little black man 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.510
 familiar with the inquisition which was at 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.810
 next to him 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.400
 politely price the word and says 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.440
 apparently that sir do not believe in 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.180
 original sin 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.919
 because if everything is at best so there is 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.120
 had neither fall nor punishment 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.890
 I humbly ask for forgiveness 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.390
 your excellence answered pangloss 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.610
 even more politely 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.100
 because the fall of man and the 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.830
 curse necessarily entails in 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.090
 the best of all possible worlds 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.090
 sir do not believe liberty 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.820
 tell the familiar your excellence 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.330
 excuse me says pang the bone freedom 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.620
 can subsist with the absolute necessity 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.740
 because it was necessary for us 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.130
 fussion free because finally the will 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.430
 determined anglo it was in the middle of his 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.710
 sentence when the familiar made a sign of 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.630
 head to his and staff ye who served him to 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:29.830
 drink port wine or oporto end of 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.120
