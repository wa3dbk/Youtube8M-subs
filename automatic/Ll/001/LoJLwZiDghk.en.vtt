I've created a background that's not

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.830 
I've created a background that's not
very<00:02:19.980> exciting<00:02:20.610> because<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.240> image<00:02:21.690> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
very exciting because the image is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.930 
very exciting because the image is
really<00:02:22.320> too<00:02:22.650> small<00:02:23.100> isn't<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.790> only

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940

really too small isn't it it's only
about<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.240> hundred<00:02:24.480> pixels<00:02:24.900> by<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> hundred

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
about a hundred pixels by a hundred

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.350 
about a hundred pixels by a hundred
pixels<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.250> doesn't<00:02:26.880> make<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> great

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
pixels that doesn't make a great

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.420 
pixels that doesn't make a great
background<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:28.440> that's<00:02:28.590> okay<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.190> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
background but that's okay because the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.520 
background but that's okay because the

but I could repeat it for example in a

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
open now one of the tricks here is I

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.540 
open now one of the tricks here is I
want<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.260> make<00:03:55.380> sure<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.920> tell<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
want to make sure that I tell the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.960 
want to make sure that I tell the
software<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.239> fill<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:58.290> page<00:03:58.590> with<00:03:59.550> my

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
software to fill the page with my

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.520 
software to fill the page with my
background<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:00.750> I'm<00:04:00.989> gonna<00:04:01.080> go<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.380> this

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
background so I'm gonna go like this

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.729 
background so I'm gonna go like this
fill<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.459> hundred<00:04:03.360> percent<00:04:03.480> by<00:04:04.290> 100

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
fill this a hundred percent by 100

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.160 
fill this a hundred percent by 100
percent<00:04:04.830> rather<00:04:05.640> than<00:04:05.910> by<00:04:06.090> pixels<00:04:06.600> I'm<00:04:06.930> using

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
percent rather than by pixels I'm using

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.880 
percent rather than by pixels I'm using
percentage<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.610> makes<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.239> background

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
percentage so it makes the background

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.430 
percentage so it makes the background
relative<00:04:10.890> or<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.489> weight<00:04:11.660> responsive<00:04:12.660> to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
relative or in a weight responsive to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.190 
relative or in a weight responsive to
the<00:04:13.560> size<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.970> browser<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.930> now<00:04:16.049> I'm<00:04:16.140> gonna

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
the size of the browser so now I'm gonna

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.220

the browser window the image is still
100%<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.180> background<00:04:35.680> this<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.950> basically

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
100% of the background this is basically

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.600 
100% of the background this is basically
the<00:04:38.780> whole<00:04:38.810> idea<00:04:39.350> behind<00:04:39.440> responsive<00:04:40.430> web

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
the whole idea behind responsive web

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
design or relative Web Design because

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.210 
design or relative Web Design because
the<00:04:44.030> image<00:04:44.480> will<00:04:44.690> always<00:04:45.080> be<00:04:45.230> relative<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.919> the

size<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.850> the<00:04:46.910> window<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.780> this<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.139> great

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
size of the window so this is a great
