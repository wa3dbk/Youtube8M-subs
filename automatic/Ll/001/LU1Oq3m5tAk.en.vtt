00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.659
 and now the late Cologne decadence 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.839
 The story about the Cologne subway construction has been crime thriller quality theft 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.939
 Cover up even a dead mega project that will be safe for millions of people 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.729
 should now a single pile of rubble 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.670
 and who is responsible for this he has been watching Kurt Beck 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.380
 The research of Jan Schmitt and Georg Wellmann prove the control as long 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.890
 Bechtle was ruled 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 it was just gone 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.740
 to build the railway 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.360
 a year ago, the city archives collapsed and killed two people 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.170
 irreplaceable writings and books were destroyed 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.250
 rather, the prosecution determined 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.270
 the more Paul board to the surface 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.640
 the fake building logs appear 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.300
 too much groundwater was pumped out 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.330
 tons of steel hangers should have been stolen instead of in the walls 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.950
 install 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 also on affected 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.430
 but who had the responsibility for the construction projects and how he supervised 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 The highest instance is the so-called technical supervisory authority at the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.720
 District Government Dusseldorf 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.730
 the supervision is an independent entity which has not been a construction project of its own 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.370
 she does not have responsibility on sight 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.460
 Hope that we have noticed 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 lets on it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.120
 and how does an agency take responsibility 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.650
 CD rules 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.210
 in the case of the Kubon to be built for the Cologne public transport KVB 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.850
 the responsibility of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia over on the 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.330
 District Government Dusseldorf 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.840
 transfers it to the city of Cologne 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.040
 at the end of KVB the stock corporation 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.260
 in other words, the privatized builder eventually oversees himself 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.270
 the ideas 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.870
 To take over the client and building supervision in one hand 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.900
 contradicts 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.299
 Next 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.549
 would apply in Germany 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.519
 imaginations 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.899
 control 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.499
 already in 2002 KVB wanted to have the building supervision 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.049
 that was forbidden by the district government in Dusseldorf at that time 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.039
 their justification lacking expertise 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.069
 then the view is then on the Cologne transport companies 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.259
 passed over somehow 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:42.109
 Even before our interview, we ask the district government to see when 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.349
 that was 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.749
 and now the standard exact time I can not say it myself 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.629
 but anyway, we were involved in the process of getting involved 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.620
 that we stand to participate are beings of so-called bearer of public 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.069
 concerns 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.929
 but now I can not tell you the exact day and hour 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:04.349
 Karl's hour would year-olds as well as their looks - for years to come 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.179
 but on 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.319
 the post will be presented again this also won 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:12.789
 So off 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.599
 from own experience 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.549
 being with him is not easy, but his responsibility should not now 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.939
 after cake 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.909
 Even after the interview is learned by the district government duty 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.739
 According to the city and KVB this was in 2005 after the city of KVB engineers to 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.389
 Had provided 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.579
 From now on, the Cologne transport companies were able to do it themselves 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.079
 decide 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.589
 and how often is checked 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.049
 an external auditor engineer the KVB employees 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.699
 could not even go to the construction site 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.469
 you wanted to save costs 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.439
 The test engineer does not pretend that there are massive problems at the construction site 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.650
 gave to the city archive 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.529
 and even the construction companies sounded the alarm 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:57.929
 Vienna Monitor present internal protocols states 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.379
 the situation does not tolerate any further delay 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.249
 there is a risk to the stability of the excavation pit 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:13.159
 it is urgent to pump extra water before issuing one 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.879
 arrangement 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.269
 at his interrogation after the accident, the test engineer said 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.329
 actually you would have to impose a construction freeze to progress 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.249
 have to 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.779
 but the KVB continued to build 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:27.779
 the Cologne public transport companies do not want to comment on this 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.439
 with reference to the prosecutorial investigation 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.400
 and the competent supervisory authority in Düsseldorf 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.509
 she trusted the suitcase was apparently blind 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.610
 only once every three months did an official visit the construction site 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.580
 the reason 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.629
 staff shortages 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.920
 Nirvana returnees can 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.360
 of which account 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 to dodge 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.870
 So the former staff was not enough 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.379
 By the way, it was not only possible to have it with us in Yodok 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.529
 right if they are the farmers here for a car, in fact only two for whole 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:06.539
 North Rhine-Westphalia 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.839
 in retrospect I have to say that was not enough 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.469
 in public construction projects there is no explicit separation between 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:15.669
 Builder and supervision 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.099
 this regulates a federal ordinance 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.259
 but that should actually apply to authorities 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.020
 In Brussels village they have been interpreted quite generous 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.849
 and also applied to private companies 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.930
 and so it was possible that a private builder such as the Cologne public transport 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:33.710
 supervises itself 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.710
 Björn Morper administrative practice degree 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.569
 which we have generally used 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.969
 I can not just say that's how I wanted it because somebody says it 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.009
 But for her men it was time to raise administrative practice 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.710
 that irresponsible 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.490
 that's right irresponsible can not always say yes 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.969
 Per cent my mother is even to blame when playing around with Ricardo Schulz 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.229
 that is this bridge organization 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.270
 I could have been a knife 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.270
 I can control even more technically perfect 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.300
 it's not illegal if I do that 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.240
 flow 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.509
 Build in the Munich subway 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:15.539
 with two dead 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.300
 a collapsed city archive has estimated amounts of damage 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.369
 which already exceed the construction costs 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:27.639
 out of originally 550 million we are son together nearly two and a half 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.999
 Used billions of euros 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.270
 open at the back
