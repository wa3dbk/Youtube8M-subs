00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
um I'm using CC but it's pretty much the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.150 
um I'm using CC but it's pretty much the
same<00:00:23.939> thing<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> want<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.039> you

want to create a new composition with

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.720 
want to create a new composition with
the<00:00:27.810> same<00:00:28.109> dimensions<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.009> photos<00:00:29.519> you'll

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the same dimensions as the photos you'll

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.510 
the same dimensions as the photos you'll
be<00:00:29.849> importing<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:31.169> you<00:00:31.410> want<00:00:31.589> to<00:00:31.650> press<00:00:31.859> ctrl

I on your keyboard
navigate<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.550> photos<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.570> you'll<00:00:36.719> be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
navigate to the photos that you'll be

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
navigate to the photos that you'll be
using<00:00:38.690> select<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.930> all<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.710> them<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.120> this

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
using select them all of them and this

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.680 
using select them all of them and this
is<00:00:42.180> very<00:00:42.480> important<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.559> check<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.430> box

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
is very important that we check the box

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.439 
is very important that we check the box
JPEG<00:00:45.690> sequence<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.000> make<00:00:48.000> sure<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
JPEG sequence and make sure it's

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.099 
JPEG sequence and make sure it's
selected<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:50.340> lock<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.030> files<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.690> can't

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
selected to lock all files if you can't

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.759 
selected to lock all files if you can't
find<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.590> files<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> then<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.590> aren't

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
find your files and then if they aren't

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.619 
find your files and then if they aren't
JPEG<00:00:56.280> images<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.760> example<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.239> might<00:00:57.449> say

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
JPEG images for example this might say

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.020 
JPEG images for example this might say
PNG<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.320> can<00:00:58.500> sort<00:00:58.649> gifs<00:00:58.949> sequence<00:00:59.399> but

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
PNG so you can sort gifs sequence but

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.490 
PNG so you can sort gifs sequence but
you<00:01:00.149> need<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.539> sure<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> images<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.379> all

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you need to make sure the images are all

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.590 
you need to make sure the images are all
the<00:01:01.590> files<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> same<00:01:02.550> file<00:01:02.760> type<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.329> are

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the files all the same file type and are

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
the files all the same file type and are
labeled<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.530> consecutive<00:01:05.220> order<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.910> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
labeled in consecutive order so you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.440 
labeled in consecutive order so you
can't<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.440> 202<00:01:07.440> then<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.400> 200<00:01:08.759> 20<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.360> then

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
can't have 202 then see 200 20 and then

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.109 
can't have 202 then see 200 20 and then
205<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.590> put<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:11.009> in<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
205 because they don't put them in the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.640 
205 because they don't put them in the
different<00:01:12.509> order<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> won't<00:01:13.229> work<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
different order and it won't work and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.050 
different order and it won't work and
that's<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:14.009> they'll<00:01:14.310> take<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> long<00:01:14.729> time<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that's all they'll take a long time to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.330 
that's all they'll take a long time to
set<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:16.110> want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.320> tick<00:01:16.470> JPEG<00:01:16.890> sequence

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
set up so we want to tick JPEG sequence

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.569 
set up so we want to tick JPEG sequence
and<00:01:17.549> press<00:01:17.670> import<00:01:18.890> then<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
and press import then we want to go to

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.749 
and press import then we want to go to
our<00:01:21.259> composition<00:01:22.259> settings<00:01:25.759> composition

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
our composition settings composition

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
our composition settings composition
settings<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.900> set<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.860> framerate<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
settings and we set the framerate to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.039 
settings and we set the framerate to
whatever<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.360> framerate<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.960> a

stop-motion<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.040> case<00:01:32.220> we'll

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
stop-motion to be in this case we'll

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.700 
stop-motion to be in this case we'll
make<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.640> 10<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> use<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
make it 10 because that's what I use in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
make it 10 because that's what I use in
stop<00:01:34.860> motions<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.509> ahead<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.899> drag<00:01:37.170> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
stop motions then go ahead and drag this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.580 
stop motions then go ahead and drag this
footage<00:01:37.740> onto<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> timeline<00:01:38.369> now<00:01:38.960> if<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.439> if

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
footage onto the timeline now if you if

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130 
footage onto the timeline now if you if
we<00:01:40.770> zoom<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.700> footage<00:01:42.119> goes<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.659> 5

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
we zoom in the footage goes for about 5

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.090 
we zoom in the footage goes for about 5
frames<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> has<00:01:45.509> about<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
frames which then it has about that it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039 
frames which then it has about that it
has<00:01:47.310> 30<00:01:47.610> frames<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.689> what<00:01:48.840> we're<00:01:48.960> going

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
has 30 frames in it so what we're going

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
has 30 frames in it so what we're going
to<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> we're<00:01:50.219> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> go<00:01:50.579> interpret

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
to do is we're going to go interpret

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
to do is we're going to go interpret
footage<00:01:51.420> main<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.740> we're<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.100> change

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
footage main and we're going to change

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
footage main and we're going to change
it<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> same<00:01:53.969> we're<00:01:54.479> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> change

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it to the same we're going to change

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.630 
it to the same we're going to change
assume<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.530> frame<00:01:55.770> rate<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> same<00:01:56.399> frame

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
assume this frame rate to the same frame

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.859 
assume this frame rate to the same frame
rate<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.149> composition<00:01:57.420> which<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.229> 10

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
rate as that composition which is 10

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
rate as that composition which is 10
then<00:02:00.869> make<00:02:01.229> sure<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.560> drag<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.070> out<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.579> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
then make sure we drag it out so it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
then make sure we drag it out so it
reaches<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.420> full<00:02:03.600> extent<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.469> footage

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
reaches the full extent of the footage

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.609 
reaches the full extent of the footage
length<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.710> press<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:09.320> RAM<00:02:10.320> preview

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
length and we will press the RAM preview

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.820 
length and we will press the RAM preview
button<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.880> preview<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
button so that we can preview it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.140 
button so that we can preview it
smoothly<00:02:13.830> at<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> frame<00:02:14.550> rate

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
smoothly at the frame rate

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.589 
smoothly at the frame rate
see<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:17.099> successfully<00:02:17.909> imported

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
see now we have successfully imported

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.869 
see now we have successfully imported
our<00:02:18.989> stop-motion<00:02:19.349> video<00:02:19.769> we<00:02:20.519> can<00:02:20.700> add

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
our stop-motion video we can add

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.199 
our stop-motion video we can add
whatever<00:02:21.239> effects<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:22.500> want<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.549> yeah<00:02:24.030> it's

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
whatever effects we want and yeah it's

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.600 
whatever effects we want and yeah it's
really<00:02:24.450> simple<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.590> lot<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.310> my<00:02:26.370> friends

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
really simple like a lot of my friends

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.550 
really simple like a lot of my friends
have<00:02:26.700> been<00:02:26.790> asking<00:02:27.120> me<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:28.049> pretty<00:02:28.349> hard

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
have been asking me and it's pretty hard

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.490 
have been asking me and it's pretty hard
to<00:02:28.830> explain<00:02:29.269> like<00:02:30.269> just<00:02:30.750> I'm<00:02:31.140> talking<00:02:31.440> to

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
to explain like just I'm talking to

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.369 
to explain like just I'm talking to
someone<00:02:31.709> or<00:02:31.920> over<00:02:32.430> text<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.110> yeah

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
someone or over text but in this yeah

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.839 
someone or over text but in this yeah
yes<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.069> it's<00:02:35.220> really<00:02:35.700> simple

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
yes you can see it's really simple

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.479 
yes you can see it's really simple
doesn't<00:02:36.510> really<00:02:36.780> require<00:02:37.440> much<00:02:37.890> knowledge<00:02:38.190> of

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
doesn't really require much knowledge of

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.640 
doesn't really require much knowledge of
After<00:02:38.940> Effects<00:02:39.299> previously<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.470> really

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
After Effects previously and it's really

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.319 
After Effects previously and it's really
good<00:02:40.829> because<00:02:40.860> instead<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.400> having<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.879> add<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
good because instead of having to add a

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.050 
good because instead of having to add a
fax<00:02:42.629> frame<00:02:43.049> by<00:02:43.260> frame<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.769> treats<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.250> as<00:02:44.340> any

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
fax frame by frame it treats it as any

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.750 
fax frame by frame it treats it as any
video<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.870> After<00:02:46.260> Effects<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.519> looks

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
video in After Effects and it looks

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.610 
video in After Effects and it looks
really<00:02:47.970> smooth<00:02:48.359> um<00:02:49.099> well<00:02:50.099> that's<00:02:50.430> all<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.299> now

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
really smooth um well that's all for now

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.289 
really smooth um well that's all for now
