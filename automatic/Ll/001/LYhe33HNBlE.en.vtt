adolescent stage
we<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.439> potential<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> rise<00:01:38.670> above<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
we have potential to rise above that to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.719 
we have potential to rise above that to
get<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> top<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.649> have<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.340> little

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
get to the top to have just a little

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.200 
get to the top to have just a little
better<00:01:42.060> view<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.649> could<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
better view of what there could be and I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.969 
better view of what there could be and I
think<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> potential<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.679> we<00:01:46.740> have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
think that's the potential that we have

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.959 
think that's the potential that we have
inside<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> us<00:01:47.929> we<00:01:48.929> need<00:01:49.079> something<00:01:49.850> we<00:01:50.850> need

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
something like that because the way
