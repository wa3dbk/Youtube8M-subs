recreation player but just my sort of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
recreation player but just my sort of
vision<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.830> changed<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.549> my

vision of the game has changed and my

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
vision of the game has changed and my
ability<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> sort<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> not<00:01:19.020> passes<00:01:19.500> quickly

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
ability to sort of not passes quickly

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830 
ability to sort of not passes quickly
and<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.340> knock<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> top<00:01:21.060> quickly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and also knock them over the top quickly

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.200 
and also knock them over the top quickly
on<00:01:22.140> point<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:23.250> definitely<00:01:23.640> changed<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
on point that's definitely changed and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.870 
on point that's definitely changed and
changed<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:24.990> way<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.560> better<00:01:25.880> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
changed for the way way better and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.920 
changed for the way way better and
that's<00:01:27.030> something<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.360> futsal<00:01:27.810> has

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that's something that futsal has

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
that's something that futsal has
definitely<00:01:28.350> given<00:01:28.560> me<00:01:28.740> personally<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
definitely given me personally and I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.410 
definitely given me personally and I
would<00:01:30.720> tell<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:33.060> don't

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
would tell you if it did it so I don't

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
would tell you if it did it so I don't
think<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.110> question<00:01:34.500> kids<00:01:35.100> are

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
think that that's a question kids are

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.069 
think that that's a question kids are
going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> trap<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.729> ball<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.450> futsal<00:01:36.840> so

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
going to trap the ball more in futsal so

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.440 
going to trap the ball more in futsal so
I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.560> lack<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.280> bad<00:01:38.970> first<00:01:39.210> touch

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
I think the lack of a bad first touch

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
I think the lack of a bad first touch
because<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.990> ball<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.290> heavy<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.860> sort

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
because of a ball that's heavy is sort

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.010 
because of a ball that's heavy is sort
of<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.460> moot<00:01:41.610> point<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:42.090> you're<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.630> worried

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
of a moot point if you're really worried

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
of a moot point if you're really worried
just<00:01:43.979> use<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> normal<00:01:44.399> ball<00:01:44.729> once<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> while

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
just use a normal ball once in a while

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.109 
just use a normal ball once in a while
and<00:01:45.720> futsal<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> size<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.310> normal<00:01:47.880> non

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
and futsal get a size for a normal non
