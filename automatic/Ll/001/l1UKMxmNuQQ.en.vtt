00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.110
 good day museum skatehal arnhem for 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.090
 circa park of you 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.589
 skatepark built in a church unique 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.589
 location and road and have it tested 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.759
 all right 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:43.460
 rather extreme park, I'm a little sister 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.809
 are quite bumps in the seasickness 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.109
 warners do not run completely smoothly 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.300
 as I said before is pretty good 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.680
 dessert would be on a mixer I would 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.019
 can act as skateboarders or hours 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.019
 more can see the ropes what fun of it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.409
 the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.960
 yes is kate arnhem you can just eat and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.280
 buy drinks 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.770
 it remains of course church you like 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.290
 no smoking inside may this blue inside 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.900
 have no alcohol purchased from 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.000
 both skateboards and even me even 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.920
 it shoes 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.750
 you are clear to obtain if you 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.750
 want to skate safely in a church 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.070
 skate hall Arnhem is still shipping 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.750
 is more focused on a mix and inliner 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.030
 it would be made entirely of wood and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.490
 that makes skateboarder a bit smoother 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
 a little too smooth in my opinion but also 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.570
 for skateboarders are a nice one 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 challenging obstacles in between 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.310
 and it's good for a few hours 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.310
 entertained
