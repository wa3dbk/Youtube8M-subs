00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
a problem but we're talking about next

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.400 
a problem but we're talking about next

generation<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.570> supposed<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.800> be<00:03:21.070> better

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
generation it is supposed to be better

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.010 
generation it is supposed to be better
on<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.810> next<00:03:23.250> generation<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:25.270> wasn't<00:03:25.810> then

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
on the next generation if it wasn't then

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.340 
on the next generation if it wasn't then
that<00:03:26.410> would<00:03:26.800> be<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.040> problem<00:03:28.020> so<00:03:29.020> I<00:03:29.050> don't

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350
