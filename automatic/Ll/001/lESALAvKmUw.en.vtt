lipstick<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:03.020> kind<00:05:03.230> of<00:05:03.290> give<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.590> bit<00:05:03.980> more

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
lipstick to kind of give it a bit more

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.750 
of a glossy finish in coral shade and
then<00:05:06.770> we're<00:05:06.860> just<00:05:06.890> gonna<00:05:07.070> lash<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.670> a

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
then we're just gonna lash it up a

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.910 
then we're just gonna lash it up a
little<00:05:07.940> bit<00:05:08.120> more<00:05:08.240> down<00:05:08.570> there<00:05:08.780> now<00:05:09.410> going

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
little bit more down there now going

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.690 
little bit more down there now going
into<00:05:10.130> hair<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:11.030> hair<00:05:11.330> is<00:05:11.600> really<00:05:12.110> easy<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:13.370> I

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
into hair the hair is really easy so I

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.500 
into hair the hair is really easy so I
just<00:05:14.060> section<00:05:14.780> my<00:05:14.900> hair<00:05:15.170> and<00:05:15.470> just<00:05:16.460> wrapped<00:05:17.360> it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
just section my hair and just wrapped it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.630 
just section my hair and just wrapped it
around<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:18.230> curling<00:05:18.710> barrel<00:05:19.160> I<00:05:19.310> didn't<00:05:19.550> even

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
around the curling barrel I didn't even

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.970 
around the curling barrel I didn't even
take<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.060> clamp<00:05:20.330> out<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.900> gives<00:05:21.170> a<00:05:21.440> Messier

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
take the clamp out this gives a Messier

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.310 
take the clamp out this gives a Messier
type<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.700> wave<00:05:23.000> because<00:05:23.540> I<00:05:23.630> really<00:05:23.930> want<00:05:24.110> these

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
type of wave because I really want these

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.430 
type of wave because I really want these
effortless<00:05:24.860> waves<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:25.880> I'm<00:05:26.240> alternating<00:05:26.870> the

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
effortless waves so I'm alternating the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.890 
effortless waves so I'm alternating the
direction<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:28.250> I'm<00:05:28.460> using<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.330> sections<00:05:29.720> to

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
direction that I'm using the sections to

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.750 
direction that I'm using the sections to
wrap<00:05:30.050> around<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.380> barrel<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:31.580> just

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
wrap around the barrel so that it just

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.690 
wrap around the barrel so that it just
has<00:05:31.850> more<00:05:32.330> of<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.810> kind<00:05:33.410> of<00:05:33.530> messy<00:05:34.010> effortless

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
has more of a kind of messy effortless

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.090 
has more of a kind of messy effortless
look<00:05:34.790> and<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:36.080> kind<00:05:36.320> of<00:05:36.380> gives<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.710> little<00:05:37.010> bit

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
look and it kind of gives a little bit

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.100 
look and it kind of gives a little bit
more<00:05:37.250> volume<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.910> hair<00:05:37.940> too<00:05:38.270> so<00:05:38.540> I<00:05:38.660> really

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
more volume to the hair too so I really

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.290 
more volume to the hair too so I really
really<00:05:39.320> like<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.560> but<00:05:40.430> do<00:05:40.580> make<00:05:40.790> sure<00:05:41.030> that

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
really like that but do make sure that

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.970 
really like that but do make sure that
you<00:05:41.480> do<00:05:41.690> hold<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.140> hair<00:05:42.320> around<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:42.830> barrel

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
you do hold the hair around the barrel

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.010 
you do hold the hair around the barrel
long<00:05:43.490> enough<00:05:44.000> when<00:05:44.210> you<00:05:44.300> do<00:05:44.420> this<00:05:44.570> since<00:05:44.840> we're

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
long enough when you do this since we're

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.110 
long enough when you do this since we're
not<00:05:45.200> removing<00:05:45.710> that<00:05:45.860> clamp<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:46.940> there's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
not removing that clamp just so there's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.700 
not removing that clamp just so there's
enough<00:05:47.360> heat<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.810> distributes<00:05:48.410> through

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
enough heat that distributes through

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.730 
enough heat that distributes through
each<00:05:48.950> section<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:52.270> then<00:05:53.270> for<00:05:53.480> the<00:05:53.600> bangs<00:05:53.870> now

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
each section and then for the bangs now

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.140 
each section and then for the bangs now
this<00:05:55.220> part<00:05:55.550> I<00:05:55.700> would<00:05:55.760> say<00:05:55.880> is<00:05:56.120> really

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
this part I would say is really

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.000 
this part I would say is really
important<00:05:56.750> that<00:05:56.870> way<00:05:57.140> you<00:05:57.200> just<00:05:57.470> don't<00:05:57.830> have

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
important that way you just don't have

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.380 
important that way you just don't have
your<00:05:58.160> hair<00:05:58.340> falling<00:05:58.850> in<00:05:59.000> your<00:05:59.030> face

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
your hair falling in your face

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.090 
your hair falling in your face
throughout<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.840> day<00:06:00.020> because<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.470> can<00:06:00.950> be<00:06:00.980> a

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
throughout the day because that can be a

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.400 
throughout the day because that can be a
pain<00:06:01.340> so<00:06:01.940> that's<00:06:02.090> why<00:06:02.210> I<00:06:02.240> just<00:06:02.600> hairspray<00:06:03.080> to

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
pain so that's why I just hairspray to

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.140 
pain so that's why I just hairspray to
add<00:06:03.530> some<00:06:03.770> texture<00:06:04.100> and<00:06:04.370> then<00:06:04.880> I'm<00:06:05.030> grabbing

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
add some texture and then I'm grabbing

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.410 
add some texture and then I'm grabbing
this<00:06:05.900> brush<00:06:06.290> and<00:06:06.590> just<00:06:07.220> back<00:06:07.490> combing<00:06:07.820> so<00:06:08.300> that

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
this brush and just back combing so that

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.730 
this brush and just back combing so that
everything<00:06:08.780> kind<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:09.020> stays<00:06:09.290> in<00:06:09.470> place<00:06:09.710> a

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
everything kind of stays in place a

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.860 
everything kind of stays in place a
little<00:06:09.980> bit<00:06:10.100> better<00:06:10.250> but<00:06:10.910> if<00:06:11.090> things<00:06:11.450> kind<00:06:11.810> of

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
little bit better but if things kind of

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.960 
little bit better but if things kind of
still<00:06:12.140> seem<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.470> slip<00:06:12.740> too<00:06:12.980> easily<00:06:13.400> then<00:06:13.760> once

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
still seem to slip too easily then once

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.060 
still seem to slip too easily then once
again<00:06:14.060> hairspray<00:06:14.780> it<00:06:14.960> back<00:06:15.440> comb<00:06:15.680> it<00:06:15.710> some

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
again hairspray it back comb it some

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.540
