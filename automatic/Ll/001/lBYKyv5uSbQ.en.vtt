that surprising um you know where are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.870 
that surprising um you know where are
these

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
these

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
these
where<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.360> these<00:01:45.540> people<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.380> come<00:01:46.409> nation

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
where do these people get to come nation

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
where do these people get to come nation
when<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> monsters<00:01:48.240> first<00:01:48.509> released<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
when the monsters first released and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
when the monsters first released and
then<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.640> confirmed<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:53.090> kind<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
then it's confirmed and then kind of I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.740 
then it's confirmed and then kind of I
guess<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.500> doesn't<00:01:55.710> work<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:56.570> they<00:01:57.570> give

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
guess it doesn't work and then they give

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
guess it doesn't work and then they give
you<00:01:57.840> another<00:01:58.079> confirmed<00:01:58.649> combination<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you another confirmed combination and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.289 
you another confirmed combination and
then<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.850> doesn't<00:02:00.299> work<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> anyways<00:02:02.299> that's

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
then that doesn't work so anyways that's

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.179 
then that doesn't work so anyways that's
my<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.689> rant<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:04.259> I've<00:02:04.560> wasted<00:02:04.860> about

but<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.659> does<00:02:22.840> work<00:02:23.109> so<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:24.400> breeding<00:02:25.359> time<00:02:25.569> is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
but it does work so the breeding time is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.099 
but it does work so the breeding time is
19<00:02:26.620> hours<00:02:26.980> which<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.639> something<00:02:28.629> she<00:02:28.930> got<00:02:29.079> a

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
19 hours which is something she got a

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.179 
19 hours which is something she got a
bit<00:02:29.409> wrong<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:30.819> off<00:02:31.120> file<00:02:31.389> a<00:02:31.719> lot<00:02:32.189> it

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
bit wrong but it's not off file a lot it

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.199 
bit wrong but it's not off file a lot it
will<00:02:33.730> say<00:02:34.030> 18<00:02:34.540> hours<00:02:34.870> 59<00:02:35.349> minutes<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.879> 59

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
will say 18 hours 59 minutes and 59

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.420 
will say 18 hours 59 minutes and 59
seconds<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.049> think<00:02:38.349> this<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.680> what<00:02:38.919> she<00:02:39.219> was

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
seconds I think this is what she was

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.979 
seconds I think this is what she was
trying<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.909> say<00:02:40.090> but<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.919> the<00:02:42.219> time<00:02:42.989> and

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
trying to say but that is the time and

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.819 
trying to say but that is the time and
then<00:02:44.879> they'll<00:02:45.879> take<00:02:46.090> another<00:02:46.389> 19<00:02:47.230> hours<00:02:47.349> for

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
then they'll take another 19 hours for

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.979 
then they'll take another 19 hours for
the<00:02:48.730> egg<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.120> hatch

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
the egg to hatch

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.550 
the egg to hatch
anyways<00:02:50.879> I'll<00:02:51.879> categorize<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.900> monster<00:02:53.409> as
