00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
little better realize that behavioural

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.769 
little better realize that behavioural
can<00:01:28.979> often<00:01:29.279> tell<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:29.579> difference<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.599> my

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:30.779 
can often tell the difference but my

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:32.929 
can often tell the difference but my
advice<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:32.009> anyone<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.639> wait

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
advice would not be for anyone to wait

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.440 
advice would not be for anyone to wait
until<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.719> bird<00:01:33.959> is<00:01:34.169> older<00:01:34.619> or<00:01:34.799> lays<00:01:35.729> an<00:01:35.939> egg<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
until a bird is older or lays an egg to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.779 
until a bird is older or lays an egg to
find<00:01:36.689> out<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.139> a<00:01:37.200> female<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
find out that it's a female because it's

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.219 
find out that it's a female because it's
best<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.149> know<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.509> sex<00:01:39.749> of<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:39.929> bird

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
for DNA's thing all you need is a small
blood<00:01:58.439> sample<00:01:58.499> which<00:01:59.069> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.309> obtain<00:01:59.429> when

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
blood sample which you can obtain when

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.690 
blood sample which you can obtain when
you<00:01:59.999> cut<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.329> birds<00:02:00.509> nails<00:02:00.929> or<00:02:01.700> something

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
you cut the birds nails or something

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.719 
you cut the birds nails or something
like<00:02:02.819> that<00:02:03.239> way<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.309> you<00:02:05.309> get<00:02:05.489> your<00:02:05.579> results

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
like that way and you get your results

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
like that way and you get your results
back<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.419> very<00:02:06.450> short<00:02:06.899> amount<00:02:07.169> of<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.289> with

anticipate behaviors and deal with some
problems<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.830> hopefully<00:02:15.959> could<00:02:16.959> save<00:02:17.290> your

problems and hopefully could save your

birds life if there is a disease or a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.089 
birds life if there is a disease or a
situation<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:22.439> specific<00:02:23.439> to<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.650> female

such<00:02:24.340> as<00:02:24.489> egg<00:02:24.670> binding<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.299> you<00:02:25.420> would<00:02:25.569> know

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
such as egg binding that you would know

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.910 
such as egg binding that you would know
about<00:02:25.959> because<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.349> would<00:02:26.470> know<00:02:26.590> right<00:02:26.620> away

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
about because you would know right away

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.289 
about because you would know right away
that<00:02:27.189> your<00:02:27.310> bird<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.579> female<00:02:27.909> and<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.180> would

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
that your bird is female and that would

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.910 
that your bird is female and that would
be<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> possibility

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
be a possibility

DNA<00:02:30.670> sexing<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.360> as<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.840> said<00:02:32.049> very<00:02:32.260> inexpensive

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
DNA sexing is as I said very inexpensive

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.670 
DNA sexing is as I said very inexpensive
it's<00:02:33.069> about<00:02:33.220> $20<00:02:33.940> $25<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.989> it's<00:02:35.379> highly

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
it's about $20 $25 and it's highly

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.250 
it's about $20 $25 and it's highly
recommended
