00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.039

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.910
 maybe a great alternative 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 and a bit healthier too 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.399
 feed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.200
 The main ingredient is this avocado 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:41.879
 if you have won as interest 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:44.030
 then stay tuned until today 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.590
 open the pudding 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.590
 and it's pretty easy 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.680
 you just need something cute for example 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.320
 wanker cocoa powder gave a pinch 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320
 salt and of course an avocado 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:11.170
 First, the abo cable in half 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.170
 cut and take out the nuclear 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.540
 you can find the avocado and a nice one 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.500
 rest bowl since I am a stab mixer 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.500
 puree 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.280
 and of course using other mixa 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.150
 up grades and to the person included long 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.770
 says he himself meant few off the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.750
 Well, they are ideally suited 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.360
 avocados also lead to a regulated 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.590
 sugar rise which is why they are best for 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.590
 diabetics are ready 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.370
 That's why you should not of the good 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.370
 avocados melt 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.780
 because the duty-poland that now a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.780
 is beautifully green 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.650
 then a pinch of salt is added 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.790
 something cocoa powder I always take like that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.319
 three tablespoons 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.720
 but that would have to be done in the end 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.090
 It's best to do it quickly 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.300
 and then the same amount at the fork 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.040
 change in the cocoa powder it is 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.630
 important that it is in any cacau 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.630
 is unsolved 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.540
 then mix everything nice 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.840
 then you have to finish for that too 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.569
 I like to pretend this way 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.000
 Wirtepaar delicious healthy and beautiful 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.319
 Dangerous is the consistency I think 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.519
 personally better than conventional 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.930
 pudding and then I have no 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.930
 bad conscience of the nation 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.010
 I like to try made of satin 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.999
