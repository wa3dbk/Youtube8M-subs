 The third episode of the mod review series on 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 name olson dollars and this mod 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.330
 adds two new types of ore as you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 see armor weapons and some weird 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 sticks and two new mobs so well let's start 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 from this ore 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.910
 this is what this kind of arruda looks like 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.350
 called sapphire that's how you see from 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.450
 Sanitary armor 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 and here are the weapons from the infer and so on 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.100
 sapphire armor and weapons absolutely 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.379
 same as diamond here let me 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.410
 I will show you here what it looks like 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 so you see I remember completely replenishes 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.109
 my armor is also like diamond 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.979
 looks so let's take it off so we go 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.890
 further but how to make a weapon you know 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 all according to the standard scheme 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 so move on to the next gun 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.270
 the following glad this is our red diamond 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.259
 so she called here is what it looks like 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.810
 red diamond and this is what weapons look like 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.009
 unfortunately the developers are not mod 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.939
 Red diamond armor added here 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.840
 Well, okay, make this weapon too 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.680
 standard scheme as you all know so much 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.600
 and move on it we have two new 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.439
 moba so the first one could have it let's 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:53.369
 I will show you so constantly easy 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:57.360
 so first about it we have a gnome 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.630
 here's how it looks to us but seemingly 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.759
 the usual dwarf he has a lot 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.369
 lives around 25 and he is friendly for you 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.200
 if you don't touch him, he won't bother you 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.599
 will touch so 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.879
 move on to the second mob by the way this could 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.060
 It does not start dropping, and he's fighting against 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:23.719
 enemy mobs well for their exact 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.609
 get away get away get away so let's go to the second 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:32.060
 mobu 2 could this elf that's how elf will come out 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:35.180
 the elf is also friendly and he will also 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.939
 kill enemy mobs he shoots 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.079
 nothing drops by arrows except 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:44.120
 experience well and helps you if you are so 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.659
 same you will not touch glad but 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.189
 I warn elves and gnomes unfriendly 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.500
 each other and they will beat each other 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.629
 as you see it already 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.250
 Alpha shoots too nothing arrows 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.400
 dropping like gnomes 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.750
 so let's get to that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.239
 remove the creative and move on to these 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.010
 strange chopsticks are very excellent chopsticks 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.459
 even i don't know how to just call them 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.069
 sticks not sticks whatever you want to call 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:25.669

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.970
 by lightning saw the same say awesome 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:31.220
 sticks need a little wait and again about by 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.979
 let's try to kill someone with 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.949
 using this wand so well let's go over to 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:42.729

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.580
 to craft 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:05.410
