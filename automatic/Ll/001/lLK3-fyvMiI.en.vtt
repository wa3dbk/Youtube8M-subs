everything<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.630> game<00:03:23.870> has<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.260> load<00:03:24.710> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
everything in this game has to load and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.700 
everything in this game has to load and
I'm<00:03:25.280> using<00:03:25.520> my<00:03:25.670> ps2<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.540> usually<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.440> thought

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
I'm using my ps2 and usually I thought

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.440 
I'm using my ps2 and usually I thought
the<00:03:27.830> ps2<00:03:28.250> kind<00:03:28.550> of<00:03:28.610> cuts<00:03:28.790> down<00:03:28.940> on<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.270> loading

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
the ps2 kind of cuts down on the loading

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.600 
the ps2 kind of cuts down on the loading
times<00:03:29.810> but<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.800> know<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.100> was<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:31.340> a

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
times but you know that was just a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.220 
times but you know that was just a
PlayStation<00:03:32.270> at<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.510> time<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.900> know<00:03:33.020> just

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
PlayStation at the time you know just

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.170 
PlayStation at the time you know just
had<00:03:33.590> really<00:03:33.950> crappy<00:03:34.370> load<00:03:34.640> times<00:03:34.910> with

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
had really crappy load times with

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.720 
had really crappy load times with
everything<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.770> mean<00:03:36.800> it<00:03:37.250> doesn't<00:03:37.490> help

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
everything and I mean it doesn't help

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.520 
everything and I mean it doesn't help
that<00:03:37.820> I'm<00:03:38.120> also<00:03:38.360> playing<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.930> once<00:03:39.320> again

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that I'm also playing it once again

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.190 
that I'm also playing it once again
through<00:03:39.710> the<00:03:39.800> easycap<00:03:40.520> so<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.820> have<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.200> couple

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
of bring second delay so you're not a

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.780

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.220 
was like I think for where I lived was
more<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.310> Mortal<00:04:25.640> Kombat<00:04:26.090> town<00:04:26.360> than<00:04:26.870> street

more of a Mortal Kombat town than street

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.840 
more of a Mortal Kombat town than street
fighter<00:04:27.440> because<00:04:27.710> Street<00:04:28.400> Fighter<00:04:28.610> was

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
fighter because Street Fighter was

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.970 
fighter because Street Fighter was
really<00:04:29.270> huge<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.810> then<00:04:30.050> once<00:04:30.260> Mortal<00:04:30.590> Kombat
