what i see in the wide angle setting you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
what i see in the wide angle setting you
know<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> compare<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.299> camera

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
know when you compare that to camera

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.080 
know when you compare that to camera
phones<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.040> 1<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
phones you really have a 1 times when it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.020 
phones you really have a 1 times when it
really<00:01:12.360> does<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.810> zoom<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.430> while

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
really does not zoom at all and while

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.090 
really does not zoom at all and while
I'm<00:01:15.180> holding<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.840> phone<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.860> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
I'm holding up this phone we have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.789 
I'm holding up this phone we have
cameras<00:01:17.790> Fuji<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.080> around<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> same

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
cameras Fuji that are around the same

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.859 
cameras Fuji that are around the same
size<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:20.729> with<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> 10<00:01:21.240> x<00:01:21.540> zoom

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
size of this one now with a 10 x zoom

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.710 
size of this one now with a 10 x zoom
lens<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.549> zoom<00:01:23.549> lenses<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> closer<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
lens so zoom lenses get you closer to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
lens so zoom lenses get you closer to
the<00:01:24.810> action<00:01:25.170> end<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.590> story<00:01:25.770> number<00:01:26.159> 7

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the action end of story number 7

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
the action end of story number 7
kamenashi<00:01:27.360> better<00:01:27.689> low-light<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.409> what's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
kamenashi better low-light and what's

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.410 
kamenashi better low-light and what's
the<00:01:28.710> biggest<00:01:28.979> reason<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the biggest reason for that good well of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
the biggest reason for that good well of
course<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> sensor<00:01:31.229> size<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> digital

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
course the sensor size on a digital

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240 
course the sensor size on a digital
camera<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.210> larger<00:01:33.540> than<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.590> sensor<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
camera is much larger than a sensor that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
camera is much larger than a sensor that
would<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.640> built<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> camera<00:01:36.600> phone<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
would be built into a camera phone and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.380 
would be built into a camera phone and
the<00:01:37.110> larger<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> sensor<00:01:38.130> size<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.119> more

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the larger the sensor size is the more

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
the larger the sensor size is the more
easy<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.890> camera<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.490> collect<00:01:41.880> light<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
easy the camera can collect light and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.819 
easy the camera can collect light and
therefore<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.049> take<00:01:43.290> better<00:01:43.530> pictures

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
therefore you can take better pictures

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.600 
therefore you can take better pictures
in<00:01:44.100> low<00:01:44.340> light<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:44.899> in<00:01:45.899> no<00:01:46.259> light<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:47.399> in

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in low light or in no light or that's in

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.789 
in low light or in no light or that's in
at<00:01:47.880> high<00:01:48.180> iso<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.930> low<00:01:49.140> noise<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> look<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
at high iso with low noise you look a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.700 
at high iso with low noise you look a
lot<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.100> images<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.549> cell<00:01:51.180> phone<00:01:51.710> californie

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
lot of images from cell phone californie

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.340 
lot of images from cell phone californie
so<00:01:53.310> noisy<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:53.939> grainy<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> blurry<00:01:54.630> because

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so noisy and grainy and blurry because

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.679 
so noisy and grainy and blurry because
people<00:01:56.250> try<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.490> take<00:01:56.700> pictures<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> low

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
people try and take pictures in a low

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.209 
people try and take pictures in a low
light<00:01:57.869> situation<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.530> doesn't<00:01:58.649> work<00:01:58.920> so

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
light situation just doesn't work so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.899 
light situation just doesn't work so
number<00:02:00.030> 6<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.979> really<00:02:02.310> built<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
number 6 this is really built as a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.850 
number 6 this is really built as a
camera<00:02:03.509> from<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.810> ground<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
camera from the ground up it's not a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.800 
camera from the ground up it's not a
phone<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.729> built<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.270> they<00:02:06.450> built<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
phone that was built that they built a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
phone that was built that they built a
camera<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:07.979> advantages<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.700> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
camera into so what advantages do I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.190 
camera into so what advantages do I
guess<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> functionalities<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200
