00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everybody then the video today is a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.440
 tutorial had yet another step by step 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.469
 how do i do my super home 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.349
 simple first step i apply one 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.780
 Cuticle pad by my fingernail 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.820
 whole so it moisturizes and helps 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.609
 people to remove the cuticle much more 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.880
 easy and pain-free 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 After a few minutes I take it all back. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.289
 the excess of that cream and with the help of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.820
 A spatula pushed the entire cuticle and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.820
 then comes the qualitative 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.100
 now with the help of a sandpaper block the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.560
 which is very good especially for whom 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.009
 has the nail a little on the side with 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.500
 depth variations we are going to 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.110
 so nail is wonderful garbage and I 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.940
 I always like to leave her a little 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.570
 the nail surface because it 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.030
 lisinha takes all that season online 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.409
 Who's up is wonderful and Diego 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.899
 enough for you 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.090
 then the wind a common list even just 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.590
 hitting the tip of her leaving her 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.590
 well square the way I like it 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.710
 now I 'll come again with that 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.660
 cream that I even use for mullet 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.400
 cuticle and will pass across the line 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.890
 new that is to take all that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.500
 residue of dust that is garbage left and fall 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.300
 to moisturize the nail even after I saw 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.430
 I 'm going to get the excess cream out like this 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.400
 As you did the first time I'll come with 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.920
 this block list again but this is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.590
 one that has four sides and one it gives 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.410
 glow another washes the lyon line and everything 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.870
 But this sandpaper is wonderful and you do not have 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.820
 at home need to have one she gives a shine 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.490
 incredible nail I do not know if you're going 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.800
 get a lot of attention on the video but she 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.320
 gives an absurd glow on the nail I think 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.470
 You 'll see if you stay. 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.090

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.090

 and now to finalize and prepare our 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.250

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.730
 after our fingernail all ready full 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.830
 Pretty moisturized I came with this 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.400
 realsec glaze is wonderful o 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:28.400

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.830
 I'm going to pass only one layer of him and he 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.180
 It will look super bright like you 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.330

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.790

 perfumes and it's super cheap 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.160
 at least here in the store where the work 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.610
 It's 21 25 and it's a more beautiful thing than 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.770

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.930

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.180

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.960
 I will teach you , and now with the 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.090
 help you with those 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.420
 against any perfumery is super 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.220
 there are around 34 reais and 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.980
 try all colors 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.320
 so I'm going to cut them in what you had 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.540
 very little ones they are stickers 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.450
 and I play with creativity is that 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.500
 I did three types of nails for you both. 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.650
 you have a notion even as you give 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.770
 play and abuse these sites and stay 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.650
 cool effect then you can 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.590
 to make a fingernail in a unique way 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.130
 and anyway you choose and he looks good 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:50.780
 very good colleague as you can 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.640
 see that it's super easy to take off and 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.800
 then it's just you make sure he 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.320
 will be well glued is prohibited to the team 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.419
 black we're going to go over not 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.760
 leak and ruin all our design 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.890
 black enamel I'm wearing is black 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.250
 jade jack is also a very brand 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.650
 Good, I recommend it a lot and now 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.040
 I'll just go over these 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.740
 ribbons and then with the help of pliers 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.470
 even if I used it I'll remove the 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.450
 Ribbons soon after you can withdraw 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:24.289
 with finger too I got a little 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:26.240
 afraid to like my finger in the nail polish 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.940
 it ends up staining so I used 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.040
 O 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.230
 but this goes from the practice that you 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.230
 You use what's best for you. 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.780
 and this is the result I do not expect 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.500
 You liked kisses and even the 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.500
