their<00:00:19.840> hundred<00:00:20.350> watt<00:00:21.210> solar<00:00:22.210> charge

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
their hundred watt solar charge

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.750 
their hundred watt solar charge
controllers<00:00:23.650> so<00:00:23.890> I<00:00:23.920> bought<00:00:24.190> both<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.610> them

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
controllers so I bought both of them

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.960 
controllers so I bought both of them
about<00:00:25.600> a<00:00:25.660> year<00:00:26.110> and<00:00:26.260> a<00:00:26.320> half<00:00:26.590> ago<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.340> we're

Springs in Colorado and yeah I love this
solar<00:00:34.750> panel<00:00:34.899> but<00:00:35.350> I'm<00:00:35.410> going<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.620> kind<00:00:35.800> of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
solar panel but I'm going to kind of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.110 
solar panel but I'm going to kind of
show<00:00:36.070> you<00:00:36.160> guys<00:00:36.250> a<00:00:36.370> little<00:00:36.520> bit<00:00:36.730> about<00:00:36.940> the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
general overview about it all right so

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.000 
general overview about it all right so
right<00:00:40.359> now<00:00:40.569> we<00:00:40.629> have<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:41.079> solar<00:00:41.350> panel<00:00:41.829> and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
right now we have the solar panel and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.419 
right now we have the solar panel and
direct<00:00:42.489> sunlight<00:00:42.879> and<00:00:43.679> it's<00:00:44.679> really<00:00:45.069> great

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
direct sunlight and it's really great

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.509 
direct sunlight and it's really great
because<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:46.089> can<00:00:46.300> adjust<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.989> angle<00:00:47.249> here<00:00:48.249> on

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
because you can adjust the angle here on

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.880 
because you can adjust the angle here on
the<00:00:48.670> back<00:00:48.940> with<00:00:49.929> these<00:00:50.079> little<00:00:50.260> guys<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.559> are

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
the back with these little guys that are

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.259 
the back with these little guys that are
built<00:00:51.159> in<00:00:51.399> and<00:00:51.579> then<00:00:51.699> when<00:00:51.879> you're<00:00:51.999> going<00:00:52.149> to

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
built in and then when you're going to

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.469 
built in and then when you're going to
store<00:00:52.510> they<00:00:52.749> just<00:00:52.960> fold<00:00:53.199> up<00:00:53.519> but<00:00:54.519> anyhow<00:00:55.269> it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
store they just fold up but anyhow it

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.079 
store they just fold up but anyhow it
will<00:00:55.659> give<00:00:55.839> you<00:00:55.929> directions<00:00:56.109> as<00:00:56.679> far<00:00:56.710> as<00:00:57.159> what

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
will give you directions as far as what

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.079 
will give you directions as far as what
time<00:00:58.329> of<00:00:58.479> year<00:00:58.899> you<00:00:59.379> should<00:00:59.440> have<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.879> angle

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
time of year you should have one angle

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.500 
time of year you should have one angle
and<00:01:01.449> whatnot<00:01:01.979> but<00:01:02.979> and<00:01:03.850> then<00:01:04.030> even<00:01:04.210> where

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
and whatnot but and then even where

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.840 
and whatnot but and then even where
you're<00:01:04.720> located<00:01:05.049> in<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.740> US<00:01:06.070> will<00:01:06.400> tell<00:01:06.640> you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
you're located in the US will tell you

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090 
you're located in the US will tell you
what<00:01:07.570> angle<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.110> should<00:01:08.320> have<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.650> set<00:01:08.920> at

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
what angle you should have it set at

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.240 
what angle you should have it set at
based<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.850> what<00:01:10.000> time<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.240> year<00:01:11.070> there's<00:01:12.070> also

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
based on what time of year there's also

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.779 
based on what time of year there's also
a<00:01:12.399> 12<00:01:12.700> volt<00:01:12.969> and<00:01:13.090> 24<00:01:13.180> volt<00:01:14.280> setting<00:01:15.280> on<00:01:15.460> here

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
a 12 volt and 24 volt setting on here

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.510 
a 12 volt and 24 volt setting on here
and<00:01:15.939> then<00:01:16.539> this<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.990> where<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.350> wrap<00:01:17.619> up<00:01:17.649> the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
and then this is where you wrap up the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.240 
and then this is where you wrap up the
wire<00:01:18.820> this<00:01:19.750> has<00:01:20.140> I<00:01:20.469> would<00:01:20.829> guess<00:01:21.219> probably

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
wire this has I would guess probably

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.240 
wire this has I would guess probably
about<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.729> 10<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.270> 12-foot<00:01:22.659> wire<00:01:23.219> which<00:01:24.219> is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
about a 10 to 12-foot wire which is

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.520 
about a 10 to 12-foot wire which is
really<00:01:24.759> nice<00:01:24.969> because<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.049> can<00:01:26.079> move<00:01:26.409> it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
really nice because you can move it

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.219 
really nice because you can move it
around<00:01:26.619> your<00:01:27.070> camper<00:01:27.490> whatever<00:01:27.820> you're<00:01:28.060> using

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
around your camper whatever you're using

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.249 
around your camper whatever you're using
make<00:01:29.229> sure<00:01:29.409> that's<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.950> is<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.960> direct

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
make sure that's in is the direct

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.830 
make sure that's in is the direct
sunlight<00:01:32.619> as<00:01:32.950> much<00:01:33.159> as<00:01:33.369> possible<00:01:33.810> which<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
sunlight as much as possible which is

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.310 
sunlight as much as possible which is
really<00:01:35.439> nice<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.820> pretty<00:01:37.060> lightweight<00:01:37.329> it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
really nice it's pretty lightweight it

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.640 
really nice it's pretty lightweight it
folds<00:01:38.679> up<00:01:38.770> real<00:01:39.039> nicely<00:01:39.369> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
folds up real nicely and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.820 
folds up real nicely and
it<00:01:41.580> seems<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.240> though<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.510> has<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.720> magnet<00:01:43.590> on

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
it seems as though it has a magnet on

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.670 
it seems as though it has a magnet on
the<00:01:44.210> outside<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> fold<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.440> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the outside so when you fold it up it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.710 
the outside so when you fold it up it
stays<00:01:47.070> shut

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
stays shut

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.610 
stays shut
real<00:01:48.720> nicely<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:51.450> then<00:01:51.660> with<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.110> solar

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
real nicely so and then with the solar

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.920 
real nicely so and then with the solar
panel<00:01:53.010> charge<00:01:53.280> controller<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.300> also<00:01:54.510> get

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
panel charge controller you also get

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.860 
panel charge controller you also get
these<00:01:55.110> other<00:01:55.320> plugins<00:01:55.980> as<00:01:56.640> well<00:01:56.700> too<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.390> this

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
these other plugins as well too so this

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.650 
these other plugins as well too so this
is<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.210> Harbor

everything and then here's like another
little<00:02:09.929> charger<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.590> believe<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.130> haven't

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
little charger I believe I haven't

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.390 
little charger I believe I haven't
really<00:02:11.730> used<00:02:11.760> any<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.740> usually<00:02:13.740> I'll

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
really used any of these usually I'll

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.120 
really used any of these usually I'll
just<00:02:14.760> hook<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.840> solar<00:02:16.410> panel<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.010> my

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
just hook up the solar panel to my

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.520 
just hook up the solar panel to my
battery<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:17.940> my<00:02:18.060> camper<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.780> then<00:02:19.380> I'll

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
battery here on my camper and then I'll

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.730 
battery here on my camper and then I'll
run<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> power<00:02:20.340> inverter<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.350> want<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
run like a power inverter if I want to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.720 
run like a power inverter if I want to
run<00:02:23.430> anything<00:02:24.380> while<00:02:25.380> I'm<00:02:25.560> one<00:02:26.040> boom<00:02:26.310> docking

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
run anything while I'm one boom docking

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
run anything while I'm one boom docking
or<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.750> alright<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:29.130> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
or one that so alright so with the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.970 
or one that so alright so with the
charge<00:02:29.940> controller<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:31.170> there's<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.800> couple

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
charge controller here there's a couple

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.100 
charge controller here there's a couple
different<00:02:32.100> plugins<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.270> um

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
different plugins so um

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.670 
different plugins so um
carol<00:02:34.950> has<00:02:35.070> seen<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:36.050> there's<00:02:37.050> one<00:02:37.350> plug

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
carol has seen this but there's one plug

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.310 
carol has seen this but there's one plug
that<00:02:37.890> obviously<00:02:38.190> goes<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.580> battery<00:02:39.320> with

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
that obviously goes to the battery with

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.400 
that obviously goes to the battery with
the<00:02:40.709> solar<00:02:40.980> charge<00:02:41.660> controller<00:02:42.660> or<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.170> solar

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
the solar charge controller or the solar

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.330 
the solar charge controller or the solar
panel<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.770> can't<00:02:44.010> remember

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
panel I can't remember

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.580 
panel I can't remember
you<00:02:44.670> do<00:02:44.790> get<00:02:44.940> alligator<00:02:45.480> clips<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.320> come

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
you do get alligator clips that come

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.490 
you do get alligator clips that come
with<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.130> anyways<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.880> one<00:02:48.690> goes<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
with it but anyways so one goes to the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.440 
with it but anyways so one goes to the
battery<00:02:49.890> one<00:02:50.370> obviously<00:02:50.760> goes<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.180> solar

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
battery one obviously goes to solar

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
battery one obviously goes to solar
panel<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.380> there's<00:02:52.620> another<00:02:52.769> place<00:02:53.310> for

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
panel and then there's another place for

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.479 
panel and then there's another place for
a<00:02:54.000> load<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.720> those<00:02:55.170> accessories<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:56.010> showed<00:02:56.310> you

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
a load so those accessories I showed you

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.540 
a load so those accessories I showed you
guys<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:57.810> could<00:02:58.080> plug<00:02:58.410> those<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
guys you could plug those in so if you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.880 
guys you could plug those in so if you
want<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.970> plug<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.660> like<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.019> 12<00:03:01.290> volt<00:03:01.560> socket

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
want to plug in like the 12 volt socket

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.120 
want to plug in like the 12 volt socket
you<00:03:02.730> could<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.540> use<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.950> said

you could do that and use that like said
I<00:03:05.160> don't<00:03:05.370> normally<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.120> just<00:03:06.480> run<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
I don't normally do that I just run a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.259 
I don't normally do that I just run a
power<00:03:06.930> inverter<00:03:07.140> inside<00:03:07.830> my<00:03:08.040> camper<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.730> then

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
power inverter inside my camper and then

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.990 
power inverter inside my camper and then
do<00:03:09.510> whatever<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.900> want<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.590> there<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.610> also<00:03:11.700> has

these three indicator lights as far as

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.920 
these three indicator lights as far as
if<00:03:13.920> it's<00:03:14.070> charging<00:03:14.489> throughout<00:03:15.239> low<00:03:15.420> voltage

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
if it's charging throughout low voltage

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.610 
if it's charging throughout low voltage
or<00:03:16.200> high<00:03:16.440> voltage<00:03:17.060> personally<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:18.239> use<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
or high voltage personally I just use a

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.990 
or high voltage personally I just use a
multimeter<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:21.150> monitor<00:03:22.130> what<00:03:23.130> my<00:03:23.280> voltage<00:03:23.760> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
multimeter to monitor what my voltage is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.930

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
about 12 point 7 volts with the solar

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.600 
about 12 point 7 volts with the solar
panel<00:04:12.959> we<00:04:13.470> get<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> different<00:04:14.099> battery<00:04:14.489> on

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
panel we get a different battery on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.670 
panel we get a different battery on
another<00:04:14.819> camper<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.420> we<00:04:15.540> had<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.320> one<00:04:16.530> got

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
another camper that we had that one got

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.039 
another camper that we had that one got
all<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> way<00:04:17.190> up<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.459> 3<00:04:17.850> point<00:04:18.419> through<00:04:18.840> Earth

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
all the way up to 3 point through Earth

all the way up to 3 point through Earth
I'm<00:04:19.320> sorry<00:04:19.590> thirteen<00:04:20.310> point<00:04:20.669> three<00:04:20.760> volts<00:04:21.560> so

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
I'm sorry thirteen point three volts so

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.719 
I'm sorry thirteen point three volts so
I<00:04:22.590> don't<00:04:22.740> know<00:04:22.800> what<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.100> reasoning<00:04:23.580> is

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
I don't know what the reasoning is

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.540 
I don't know what the reasoning is
behind<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.540> but<00:04:25.380> anyways<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.130> does<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> great

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
behind that but anyways it does a great

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.200 
behind that but anyways it does a great
job<00:04:26.669> at<00:04:27.210> maintaining<00:04:27.990> your<00:04:28.680> charge<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.610> if

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
job at maintaining your charge and if

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.420 
job at maintaining your charge and if
you're<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.440> run<00:04:31.650> stuff<00:04:31.950> during<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.490> day

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
you're you can run stuff during the day

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.460 
you're you can run stuff during the day
again<00:04:35.430> you're<00:04:35.729> either<00:04:35.940> off<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.510> here<00:04:37.080> if<00:04:37.350> you

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
again you're either off of here if you

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.260 
again you're either off of here if you
run<00:04:37.650> an<00:04:37.740> inverter<00:04:38.010> inside<00:04:38.580> as<00:04:38.790> long<00:04:38.970> as<00:04:39.150> the
