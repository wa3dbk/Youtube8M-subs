00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.690 
know we really like that drama that
happens<00:02:35.810> when<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.140> close<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:36.980> down<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.580> let

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
happens when you close it down and let

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.440 
happens when you close it down and let
it<00:02:37.730> set<00:02:38.030> up<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.450> then<00:02:38.930> go<00:02:39.110> in<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:41.120> that's<00:02:41.299> what

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
it set up and then go in now that's what

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.309 
it set up and then go in now that's what
I<00:02:41.480> call<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.810> setup

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.899 

and<00:02:44.620> you're<00:02:44.829> doing<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.069> song<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.579> it<00:02:45.760> has

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
and you're doing a song like this it has

00:02:45.909 --> 00:03:16.490 
and you're doing a song like this it has
a<00:02:45.939> lot<00:02:46.209> of<00:02:46.239> mood<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.780> it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.200 

right<00:03:17.500> there<00:03:17.710> I'm<00:03:17.800> using<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.130> harmonica<00:03:18.790> to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
right there I'm using a harmonica to

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.230 
right there I'm using a harmonica to
kind<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.570> mark<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.020> minor<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.820> do<00:03:21.820> in<00:03:22.030> such<00:03:22.210> a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
kind of mark that a minor I do in such a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.210 
kind of mark that a minor I do in such a
way<00:03:22.510> where<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.750> rake<00:03:23.230> my<00:03:23.530> fingers<00:03:23.950> that's

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
way where I rake my fingers that's

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.550 
way where I rake my fingers that's
another<00:03:24.520> technique<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.570> think<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
another technique that I think in the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.210 
another technique that I think in the
blues<00:03:26.800> is<00:03:27.010> really<00:03:27.310> effective<00:03:28.620> now<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.680> you've

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
blues is really effective now you you've

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.380 
blues is really effective now you you've
heard<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.520> done<00:03:30.700> probably<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.240> lot<00:03:31.360> of

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
heard it done probably a lot of

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.180 
heard it done probably a lot of
different<00:03:31.720> ways<00:03:31.900> one<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.470> ways<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.890> gets

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
different ways one of the ways this gets

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.190 
different ways one of the ways this gets
done<00:03:33.400> also<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.940> I'm<00:03:34.030> I'm<00:03:34.540> gonna<00:03:34.750> stay<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.020> a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
done also and I'm I'm gonna stay in a

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.770 
done also and I'm I'm gonna stay in a
minor<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:35.650> this<00:03:35.800> was<00:03:36.460> when<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.820> kind<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.210> do

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
minor for this was when you kind of do

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.020 
minor for this was when you kind of do
what<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:37.990> call<00:03:38.230> an<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.560> choose<00:03:38.890> stroke<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.580> we've

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
what I call an I choose stroke and we've

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.460 
what I call an I choose stroke and we've
touched<00:03:40.210> on<00:03:40.450> this<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.630> little<00:03:40.870> bit<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.230> couple

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
touched on this a little bit of a couple

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:52.030 
touched on this a little bit of a couple
of<00:03:41.500> my<00:03:41.620> acoustic<00:03:41.980> things

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:01.300 

as<00:03:53.040> more<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.430> shuffle

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.100 

so<00:04:01.910> that's<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.240> that's<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.480> technique<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.959> can

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
so that's it that's a technique you can

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.100 
so that's it that's a technique you can
utilize<00:04:03.290> in<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.400> song<00:04:04.640> like<00:04:04.850> this<00:04:04.930> where<00:04:05.930> you've

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
utilize in a song like this where you've

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.840 
utilize in a song like this where you've
got<00:04:06.319> to<00:04:06.590> get<00:04:06.709> your<00:04:06.890> open<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.250> string<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.760> you

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
got to get your open a string and you

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.670 
got to get your open a string and you
want<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.209> get<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.720> little<00:04:08.900> bit<00:04:09.050> aggressive<00:04:09.260> with

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
want to get a little bit aggressive with

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.270 
want to get a little bit aggressive with
it

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.150 

and<00:04:17.280> then<00:04:17.430> again

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.890 

I'm<00:04:22.820> gonna<00:04:22.940> take<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.210> apart<00:04:23.510> for<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.780> cuz

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
I'm gonna take that apart for you cuz

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.700 
I'm gonna take that apart for you cuz
that's<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.230> might<00:04:24.470> be<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.620> little

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
that's and that might be a little

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.650 
that's and that might be a little
deceiving<00:04:25.040> what<00:04:25.790> I'm<00:04:25.910> doing<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.210> I'm<00:04:26.330> coming

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
deceiving what I'm doing is I'm coming

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.570 
deceiving what I'm doing is I'm coming
down<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.050> I'm<00:04:27.110> raking<00:04:27.440> across<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:28.280> strings

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
down and I'm raking across the strings

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.730 
down and I'm raking across the strings
like<00:04:29.330> this<00:04:29.540> once<00:04:29.780> again<00:04:29.930> is<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.260> flamenco

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
like this once again is that flamenco

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.730 
like this once again is that flamenco
stroke<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:34.010> almost<00:04:34.250> like<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.550> flamenco

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
stroke it's almost like the flamenco

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.660 
stroke it's almost like the flamenco
incorporated<00:04:36.740> into<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.040> acoustic<00:04:37.520> blues

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
incorporated into the acoustic blues

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
incorporated into the acoustic blues
which<00:04:38.000> I<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.420> I<00:04:39.910> use<00:04:40.910> that<00:04:41.090> percussive

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
which I like I use that percussive

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.600 
which I like I use that percussive
nature<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.680> fingers<00:04:43.100> against<00:04:43.460> the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
nature of the fingers against the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.370 
nature of the fingers against the
strings<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.090> lot<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:47.210> in<00:04:47.450> slow<00:04:47.780> motion<00:04:48.020> as<00:04:48.350> you

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
strings a lot so in slow motion as you

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.920 
strings a lot so in slow motion as you
can<00:04:48.590> see<00:04:48.770> that's
