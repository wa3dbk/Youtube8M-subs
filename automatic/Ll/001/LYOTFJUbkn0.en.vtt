have to go the challenge is to get an
8-foot<00:00:18.390> robot<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.320> cross<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> Atlantic<00:00:20.160> it's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
8-foot robot to cross the Atlantic it's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.040 
8-foot robot to cross the Atlantic it's
a<00:00:20.640> groundbreaking<00:00:21.060> mission<00:00:21.630> that's<00:00:21.750> giving

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
a groundbreaking mission that's giving

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.670 
a groundbreaking mission that's giving
us<00:00:22.140> data<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.680> haven't<00:00:23.039> had<00:00:23.189> before<00:00:24.680> this

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
us data that we haven't had before this

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.250 
us data that we haven't had before this
data<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.160> critical<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.000> understand<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
data is critical to understand how the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
data is critical to understand how the
ocean<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.010> an<00:00:29.099> impact<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.580> climate<00:00:29.970> change<00:00:30.000> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
ocean is an impact in climate change so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.089 
ocean is an impact in climate change so
we<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> understand<00:00:31.410> what's<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:31.949> in

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
we have to understand what's going on in

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.440 
we have to understand what's going on in
the<00:00:32.160> ocean<00:00:32.520> because<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.820> regulates<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the ocean because it regulates the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.330 
the ocean because it regulates the
climate<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> understand<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> ocean<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
climate and understand the ocean if you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.950 
climate and understand the ocean if you
have<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> sample<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.480> only<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:36.809> we're

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
have to sample it the only way we're

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.350 
have to sample it the only way we're
gonna<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.950> robots<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
gonna do that is with robots there is a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
gonna do that is with robots there is a
big<00:00:39.629> urgency<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.290> order<00:00:40.620> race<00:00:40.800> against<00:00:41.219> time

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
big urgency here order race against time

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
big urgency here order race against time
because<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> oceans<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.450> changing<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.899> our

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
because the oceans are changing in our

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
because the oceans are changing in our
lifetime<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.730> major<00:00:44.730> changes<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> ocean

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
lifetime and major changes in the ocean

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.529 
lifetime and major changes in the ocean
have<00:00:46.200> always<00:00:46.559> resulted<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.340> major<00:00:48.000> changes<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
life on us the odds are very slim that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.369 
life on us the odds are very slim that
we're<00:00:51.360> actually<00:00:51.510> gonna<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.140> vehicle

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
we're actually gonna get this vehicle

we're actually gonna get this vehicle
across<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.360> something<00:00:54.870> that's

clocks that were racing against one is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.029 
clocks that were racing against one is
that<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:02.929> have<00:02:03.049> our<00:02:03.079> hurricane<00:02:03.590> heading<00:02:03.890> our

that we have our hurricane heading our

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.160 
that we have our hurricane heading our
way<00:02:04.069> so<00:02:04.579> here's<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.969> hurricane<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.960> here's

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
way so here's the hurricane and here's

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.899 
way so here's the hurricane and here's
the<00:02:06.350> Azores<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.039> south<00:02:07.280> where<00:02:07.729> their

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
as we can but right now the gliders not
