00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.980 
major player but I think a lot of this
was<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:48.669> was<00:04:48.729> Lee's<00:04:49.449> jungling<00:04:50.169> style<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.009> then

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
was it was Lee's jungling style and then

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.869 
was it was Lee's jungling style and then

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
that when that champion was picked they

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.420 
that when that champion was picked they

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
they were going to have it if they

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.730 
they were going to have it if they
didn't<00:05:04.569> Lane<00:05:04.689> swap<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.139> that<00:05:05.229> was<00:05:05.319> the

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
didn't Lane swap and that was the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.100 
didn't Lane swap and that was the
decision<00:05:06.129> that<00:05:06.159> they<00:05:06.370> made<00:05:06.580> really<00:05:07.539> didn't

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
decision that they made really didn't

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.510

work out for them yep so one of the
tricks<00:05:12.789> is<00:05:12.969> GE<00:05:13.270> have<00:05:13.599> up<00:05:13.779> their<00:05:13.930> sleeve<00:05:14.229> here

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
tricks is GE have up their sleeve here

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.850

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.709 
even their strongest roster in
very<00:05:23.860> interesting<00:05:24.370> but<00:05:24.879> they<00:05:25.240> can<00:05:25.389> make<00:05:25.539> some

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
very interesting but they can make some

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:27.149 
very interesting but they can make some
good<00:05:25.840> annotations<00:05:26.469> here<00:05:26.650> there<00:05:26.860> I'm<00:05:27.009> not

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
good annotations here there I'm not

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.739 
good annotations here there I'm not
concerned<00:05:27.550> about<00:05:27.699> their<00:05:27.999> team<00:05:28.210> I<00:05:28.360> think<00:05:28.599> I

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:28.749 
concerned about their team I think I

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:30.929 
concerned about their team I think I
think<00:05:28.990> GE<00:05:29.169> has<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.740> pick<00:05:29.949> for<00:05:30.520> some<00:05:30.669> really

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:30.939 
think GE has the pick for some really

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.999 
think GE has the pick for some really
dominant<00:05:31.360> lanes<00:05:31.629> in<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:31.990> game<00:05:32.199> tryin<00:05:32.800> just

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
dominant lanes in this game tryin just

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.189 
dominant lanes in this game tryin just
survive<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.639> early<00:05:33.909> game<00:05:34.090> and<00:05:34.509> let<00:05:34.779> their

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
survive that early game and let their

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.649 
survive that early game and let their
strengths<00:05:35.680> shine<00:05:35.979> through<00:05:36.430> at<00:05:37.090> the<00:05:37.300> cost<00:05:37.509> of

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
strengths shine through at the cost of

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.140 
strengths shine through at the cost of
maybe<00:05:37.840> some<00:05:38.080> late-game<00:05:38.729> champion<00:05:39.729> selection

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
maybe some late-game champion selection

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.420 
maybe some late-game champion selection
because<00:05:40.749> you'll<00:05:41.349> have<00:05:41.499> at<00:05:41.680> least<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.979> lead<00:05:42.189> to

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
because you'll have at least a lead to

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.920 
because you'll have at least a lead to
play<00:05:42.610> with<00:05:42.819> that<00:05:43.060> point<00:05:43.360> that's<00:05:43.629> right<00:05:43.810> well

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
play with that point that's right well

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.029 
play with that point that's right well
