I<00:00:55.750> think<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.890> key<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.129> man<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:57.640> gotta<00:00:57.820> have

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
I think the key is man you gotta have

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.709 
I think the key is man you gotta have
guys<00:00:58.410> who<00:00:59.410> can<00:00:59.590> spread<00:00:59.829> the<00:01:00.010> floor<00:01:00.250> and<00:01:00.719> you

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
guys who can spread the floor and you

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.420 
guys who can spread the floor and you
know<00:01:01.809> knock<00:01:02.079> down<00:01:02.289> shots<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.949> I<00:01:03.070> think<00:01:03.280> that's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
know knock down shots and I think that's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.460 
know knock down shots and I think that's
not<00:01:03.579> main<00:01:03.820> thing<00:01:04.059> if<00:01:04.540> we<00:01:04.720> get<00:01:04.870> guys<00:01:05.050> on<00:01:05.110> the
