00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.970 

we're<00:02:20.510> still<00:02:20.780> gonna<00:02:21.050> want<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.440> move<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
then I ride regular stance usually 16

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.730 
then I ride regular stance usually 16
negative<00:02:44.780> 12<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:46.430> that's<00:02:47.240> I'm<00:02:48.140> just<00:02:48.470> going<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
negative 12 so that's I'm just going to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.990 
negative 12 so that's I'm just going to
set<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.160> at<00:02:49.430> 1692<00:02:50.360> 12<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:54.760> i'm<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:55.910> to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
set it up at 1692 12 so and i'm going to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.290 
set it up at 1692 12 so and i'm going to
set<00:02:56.210> it<00:02:56.240> up<00:02:56.450> at<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.960> reference<00:02:57.530> point<00:02:58.300> so

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
set it up at the reference point so

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.480 
set it up at the reference point so
first<00:02:59.740> we're<00:03:00.740> going<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.980> see<00:03:01.100> this<00:03:01.280> arrow<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
first we're going to see this arrow and

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.060 
first we're going to see this arrow and
line<00:03:04.490> it<00:03:04.520> up<00:03:04.820> at<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.360> reference<00:03:05.870> point<00:03:06.500> right

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
line it up at the reference point right

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.800 
line it up at the reference point right
there<00:03:08.440> then<00:03:09.880> we're<00:03:10.880> going<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.120> see<00:03:11.330> in<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
there then we're going to see in the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.880 
there then we're going to see in the
middle<00:03:12.230> right<00:03:12.410> there<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.310> red<00:03:13.790> line<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:14.890> want

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
middle right there the red line and want

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.040 
middle right there the red line and want
to<00:03:16.010> line<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.220> up<00:03:16.550> at<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.030> red<00:03:17.180> line<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
to line it up at the red line so the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.930 
to line it up at the red line so the
battle<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.560> at<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.070> middle<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.760> board

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
battle is at the middle of the board

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.410 
battle is at the middle of the board
there<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.260> then<00:03:24.260> set<00:03:24.800> it<00:03:24.830> up<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.310> negative<00:03:25.580> 12

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
there and then set it up to negative 12

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.340 
there and then set it up to negative 12
just<00:03:27.020> turn<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:27.320> around<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.490> that<00:03:28.730> it's

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
just turn it around to see that it's

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.910 
just turn it around to see that it's
negative<00:03:30.350> 12<00:03:30.890> right<00:03:31.280> there<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:33.230> then<00:03:33.380> move<00:03:33.740> it

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
negative 12 right there and then move it

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.550 
negative 12 right there and then move it
back<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.430> reference<00:03:35.030> point<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:35.660> check<00:03:36.290> that

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
back to reference point and check that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.449 
back to reference point and check that
it's<00:03:36.800> only<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.370> red<00:03:37.580> man<00:03:37.850> OH<00:03:41.410> swings<00:03:42.459> password

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
it's only the red man OH swings password

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.540 
it's only the red man OH swings password
there<00:03:44.090> we<00:03:44.180> go<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.660> then<00:03:46.510> let's<00:03:47.510> go<00:03:48.250> you<00:03:49.250> type

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
there we go and then let's go you type

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.240 
there we go and then let's go you type
in<00:03:49.760> your<00:03:49.850> screws<00:03:50.180> just<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.290> little<00:03:51.709> bit<00:03:52.010> more
