mandibular midline well actually is
solid<00:00:13.320> now<00:00:13.349> now<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> think<00:00:13.920> about<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.219> were

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
solid now now I think about we were

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.560 
solid now now I think about we were
moving<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.910> right<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.150> open<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
moving it to the right just open a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.599 
moving it to the right just open a
little<00:00:15.780> bit<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.080> me<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.680> now<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.859> can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.220> we

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
little bit for me so now you can see we

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.830 
little bit for me so now you can see we
have<00:00:17.880> power<00:00:18.210> chain<00:00:18.920> from<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.210> molar<00:00:21.480> on

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
have power chain from the first molar on

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.080 
have power chain from the first molar on
the<00:00:21.960> left<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.920> molar<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.850> right

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the left the first molar on the right

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.970 
the left the first molar on the right
while<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.449> did<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.529> kind<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
while we did and this is kind of a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.089 
while we did and this is kind of a
learning<00:00:26.250> point<00:00:26.460> today<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.859> an

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
learning point today was that we have an

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
learning point today was that we have an
O<00:00:29.250> two<00:00:29.460> O<00:00:29.490> round<00:00:29.910> stainless<00:00:30.480> steel<00:00:30.660> wire<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
O two O round stainless steel wire and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.920 
O two O round stainless steel wire and
we<00:00:32.189> did<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.640> both<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.030> maxilla<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> mandible

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we did in both the maxilla and mandible

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
we did in both the maxilla and mandible
and<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.770> did<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> power<00:00:35.280> channel<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:36.149> molar

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and we did have power channel from molar

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.060 
and we did have power channel from molar
or<00:00:36.540> molar<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> mandible<00:00:37.820> however

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
or molar on the mandible however

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.119 
or molar on the mandible however
apparently<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.520> past<00:00:42.059> residence<00:00:43.129> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
apparently like past residence and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.660 
apparently like past residence and
placing<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.530> wire<00:00:46.530> into<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:46.980> head<00:00:47.219> gear<00:00:47.430> tube

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
placing the wire into the head gear tube

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.970 
placing the wire into the head gear tube
so<00:00:48.270> what's<00:00:48.809> happened<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> see

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so what's happened is that you can see

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.819 
so what's happened is that you can see
how<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.899> rotation<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
how we have this rotation and the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.220 
how we have this rotation and the
lingual<00:00:53.129> inclination<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.149> tooth<00:00:54.960> so

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
lingual inclination of this tooth so

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
lingual inclination of this tooth so
what<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.530> happening<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.699> every<00:00:57.120> time

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
what was happening is that every time

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.729 
what was happening is that every time
I've<00:00:57.420> replaced<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> wire<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.260> placing<00:00:58.620> into

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I've replaced the wire is placing into

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
I've replaced the wire is placing into
the<00:00:58.980> head<00:00:59.340> gear<00:00:59.579> tube<00:00:59.789> now<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> great

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the head gear tube now it's a great

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.529 
the head gear tube now it's a great
learning<00:01:00.750> experience<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.320> what's<00:01:01.770> even<00:01:01.859> more

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
learning experience but what's even more

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.399 
learning experience but what's even more
what's<00:01:03.539> even<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> better<00:01:04.019> learning<00:01:04.290> experience

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
what's even a better learning experience

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
what's even a better learning experience
is<00:01:04.799> how<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> correct<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.939> we're

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
is how to correct this so what we're

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
is how to correct this so what we're
going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.500> had<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.740> O<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:08.070> O

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
going to do now is we we had an O two O

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.140 
going to do now is we we had an O two O
stainless<00:01:08.640> steel<00:01:08.820> round<00:01:09.060> wire<00:01:09.439> and<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:12.000> an

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
stainless steel round wire and in an

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.730 
stainless steel round wire and in an
effort<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> regain<00:01:13.340> or<00:01:15.590> reposition<00:01:16.590> this

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
effort to regain or reposition this

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980 
effort to regain or reposition this
tooth<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.729> buckle<00:01:18.090> position<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.780> place

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
tooth more in a buckle position we place

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
tooth more in a buckle position we place
them<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> o2<00:01:20.340> Oro<00:01:20.700> although<00:01:21.540> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
them and because the o2 Oro although it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.450 
them and because the o2 Oro although it
will<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.049> nice<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.100> stainless

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
will go nice and here the stainless

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
will go nice and here the stainless
steel<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.729> won't<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:23.970> into<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> actual

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
steel it won't go into the actual

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.100 
steel it won't go into the actual
regular<00:01:25.140> tube<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.390> an<00:01:27.479> effort<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.810> do<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
regular tube so in an effort to do that

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
regular tube so in an effort to do that
we<00:01:28.350> placed<00:01:28.590> an<00:01:28.710> o1<00:01:28.890> eight<00:01:29.369> night<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:32.040> without

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
we placed an o1 eight night I to without

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.380 
we placed an o1 eight night I to without
the<00:01:32.880> power<00:01:33.180> chain<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.460> hopefully

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the power chain and that will hopefully

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.719 
the power chain and that will hopefully
put<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> more<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.530> buckle<00:01:37.890> position<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
put it more on a buckle position of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
put it more on a buckle position of
course<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.150> taking<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> consideration<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
course it taking a consideration to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.590 
course it taking a consideration to
patients<00:01:41.100> occlusion<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.909> well<00:01:42.119> despite

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
patients occlusion as well despite

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
patients occlusion as well despite
California

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
California

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.789 
California
and<00:01:45.520> yep<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.299> can't<00:01:46.570> maybe<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.320> can<00:01:47.500> see<00:01:47.680> it

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
and yep you can't maybe you can see it

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.380 
and yep you can't maybe you can see it
but<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.280> can<00:01:48.460> see<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.880> we<00:01:49.030> definitely<00:01:49.180> have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
but I can see it that we definitely have

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.240 
but I can see it that we definitely have
some<00:01:49.630> space<00:01:49.930> for<00:01:50.229> bucket<00:01:50.649> positioning<00:01:51.100> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
some space for bucket positioning that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.600 
some space for bucket positioning that
too

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
too

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.929 
too
so<00:01:52.240> another<00:01:52.600> month<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.079> we're<00:01:53.289> going<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.530> see

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so another month and we're going to see

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.800 
so another month and we're going to see
how<00:01:54.939> much<00:01:55.090> space

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
how much space
