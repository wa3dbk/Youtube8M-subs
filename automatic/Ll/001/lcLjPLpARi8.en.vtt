trap works is a bite or pull on the bait

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.350 
trap works is a bite or pull on the bait
if<00:01:05.470> you've<00:01:05.650> got<00:01:05.799> an<00:01:05.950> animal<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.760> maybe<00:01:07.150> is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
if you've got an animal that maybe is

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.749 
if you've got an animal that maybe is
hesitant<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.080> step<00:01:08.290> on<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.500> pan<00:01:08.799> you<00:01:09.399> could<00:01:09.579> also

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
hesitant to step on a pan you could also

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.389 
hesitant to step on a pan you could also
set<00:01:10.119> up<00:01:10.149> a<00:01:10.329> couple<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.750> traps<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.259> way<00:01:11.500> so

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
set up a couple of traps this way so

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.310 
set up a couple of traps this way so
that<00:01:12.549> there<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.880> no<00:01:13.180> pan<00:01:13.479> on<00:01:13.719> the<00:01:13.840> trap<00:01:14.079> they

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
that there is no pan on the trap they

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.980 
that there is no pan on the trap they
come<00:01:14.590> in<00:01:14.829> if<00:01:15.070> they<00:01:15.579> bite<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.149> bait<00:01:16.329> pull<00:01:16.810> on

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
come in if they bite on the bait pull on

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.249 
come in if they bite on the bait pull on
the<00:01:17.170> bait<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.939> tension<00:01:19.450> adjustable<00:01:20.079> so

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
the bait it is tension adjustable so

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.440 
the bait it is tension adjustable so
that<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.530> can<00:01:20.710> make<00:01:20.859> it<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:21.280> sensitive<00:01:22.000> that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
that you can make it so sensitive that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.020 
that you can make it so sensitive that
if<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.689> bird<00:01:22.930> pecked<00:01:23.439> on<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.890> bait<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.789> would

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
if a bird pecked on the bait it would

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.719 
if a bird pecked on the bait it would
fire<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.539> trap<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.380> also<00:01:26.680> back<00:01:27.100> off<00:01:27.399> on

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
fire the trap you can also back off on

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.969 
fire the trap you can also back off on
it<00:01:27.939> if<00:01:28.119> you're<00:01:28.509> trying<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.810> catch<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.109> raccoon<00:01:29.320> a

the trap on a hair-trigger these springs

trap every time again it's called the
posi<00:01:51.670> trigger<00:01:52.090> now<00:01:52.689> let's<00:01:52.869> take<00:01:53.079> a<00:01:53.109> kind<00:01:53.829> of<00:01:53.920> a

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
posi trigger now let's take a kind of a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.380 
posi trigger now let's take a kind of a
close-up<00:01:54.490> view<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:54.999> and<00:01:55.090> I'll<00:01:55.149> show<00:01:55.210> you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
close-up view of it and I'll show you

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.750 
close-up view of it and I'll show you
how<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.689> works

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.040 

so<00:02:00.760> I've<00:02:00.880> got<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.090> positive<00:02:01.330> trigger<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.900> my

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
so I've got a positive trigger in my

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.140 
so I've got a positive trigger in my
