00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.030 

we're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.730> take<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.910> quick<00:00:09.240> look<00:00:09.540> at

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
we're going to take a quick look at

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.580 
we're going to take a quick look at
launching<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.429> surf<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.349> the<00:00:13.349> first<00:00:13.500> thing

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
launching and surf and the first thing

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.680 
launching and surf and the first thing
we're<00:00:13.710> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> talk<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.759> ideal

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
we're going to talk about is the ideal

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.410 
we're going to talk about is the ideal
beach<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.350> launch<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.279> ideal<00:00:17.789> beach<00:00:18.090> for

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
beach to launch at the ideal beach for

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830 
beach to launch at the ideal beach for
launching<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.789> very<00:00:20.789> much<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.330> it's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
launching is very much like this it's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.340 
launching is very much like this it's
got<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> nice<00:00:22.320> gradual<00:00:23.630> slope<00:00:24.630> into<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> water

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
got a nice gradual slope into the water

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
got a nice gradual slope into the water
and<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.710> slope<00:00:26.010> continues<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> be<00:00:26.849> gradual

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and that slope continues to be gradual

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.560 
and that slope continues to be gradual
fairly<00:00:27.900> far<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:29.580> reason<00:00:29.849> that's<00:00:29.970> good<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
fairly far out the reason that's good is

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.020 
fairly far out the reason that's good is
it<00:00:31.500> means<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> waves<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> break

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
it means the waves are going to break

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.979 
it means the waves are going to break
gradually<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.230> come<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:35.809> slope<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
gradually as they come in if slope of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.740 
gradually as they come in if slope of
the<00:00:37.469> beach<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.860> too<00:00:38.129> steep<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.790> waves<00:00:39.480> will

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the beach is too steep the waves will

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
the beach is too steep the waves will
roll<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.260> hitch<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.280> last<00:00:41.489> second<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
roll in hitch up at the last second and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.319 
roll in hitch up at the last second and
dump<00:00:42.360> hard<00:00:43.219> that<00:00:44.219> makes<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> really<00:00:44.760> tough<00:00:45.149> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
dump hard that makes it really tough to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.720 
dump hard that makes it really tough to
get<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.719> keep<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.649> gear<00:00:46.890> organized<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.579> mean

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
get out keep your gear organized I mean

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.310 
get out keep your gear organized I mean
once<00:00:47.940> you're<00:00:48.059> once<00:00:48.780> you're<00:00:48.930> through<00:00:49.110> those

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
once you're once you're through those

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.500 
once you're once you're through those
first<00:00:49.500> few<00:00:49.710> waves<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> clear<00:00:50.940> but

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
first few waves you're in the clear but

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.380 
first few waves you're in the clear but
those<00:00:52.020> last<00:00:52.440> few<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.250> last<00:00:53.940> seconds<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
those last few the last seconds of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
those last few the last seconds of
Windows<00:00:54.719> waves<00:00:55.410> crash<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.280> really

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
Windows waves crash they can really

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.689 
Windows waves crash they can really
hammer<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.910> hard<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.489> beach

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
hammer you hard so even on this beach

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.250 
hammer you hard so even on this beach
right<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.180> you're<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.750> areas

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
right here you're going to have areas

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.759 
right here you're going to have areas
that<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.680> our<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.670> less<00:01:03.000> slope<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.769> more

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that are our have less slope and more

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.640 
that are our have less slope and more
slope<00:01:05.129> down<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> water<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> time

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
slope down to the water so take the time

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.370 
slope down to the water so take the time
be<00:01:08.280> patient<00:01:08.310> sit<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.119> shore<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> watch<00:01:10.110> and

be patient sit on shore and watch and
take<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> look<00:01:10.710> at<00:01:10.799> where<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.400> waves<00:01:11.580> are

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
take a look at where the waves are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.760 
take a look at where the waves are
coming<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.390> where<00:01:12.960> they're<00:01:13.140> coming<00:01:13.439> unite

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
coming in and where they're coming unite

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
coming in and where they're coming unite
and<00:01:14.100> smooth<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.810> rolling<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.140> where

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
their kitchen and dumping and avoid

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
their kitchen and dumping and avoid
those<00:01:20.369> spots<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.450> once<00:01:21.600> you've<00:01:21.750> chosen<00:01:21.960> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
those spots so once you've chosen your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.840 
those spots so once you've chosen your
spot<00:01:22.700> waves<00:01:23.700> come<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.180> sets<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.850> there's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
spot waves come in and sets and there's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
spot waves come in and sets and there's
the<00:01:27.150> lull<00:01:27.420> between<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:28.259> sets<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> really

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the lull between those sets is really

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.230 
the lull between those sets is really
when<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.070> want<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.520> off<00:01:29.729> unless<00:01:30.090> you're

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
when you want to take off unless you're

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.819 
when you want to take off unless you're
dealing<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.900> tiny<00:01:31.140> surf<00:01:31.500> where<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
dealing with really tiny surf where it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.969 
dealing with really tiny surf where it
doesn't<00:01:32.009> matter<00:01:32.930> actually<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.710> like

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
doesn't matter actually very much like

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
doesn't matter actually very much like
this<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.460> could<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.909> could<00:01:36.000> pretty<00:01:36.150> much<00:01:36.240> go

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
this you could you could pretty much go

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.710 
this you could you could pretty much go
in<00:01:36.780> at<00:01:37.110> any<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:38.150> you'll<00:01:39.150> want<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> wait<00:01:39.540> until

breaking<00:02:32.890> through<00:02:33.160> waves<00:02:33.430> not<00:02:34.360> too<00:02:34.630> much<00:02:34.840> to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
breaking through waves not too much to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.560 
breaking through waves not too much to
know<00:02:35.800> there<00:02:36.100> except<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.510> be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
know there except you have to be

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.199 
know there except you have to be
perpendicular<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.560> wave<00:02:39.209> especially

perpendicular to the wave especially

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.050 
perpendicular to the wave especially
when<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.480> breaking<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.550> breaking

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
when it's breaking and if it is breaking

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.310 
when it's breaking and if it is breaking
and<00:02:43.090> you're<00:02:43.239> going<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.420> have<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.989> punch

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
and you're going to have to really punch

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.680 
and you're going to have to really punch
through<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.739> then<00:02:45.190> take<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.790> last<00:02:46.090> powerful

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
through it then take a last powerful

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.260 
through it then take a last powerful
stroke<00:02:46.930> as<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.590> hit<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:48.010> that's<00:02:48.700> stroke<00:02:49.090> but

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
stroke as you hit it that's stroke but

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.180 
stroke as you hit it that's stroke but
does<00:02:49.450> two<00:02:49.660> things<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:50.260> helps<00:02:50.530> pull<00:02:51.040> you

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
does two things it helps pull you

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.400 
does two things it helps pull you
through<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.670> way<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.450> also<00:02:52.600> stabilizes

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
through the way but it also stabilizes

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.900 
through the way but it also stabilizes
you<00:02:53.830> if<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.070> don't<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> blade<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.850> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
you if you don't have a blade in the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.479 
you if you don't have a blade in the
water<00:02:55.180> then<00:02:55.900> when<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.860> wave<00:02:57.040> hits<00:02:57.280> you

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
water then when you that wave hits you

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.850 
water then when you that wave hits you
you<00:02:57.820> can<00:02:57.970> flip<00:02:58.239> left<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.900> can<00:02:59.050> flip<00:02:59.290> right<00:02:59.590> you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
you can flip left you can flip right you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.900 
you can flip left you can flip right you
don't<00:03:00.010> know<00:03:00.250> which<00:03:00.400> way<00:03:00.580> you're<00:03:00.610> going<00:03:00.820> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
don't know which way you're going to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.479 
don't know which way you're going to
flip<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.690> take<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.110> stroke<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:03.100> acting

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
flip if you take that stroke it's acting

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.250 
flip if you take that stroke it's acting
as<00:03:03.610> much<00:03:03.790> as<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> power<00:03:04.360> stroke<00:03:04.780> through<00:03:05.049> as<00:03:05.230> a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
as much as a power stroke through as a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.949 
as much as a power stroke through as a
braced<00:03:05.709> for<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.760> two<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.330> support<00:03:07.900> yourself

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
braced for you two to support yourself

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.009 
braced for you two to support yourself
on<00:03:08.910> another<00:03:09.910> thing<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.180> like<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.360> do<00:03:10.540> two<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
on another thing I like to do two of the

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.720 
on another thing I like to do two of the
waves<00:03:11.200> big<00:03:11.440> enough<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.830> as<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.310> take<00:03:12.549> that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
waves big enough is as I take that

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.199 
waves big enough is as I take that
stroke<00:03:13.090> I'll<00:03:13.480> tuck<00:03:14.200> my<00:03:14.709> head<00:03:15.040> in<00:03:15.340> behind<00:03:16.000> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
stroke I'll tuck my head in behind the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.300 
stroke I'll tuck my head in behind the
top<00:03:16.450> arm<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.650> cushions<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.190> blow

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
top arm and that just cushions the blow

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.820 
top arm and that just cushions the blow
of<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.790> breaking<00:03:19.030> wave<00:03:19.420> against<00:03:20.140> my<00:03:20.260> ear<00:03:20.290> and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
of that breaking wave against my ear and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.440 
of that breaking wave against my ear and
against<00:03:21.070> my<00:03:21.160> face<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.610> it's<00:03:21.940> amazing<00:03:22.090> how

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
against my face and it's amazing how

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.750 
against my face and it's amazing how
much<00:03:22.660> power<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.350> breaking<00:03:23.890> wave<00:03:24.010> can<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.519> when

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
much power a breaking wave can have when

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.970 
much power a breaking wave can have when
it<00:03:24.880> hits<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.269> so
