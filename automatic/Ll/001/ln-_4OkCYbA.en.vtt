00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
so about a month ago I had the idea to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.990 
so about a month ago I had the idea to
do<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> blindfolded<00:00:22.740> baking<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:23.460> right

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
do a blindfolded baking and then right

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580 
do a blindfolded baking and then right
when<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> got<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> idea<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.960> week<00:00:25.170> later<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
when I got the idea a week later I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.470 
when I got the idea a week later I
thought<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.099> Jack<00:00:26.340> did<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.390> very

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
thought so Jack did it and it's very

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
thought so Jack did it and it's very
strange<00:00:28.050> because<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> third

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
strange because this is like the third

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160 
strange because this is like the third
time<00:00:29.369> have<00:00:29.849> come<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> video<00:00:30.480> idea<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270

my video ideas because every time I have

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.180
