00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.289 
the final answer the elaborate puzzle I
know<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> problem<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:27.060> when<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> type

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
know so the problem is when you type

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.720 
know so the problem is when you type
something<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.780> on<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.170> website<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.590> submit<00:02:29.950> it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
something in on the website to submit it

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.979 
something in on the website to submit it
gives<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> picture<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.780> you're<00:02:31.870> supposed

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
gives you a picture and you're supposed

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.050 
gives you a picture and you're supposed
to<00:02:32.140> take<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.590> picture<00:02:32.829> and<00:02:33.340> look<00:02:33.880> at<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
to take that picture and look at the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.840 
to take that picture and look at the
picture<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.630> find<00:02:35.019> common<00:02:35.680> things<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.400> groups

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
picture and find common things in groups

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.970 
picture and find common things in groups
of<00:02:37.120> three<00:02:37.390> or<00:02:37.420> something<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.049> I<00:02:38.470> I

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
of three or something like that I I

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.920 
of three or something like that I I
think<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.549> said<00:02:39.730> I'm<00:02:39.910> not<00:02:40.090> sure<00:02:40.299> only<00:02:40.690> three

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
think it said I'm not sure only three

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.690 
think it said I'm not sure only three
days<00:02:41.079> in<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.530> don't<00:02:41.680> know<00:02:41.739> much<00:02:41.890> about<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.220> no

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
days in I don't know much about it no

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.890 
days in I don't know much about it no
matter<00:02:42.850> what<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.150> type<00:02:43.329> in<00:02:43.510> though<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.780> will

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
matter what you type in though it will

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.420 
matter what you type in though it will
always<00:02:44.079> give<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.470> picture<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:45.220> try<00:02:45.310> to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
always give you a picture to try to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.060 
always give you a picture to try to
throw<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> off<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.269> always<00:02:46.480> different

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
throw you off and it's always different

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.229 
throw you off and it's always different
well<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.370> same<00:02:48.579> for<00:02:48.970> because<00:02:49.180> I've

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
well it's the same for because I've

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.340 
well it's the same for because I've
tried<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.510> type<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.019> bunch<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.230> random

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
tried to type in just a bunch of random

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.930 
tried to type in just a bunch of random
stuff<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:50.980> always<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.430> same<00:02:51.610> no<00:02:51.850> matter

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
stuff and it's always the same no matter

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.280 
stuff and it's always the same no matter
if<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.209> type<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.600> same<00:02:52.780> thing<00:02:52.989> over<00:02:53.170> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
if you type in the same thing over and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.720 
if you type in the same thing over and
over<00:02:53.590> again<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.070> can't<00:02:54.250> just<00:02:54.370> find<00:02:54.579> out

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
over again so you can't just find out

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.860 
over again so you can't just find out
which<00:02:54.850> ones<00:02:55.060> are<00:02:55.150> random<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.570> which<00:02:55.660> ones

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
which ones are random and which ones

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350 
which ones are random and which ones
aren't<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.730> don't<00:02:57.880> know<00:02:57.970> which<00:02:58.090> ones<00:02:58.269> are

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
aren't but you don't know which ones are

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.000 
aren't but you don't know which ones are
important<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:58.989> have<00:02:59.230> no<00:02:59.380> idea<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.739> glue

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
important so I have no idea of that glue

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.009 
important so I have no idea of that glue
if<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.090> clue<00:03:01.239> at<00:03:01.390> all<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.690> might<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:01.930> be

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
if it's a clue at all it might just be

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.170 
if it's a clue at all it might just be
part<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.320> envelope<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:02.709> either<00:03:02.920> way

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
part of the envelope but either way

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.369 
part of the envelope but either way
again<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.360> don't<00:03:04.420> know<00:03:04.600> which<00:03:04.840> day<00:03:05.019> this<00:03:05.170> is

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
again I don't know which day this is

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.119 
again I don't know which day this is
because<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.819> didn't<00:03:07.090> tell<00:03:07.239> me<00:03:07.950> there<00:03:08.950> was<00:03:08.980> no

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
because it didn't tell me there was no

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.470 
because it didn't tell me there was no
card<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.670> one<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.940> say<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.360> day

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480

three but

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.630 
three but
either<00:03:11.349> way<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.709> looks<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.040> pack<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.280> cars

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
either way it looks like a pack of cars

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.850 
either way it looks like a pack of cars
against<00:03:12.819> humanity<00:03:13.180> carts<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.959> say<00:03:14.200> ten<00:03:14.590> days
