two games

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.210 
two games
I<00:01:05.580> mean<00:01:05.790> Batman<00:01:06.600> Arkham<00:01:06.840> City<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
I mean Batman Arkham City is the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
I mean Batman Arkham City is the
quintessential<00:01:09.350> superhero<00:01:10.350> game<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:11.070> which

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
quintessential superhero game on which

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.880 
quintessential superhero game on which
all<00:01:11.610> future<00:01:12.140> superhero<00:01:13.140> games<00:01:13.409> should<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
all future superhero games should be

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.600 
all future superhero games should be
judged<00:01:14.659> as<00:01:15.659> opposed<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> Skyrim<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
judged as opposed to that Skyrim is

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
judged as opposed to that Skyrim is
probably<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> quintessential<00:01:19.049> open-world

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
probably the quintessential open-world

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
probably the quintessential open-world
fantasy<00:01:20.520> RPG<00:01:20.729> against<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.570> all<00:01:21.810> other

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
fantasy RPG against which all other

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.890 
fantasy RPG against which all other
open-world<00:01:22.710> RPGs<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.479> compared

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
open-world RPGs are going to be compared

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.310 
open-world RPGs are going to be compared
to<00:01:25.170> after<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:27.960> games

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to after this so when you have two games

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.760 
to after this so when you have two games
that<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:28.950> respective<00:01:29.280> genres<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.150> games

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
that in their respective genres of games

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
that in their respective genres of games
actually<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.340> best<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.000> my<00:01:33.240> opinion<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.289 
actually are the best in my opinion it
became<00:01:34.650> almost<00:01:34.979> impossible<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:36.119> make<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299

in my personal opinion both Skyrim and

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.120 
in my personal opinion both Skyrim and
Batman<00:02:39.340> Arkham<00:02:39.550> City<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:41.200> best<00:02:41.470> games<00:02:41.800> in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
Batman Arkham City are the best games in

to them in the future however when it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.280 
to them in the future however when it
comes<00:02:51.790> down<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.600> quality<00:02:53.200> of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
comes down to it and the quality of

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.260 
comes down to it and the quality of
these<00:02:53.410> two<00:02:53.650> games<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.940> say<00:02:55.090> they're

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
these two games I have to say they're

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.210 
these two games I have to say they're
equal<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.780> pretty<00:02:56.080> much<00:02:56.170> like<00:02:56.620> these<00:02:56.980> games

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
equal I pretty much like these games

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.270 
equal I pretty much like these games
equally<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:59.530> would<00:02:59.770> mean<00:02:59.950> that<00:02:59.980> is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
equally and that would mean that is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.710 
equally and that would mean that is
something<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.550> be<00:03:00.790> said<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.330> that's<00:03:01.570> why

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
something to be said and that's why

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.360 
something to be said and that's why
actually<00:03:01.930> when<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.200> reviewed<00:03:02.620> both<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:03.010> them<00:03:03.190> I

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
actually when I reviewed both of them I

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.070 
actually when I reviewed both of them I
gave<00:03:03.760> them<00:03:03.880> both<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.209> same<00:03:04.239> review<00:03:04.630> score<00:03:04.930> of

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
gave them both the same review score of

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.920 
gave them both the same review score of
a<00:03:05.140> 9.5<00:03:05.709> but<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.549> had<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.060> make<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.239> choice<00:03:07.570> and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
a 9.5 but I had to make a choice and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.690 
a 9.5 but I had to make a choice and
what<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.170> had<00:03:08.320> to<00:03:08.500> eventually<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:09.070> down<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.489> was

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
what it had to eventually go down to was

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.800 
what it had to eventually go down to was
what<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.120> major<00:03:10.299> difference<00:03:10.570> between

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.140 
what is the major difference between
these<00:03:11.110> two<00:03:11.350> games<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.670> amount<00:03:12.940> of
