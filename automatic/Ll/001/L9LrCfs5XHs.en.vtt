00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
hi this is Chuck from big garden shop

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.020 
hi this is Chuck from big garden shop
and<00:00:07.740> today<00:00:08.099> we're<00:00:08.280> just<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.670> learn<00:00:08.790> how

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and today we're just going to learn how

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.330 
and today we're just going to learn how
to<00:00:09.059> tie<00:00:09.510> down<00:00:09.540> our<00:00:09.780> daffodils<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.769> that's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to tie down our daffodils and that's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.190 
to tie down our daffodils and that's
just<00:00:11.580> something<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.969> need<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:13.049> know

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
just something you need to do to know

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.749 
just something you need to do to know
that<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> daffodils<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.429> go<00:00:14.549> through

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
that the daffodils have to go through

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.580 
that the daffodils have to go through
the<00:00:14.880> full<00:00:15.150> cycle<00:00:15.179> which<00:00:16.139> means<00:00:16.410> you've

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the full cycle which means you've

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.500 
the full cycle which means you've
planted<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.460> fall<00:00:17.760> they've<00:00:18.210> come<00:00:18.480> up

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
planted them in the fall they've come up

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.920 
planted them in the fall they've come up
in<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> spring<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.560> then<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.180> need<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
in the spring and then do you need a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.410 
in the spring and then do you need a
flower<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:22.710> they're<00:00:23.250> spent<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
flower and then they're spent but you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.929 
flower and then they're spent but you
need<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.189> go<00:00:26.340> through<00:00:26.550> their<00:00:26.730> full

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
need to have them go through their full

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.150 
need to have them go through their full
cycle<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.660> them<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.960> repeat<00:00:28.410> their<00:00:28.680> bloom<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
cycle for them to repeat their bloom the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
cycle for them to repeat their bloom the
next<00:00:29.460> year<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.390> important<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.050> just

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
next year so it's important not to just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.080 
next year so it's important not to just
mow<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:32.040> because<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.610> tend<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
mow them down because they do tend to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.270 
mow them down because they do tend to
get<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.510> ugly<00:00:33.780> here's<00:00:34.500> an<00:00:34.620> example<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.160> how

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
get very ugly here's an example of how

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.600 
get very ugly here's an example of how
daffodils<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.090> beautiful<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:37.079> are

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
daffodils as beautiful as they are

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.069 
daffodils as beautiful as they are
always<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:39.059> towards<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> end<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
always then towards the end of the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.979 
always then towards the end of the
season<00:00:40.469> once<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.920> spent<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.120> look<00:00:42.360> awful

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
season once or spent you just look awful

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
season once or spent you just look awful
in<00:00:43.170> your<00:00:43.469> garden<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.370> again<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.940> need<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> go

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in your garden but again you need to go

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
in your garden but again you need to go
through<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> full<00:00:46.079> cycle<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.829> them<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
through the full cycle with them so the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.180 
through the full cycle with them so the
best<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.270> do<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> try<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.590> diminish

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
best thing to do is try to just diminish

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.910 
best thing to do is try to just diminish
the<00:00:50.430> look<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.600> easiest<00:00:52.020> way<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
the look and the easiest way I think to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160 
the look and the easiest way I think to
do<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.149> take<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> clump<00:00:54.899> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
do this is to take the clump of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.830 
do this is to take the clump of
daffodils<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:59.300> get<00:01:00.300> them<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> one

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
daffodils that you have get them in one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
daffodils that you have get them in one
clump<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> simply<00:01:03.439> tie<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> knot<00:01:07.580> this<00:01:08.580> gives

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
clump and simply tie a knot this gives

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.480 
clump and simply tie a knot this gives
you<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.750> clump<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.680> eventually<00:01:10.950> other

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you a little clump that eventually other

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
you a little clump that eventually other
plants<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.299> grow<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.380> let's<00:01:13.530> try

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
plants will grow over so let's try

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.999 
plants will grow over so let's try
another<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.939> full<00:01:15.240> plant<00:01:16.009> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
another one get the full plant the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.050 
another one get the full plant the
leaves<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.670> flowers<00:01:18.119> everything<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.820> make<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
leaves the flowers everything and make a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.039 
leaves the flowers everything and make a
full<00:01:22.100> not<00:01:23.100> pulling<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.780> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
full not pulling it just a one not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.670 
full not pulling it just a one not
bringing<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> center<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.680> making

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
bringing it up in the center and making

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
bringing it up in the center and making
this<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> eventually

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
this little thing here that eventually

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.319 
this little thing here that eventually
will<00:01:30.840> grow<00:01:31.110> over<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:32.280> another<00:01:32.640> method<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> do

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
will grow over now another method to do

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
will grow over now another method to do
that<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.049> people<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that a lot of people think this is a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.030 
that a lot of people think this is a
better<00:01:35.250> looking<00:01:35.820> method<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.680> it's<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.920> an

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
better looking method or it's just an

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190 
better looking method or it's just an
easier<00:01:38.490> method<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.329> people<00:01:39.720> focus<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
easier method for some people focus of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.499 
easier method for some people focus of
some<00:01:40.470> reason<00:01:40.890> even<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.610> crew<00:01:41.880> has<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> hard<00:01:42.450> time

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
some reason even my crew has a hard time

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.590 
some reason even my crew has a hard time
tying<00:01:43.049> knot<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.770> these<00:01:44.430> daffodils<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.270> think

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
tying knot in these daffodils I think

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
tying knot in these daffodils I think
it's<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> easiest<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.829> doing<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.490> do

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
it's the easiest way of doing you can do

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.030 
it's the easiest way of doing you can do
your<00:01:47.759> whole<00:01:48.079> front<00:01:49.079> yard<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.860> very

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
your whole front yard in them very

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.490 
your whole front yard in them very
quickly<00:01:50.579> by<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.329> doing<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.689> knot<00:01:51.960> system

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
quickly by just doing this knot system

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.490 
quickly by just doing this knot system
but<00:01:53.130> another<00:01:53.399> way<00:01:53.700> would<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.500> take

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
but another way would just to be take

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
but another way would just to be take
them<00:01:56.840> bend<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.140> half<00:01:58.610> take<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.790> rubber

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
them bend them in half take your rubber

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.430 
them bend them in half take your rubber
band

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.250 

simply<00:02:04.440> put<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.010> rubber<00:02:05.220> band<00:02:05.550> around<00:02:06.540> so

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
simply put the rubber band around so

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.830 
simply put the rubber band around so
again<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:08.280> we're<00:02:08.460> doing<00:02:08.790> is<00:02:09.030> tying<00:02:09.420> up<00:02:09.690> our

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
again what we're doing is tying up our

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
again what we're doing is tying up our
daffodils<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.550> they<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.790> go<00:02:11.910> through

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
daffodils so that they can go through

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.810 
daffodils so that they can go through
their<00:02:12.270> full<00:02:12.570> cycle<00:02:13.110> through<00:02:13.820> planting

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
their full cycle through planting

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.230 
their full cycle through planting
through<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> bulb<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.860> these<00:02:17.070> being<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
through the bulb to these being this the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.420 
through the bulb to these being this the
flower<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.840> spent<00:02:19.320> with<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> Leafs<00:02:20.070> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
flower that's spent with the Leafs and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.750 
flower that's spent with the Leafs and
then<00:02:21.180> tying<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.960> up<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.590> goes<00:02:22.800> again<00:02:23.430> back

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
then tying that up so it goes again back

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.730 
then tying that up so it goes again back
to<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> earth<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> way<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
to the earth and this is the way to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.400 
to the earth and this is the way to
guarantee<00:02:26.010> blooms<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> next<00:02:27.390> year<00:02:27.660> thank
