 summer holidays max spent every year 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.170
 in a small village 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.590

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.140
 one evening Max got bored of playing 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 to one 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.370

 and then we play surprisingly not that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.490
 you did not hear about three pigs 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.310
 the farm was piglets fur coat cool for hours 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.730
 dreamed and not about how to get them 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:43.850
 courage and get away with bright yes and tired of them 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.130
 listen to the rooster in the morning once they 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.520
 braced up and went to 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.250
 adventure quest excited well 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.660
 joyful they jumped the fence and went out 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.660
 to the big world 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.640
 three little pigs 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.349
 piglets wandered around the world for a long time 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.480
 they visited huge capitals but 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.180
 once stumbled upon a small town 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.769
 the most wonderful of all they saw 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.370
 beauty 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.370
 exclaimed the little pig 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:34.410
 and without thinking twice they decided to settle down and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:37.290
 on there now need to build a house said 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.540
 senior let's buy bricks we build 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:47.790
 house and let us live there in yours 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:50.060
 but the brothers idea I suppose I do not want to say 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.960
 our bricks are heavy 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.960
 I want a house of straw and I do not like 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.120
 hard work said medium is better 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.500
 build a wooden house from branches 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 piglets argued for a long time agreed 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.950
 that each of them build their own 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:16.010
 own house younger took a straw 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 historians are not built in a flash changed 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.220
 in the middle pig also set about 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:39.099
 work on scored branches and hastily 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:42.849
 he built his delegate house 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.909
 the eldest worked the emphasis tirelessly dragging 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.159
 he bricks back and forth 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.519
 Slowly probably built a strong house 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:57.040
 sine roof which snow and rain all 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:04:00.220
 why didn't he work hard 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.269
 but did not give up although his brothers fun 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.269
 played volleyball 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.690
 by the end of the day all three houses were ready 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.630
 and high in the sky twinkling crescent three 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.410
 the pig went out the lights and set off 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.410
 sleep 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.570
 and suddenly in silence there was a terrible howl 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:46.339
 then the hungry, angry wolf forgot 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.060
 I smell fresh meat 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.690
 said the wolf swallowed drool after seeing 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:05.640
 straw house wolf laughed as well and 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.640
 too much poison I spit too'll blow the engine 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.430
 the younger pig ran off to escape 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:18.190
 to my brother 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:23.490
 the wolf came up to the wooden house already food 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.490
 I 'll spit this little house 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.889
 two terrified pigs hurried 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.889
 take refuge in the elder brother's house 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.639
 But the wolf did not think to give off 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.220
 he to the third house 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:47.050
 opa-ah hell too well, too much dish 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:50.610
 I will spread this upholstery and puffed wolves nozzles 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.210
 and blew what was the strength to the house did not flinch 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.490
 tried again 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.770
 so scary bull paired tree trunks 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.020
 flew and even we have the sky 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.020
 but the house and non-residential nulis 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.400
 enraged wolf realized that without dinner 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.860
 page 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.380
 and decided by all means to get through 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.080
 in a strong house nothing better walk not 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.710
 Invented what to go under the chimney as 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.710
 Santa Claus 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.820
 piglets in the house scared to death 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.860
 but the elder quickly figured out the wolf plan 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.860
 and lit a bright fire in the fireplace 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.920
 worked wolf fell right on the coals and 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.660
 set himself a horse 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.900
 so only that he screamed so you 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.510
 African and they woke up with a tail 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.150
 burning like a wick in a petard Volga 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:58.940
 flew down the chimney and never three 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.940
 the piglet was no longer seen 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.950
 many years have passed but the wolf could now 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.860
 sit only on his side so much he 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.450
 that day they were burning it was said that he 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:26.280
 became a vegetarian and only eat 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:29.000
 low fat yogurt and they no longer 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.300
 saw asked max 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.210
 not 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.710
 the lesson was given to the wolf at a great price and not for 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:41.009
 that he did not want to eat pigs now 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:45.419
 so let's start the game or work asked 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:48.229
 grandfather first finish the roof answered max 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.229
 I will help 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.909
 and they got to work together when 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.710
 everyone finished went to play with 

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:58.710
 red ball
