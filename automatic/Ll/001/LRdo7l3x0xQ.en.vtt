be doing a video on how to change the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.680 
be doing a video on how to change the
firing<00:00:15.250> modes<00:00:15.730> and<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.930> BPS<00:00:17.680> on<00:00:18.690> your

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
firing modes and the BPS on your

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.870 
firing modes and the BPS on your
environment<00:00:20.170> so<00:00:21.779> yeah<00:00:22.779> lets<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.380> started<00:00:23.880> if

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
is the modes on the stock board not on

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:01.709 
is the modes on the stock board not on
like<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.320> virtue<00:00:53.680> or<00:00:53.949> Teddy<00:00:54.460> board<00:00:59.160> okay<00:01:00.719> now

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
like a virtue or Teddy board okay now

like a virtue or Teddy board okay now
won't<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:01.960> taking<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.440> screw<00:01:02.710> off<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
won't you taking that screw off the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.000 
won't you taking that screw off the
plate<00:01:05.350> should<00:01:05.500> just<00:01:05.649> come<00:01:05.830> off<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.860> once

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
plate should just come off and so once

battery and your board is right here and
I<00:01:16.510> don't<00:01:16.659> know<00:01:16.720> if<00:01:16.780> you<00:01:16.869> guys<00:01:17.020> can<00:01:17.080> see<00:01:18.119> but

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
I don't know if you guys can see but

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.999 
I don't know if you guys can see but
right<00:01:19.479> where<00:01:19.689> my<00:01:19.720> index<00:01:20.200> finger<00:01:20.259> is<00:01:20.500> there's<00:01:20.950> a

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
right where my index finger is there's a

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.160 
right where my index finger is there's a
little<00:01:21.340> black<00:01:21.549> button<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.360> that's<00:01:22.930> how<00:01:23.110> you

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
little black button and that's how you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.399 
little black button and that's how you
get<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:24.220> change<00:01:24.549> your<00:01:24.939> firing<00:01:25.240> modes<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:28.409> there

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
get to change your firing modes so there

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.289 
get to change your firing modes so there
is<00:01:29.680> trying<00:01:30.400> to<00:01:30.520> figure<00:01:30.640> out<00:01:30.759> what<00:01:30.880> are<00:01:31.180> these

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
is trying to figure out what are these

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.230 
is trying to figure out what are these
go<00:01:31.479> into<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.650> I<00:01:33.189> think<00:01:33.520> first<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.240> semi<00:01:34.930> auto

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
go into and I think first is semi auto

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.649 
go into and I think first is semi auto
second<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.360> either<00:01:37.619> PSP<00:01:38.619> or<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.130> Excel<00:01:39.659> third

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
second is either PSP or in Excel third

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.929 
second is either PSP or in Excel third
is<00:01:40.840> either<00:01:40.990> PSP<00:01:41.590> are<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:41.799> XL<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:42.400> then<00:01:42.549> fourth

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
is either PSP are in XL and then fourth

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.929 
is either PSP are in XL and then fourth
I<00:01:43.240> know<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.750> ramp<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:48.670> you're<00:01:48.759> going<00:01:48.880> to

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
I know is ramp so what you're going to

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.940 
I know is ramp so what you're going to

that's PSP this is the second mode

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:17.940 
that's PSP this is the second mode
yep<00:04:10.780> now<00:04:11.440> we're<00:04:11.620> PSP<00:04:14.310> yeah<00:04:16.650> that's<00:04:17.650> how<00:04:17.890> you

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
change the mode so the BPS it's been a

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.540 
change the mode so the BPS it's been a
while<00:04:22.330> since<00:04:22.510> I've<00:04:22.660> done<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.870> um<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:24.340> think

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
and i push it two times because i wanted

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.370 
and i push it two times because i wanted
to<00:05:25.300> go<00:05:25.390> up<00:05:25.540> so<00:05:26.580> it'll<00:05:27.580> go<00:05:27.900> it'll<00:05:28.900> blink<00:05:29.169> how

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
to go up so it'll go it'll blink how

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.930 
to go up so it'll go it'll blink how
many<00:05:30.180> times<00:05:31.230> which<00:05:32.230> indicates<00:05:32.800> what<00:05:33.220> BPS<00:05:33.700> are

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
many times which indicates what BPS are

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.890 
many times which indicates what BPS are
in<00:05:34.120> I<00:05:34.590> didn't<00:05:35.590> count<00:05:35.830> that<00:05:36.100> if<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:36.910> guys<00:05:37.090> did<00:05:37.390> I

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
in I didn't count that if you guys did I

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.020 
in I didn't count that if you guys did I
guess<00:05:38.169> somewhere<00:05:38.440> around<00:05:38.560> on<00:05:38.890> 14<00:05:39.340> or<00:05:39.490> 15<00:05:39.640> I

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
guess somewhere around on 14 or 15 I

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.830 
guess somewhere around on 14 or 15 I
don't<00:05:40.780> know<00:05:40.840> but<00:05:41.130> to<00:05:42.130> go<00:05:42.280> down<00:05:42.750> you're<00:05:43.750> going

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
don't know but to go down you're going

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.710 
don't know but to go down you're going
to<00:05:43.930> push<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.560> black<00:05:44.890> button<00:05:44.950> twice<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:46.180> will

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
to push the black button twice it will

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.560 
to push the black button twice it will
go<00:05:46.840> solid<00:05:47.260> green<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.190> you'll<00:05:48.910> use<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:49.300> power

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
go solid green and you'll use the power

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.000 
go solid green and you'll use the power
button<00:05:49.780> to<00:05:49.930> go<00:05:50.020> down<00:05:50.230> like<00:05:50.470> you<00:05:50.620> did<00:05:50.650> with<00:05:50.830> your

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
button to go down like you did with your

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.400 
button to go down like you did with your
modes<00:05:51.280> so<00:05:52.090> let<00:05:52.210> me<00:05:52.270> do<00:05:52.390> that<00:05:52.540> so<00:05:52.840> you<00:05:52.900> push<00:05:53.230> the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
modes so let me do that so you push the

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.430 
modes so let me do that so you push the
black<00:05:53.590> button<00:05:53.650> twice<00:05:56.400> solid<00:05:57.400> you're<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:58.440> when

black button twice solid you're in when
I<00:05:59.530> push<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.830> power<00:06:00.040> in<00:06:00.310> twice<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:01.780> should

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
I push the power in twice it should

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.189 
I push the power in twice it should
blink<00:06:02.230> what<00:06:02.950> BP<00:06:03.340> SRA

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.609 
that was just a quick video on how to
change<00:06:18.709> bps<00:06:19.429> and<00:06:19.759> fire<00:06:20.209> modes<00:06:20.569> of<00:06:20.929> your<00:06:21.319> invert

00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:21.619 
change bps and fire modes of your invert

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:24.749 
change bps and fire modes of your invert
