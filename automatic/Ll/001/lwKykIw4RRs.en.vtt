time<00:01:09.619> they<00:01:10.010> run<00:01:10.220> some<00:01:10.580> seems<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.060> be<00:01:11.210> very<00:01:11.659> bold

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
time they run some seems to be very bold

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.840

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.380 
I don't seem they are Swarovski and that
bothers<00:01:18.409> me<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.650> little<00:01:18.770> bit<00:01:19.040> because<00:01:19.790> I<00:01:20.270> think

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
bothers me a little bit because I think

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.420 
bothers me a little bit because I think
they<00:01:20.720> run<00:01:20.930> between<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.380> hundred<00:01:21.680> fifty<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.400> two

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430

hundred<00:01:22.549> dollars<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:23.360> far<00:01:23.540> up<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.900> kind<00:01:24.290> of

hundred dollars so far up that kind of

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.050 
hundred dollars so far up that kind of
money<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.740> probably<00:01:25.009> would<00:01:25.250> like<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.430> have<00:01:25.610> some

here has a little tiny elastic on the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.149 
here has a little tiny elastic on the
side<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.820> he<00:01:47.510> actually<00:01:47.720> adjust<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.620> your<00:01:48.800> feet

very easy to move and my feet look very
sexy<00:01:55.600> well<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.930> think<00:01:57.260> it's<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:59.590> okay<00:02:00.590> shoe

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
sexy well I think it's a okay shoe

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.160 
sexy well I think it's a okay shoe
because<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.000> would<00:02:02.180> like<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> higher

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
because I would like to have a higher

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.830 
because I would like to have a higher
heel<00:02:03.560> for<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:04.010> kind<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.340> sexy<00:02:04.760> shoe<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.270> think

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
heel for this kind of sexy shoe I think

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.589 
heel for this kind of sexy shoe I think
the<00:02:05.960> heel<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.320> too<00:02:06.590> low<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.640> other<00:02:08.000> hand<00:02:08.360> if

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
the heel is too low on the other hand if

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.520 
the heel is too low on the other hand if
you<00:02:08.720> planning<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.170> dance<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.590> lot<00:02:11.260> that's<00:02:12.260> me

but<00:02:13.450> still<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.659> can<00:02:14.930> manage<00:02:15.230> higher<00:02:15.440> heels<00:02:15.799> so

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
but still I can manage higher heels so

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.479 
but still I can manage higher heels so
that<00:02:16.519> this<00:02:16.849> shoe<00:02:17.120> was<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.500> my

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
that this shoe was not up to my
