 in today's program you will check 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.449
 how to make this effect is that you are 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 seeing on the screen so it is an effect as 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.029
 make cv put a video inside a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 picture of a television or monitor 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.740
 Do you want to learn how do you like it? 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.210
 so start now and one more course 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.210
 practical and sony vegas 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.410
 Hi everyone, The peace of Christ to everyone. 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 I am pastor leonardo campos and start 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.960
 now a practical program of 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.430
 sony vegas aquino bpve tv2 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.710
 and in today's hour we will learn 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.070
 make this effect is what you saw in the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.800
 beginning of this video then for that already 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.649
 I'm already here with a video in my here 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.989
 with me that I am also with 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.470
 a static image that I downloaded in the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.140
 internet even here the monitor 18 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.479
 TV straight on the table so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 do not change the bench and the idea with how 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.530
 did you see in the introduction? 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.340
 We're going to put this video here where 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.400
 I'm here inside this monitor on 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.259
 proportion of this screen then teach 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.130
 that you need two tracks of 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.860
 video 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.619
 It's logical that if you make an edit 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.150
 just like the video with audio 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.680
 everything cute will have a clue 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 audio also removed a long time ago that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.710
 will need I will show how 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.740
 does 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 is in this case the effect even remembering that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.890
 you need to have the image below the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 video that will effect you will 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.920
 put into the TV of the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.500
 monitor 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.259
 The video you're going to play needs to be 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 top with 25 or here at the event 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.770
 with cop will open this window here is the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.920
 What are you going to do first? 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.509
 will mark here the size and cent will 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.479
 tagging this tool will mark this 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.489
 here also good that the aspect ratio 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.440
 have to be with these two tools 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.260
 marked for your video not lost 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.379
 aspect here widescreen 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 André goes there in everything with good people, I 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.610
 I'll tap the left button 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.069
 here in own dei led to skol 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.409
 back down is better saying 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:31.349
 to decrease so it was easy now 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:33.900
 I'll pull, I'll pull, you have to. 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.640
 pulling the personnel until the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.500
 right proportion 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 a tip here is important let's put 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.150
 always when you want to upload the video 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.730
 you get it here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.260
 there is this 7 here when she is 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 so type a cross 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.280
 she goes everywhere when you 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.170
 puts it so it just goes right 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.930
 or to the left and when you place 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.010
 so it just goes down or 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.349
 down 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.769
 remembering that here in the event bancoop 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.370
 When you push up and down there. 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.709
 and when you put it down and up 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.650
 also the same effect of the 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.720
 put the side aside and go to the other arrangement 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.030
 basic then here are also the people 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.859
 Are you going to have to go up there? 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.739
 You'll have to take it easy and 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.699
 position the image right here 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.620
 inside I need to save time already 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:29.819
 had i left that joão preset 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.489
 here saves staff already with clothing is not 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.099
 This is it here, then let me see. 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.560
 Okay, okay. See you, it's already saved. 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.480
 already with the image all in here then 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.299
 game of patience you're coming to 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.549
 It gets here and it gets bigger. 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.169
 bit when you put it here 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:52.290
 you lower the image when you 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:54.569
 boot up you raise the image 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.340
 so you will even frame the image 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.609
 completely here on the screen of this 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.569
