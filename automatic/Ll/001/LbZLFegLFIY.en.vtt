00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
bit but if you think about it how many

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
bit but if you think about it how many
gigs<00:01:09.869> we've<00:01:10.049> done<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> past<00:01:10.530> without<00:01:10.799> LEDs

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
gigs we've done in the past without LEDs

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.330 
gigs we've done in the past without LEDs
so<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> mixture<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.710> both<00:01:13.860> LEDs

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so you know I got a mixture of both LEDs

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.039 
so you know I got a mixture of both LEDs
and<00:01:14.549> regular<00:01:16.250> fixture<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.720> let's<00:01:18.720> take<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> look
