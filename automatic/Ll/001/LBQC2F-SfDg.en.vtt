00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.540
 this new video that surely 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 it will affect many of you indeed 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.809
 talk about which samsung galaxy mi 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.500
 it's worth buying 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 in fact I ordered several models of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.939
 galaxy and I chose the best for each 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 price range example the best of the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.130
 300 is the best of 400 is the best 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.449
 of the five hundred is the and therefore now 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 we will discuss together which samsung 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.920
 galaxy really suits your needs 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.210
 of each individual user 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.649
 let's start with my first galaxy 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 favorite that the galaxy note is 7,000 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.239
 you have understood well it is not the galaxy s iii 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.579
 and I also explain you why the statistics 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.520
 hardware and software as well a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.949
 part certain novelties are very similar between 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.410
 the two terminals however the price between the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.199
 price of the galaxy note is that of the s3 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.360
 there is a difference of almost 200 euros 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.510
 so since the two devices are a lot 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.619
 similar in my opinion it is convenient to buy 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.530
 the galaxy note 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.110
 whereas in addition to the a 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.470
 according to me perfect equality with the galaxy 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.860
 s iii also a much larger screen 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 compared to ls3 precisely then second 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 I should buy the galaxy note 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.930
 because it is a saving of almost 200 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.630
 euros and you also have advantages that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.590
 with es 3 you don't have it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 one gigabyte ram hardware statistics 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 resolution of 1200 80 x 800 camera 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.220
 of 8 megapixels 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 can record video at 1920 x 1080 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.850
 hence a full hd 11 gigabyte memory 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:00.930
 expandable with a SD card weight 177 g 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.479
 android version 4.0.3 is here you can 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.610
 see how much it is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.130
 how often is it as big as e 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.170
 the broad 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.980
 we have the second competitor samsung 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.900
 galaxy s3 i9003 300 currently 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.120
 considered the top of the top in fact 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.370
 not be in second place for the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.360
 reason the verdict first as you can 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.040
 observe with your own eyes 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.530
 statistics and hardware and even software 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 however they are similar very similar to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.190
 galaxy note 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.600
 However, as you can see both a terminal is then 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.010
 a smaller screen price on the 589 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.880
 almost 600 ram ram of a gigabyte 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.660
 1280 x 720 resolution camera 8 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.060
 megapixel records video in full hd 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.360
 16 gigabyte memory expandable because 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.930
 to the slot to insert a sd card 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:05.650
 weight 133 g android version the latest 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.049
 currently available 4.0.4 there is one 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.590
 special novelty of the galaxy s iii 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.600
 or the introduction of s boys that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.459
 they would be kind of sciri for the iphone 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.410
 est voice for the uninitiated 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.750
 and for those who don't even know about Syrians, it is 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.150
 the sort of voice assistant with whom 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.340
 we can not only converse but 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.980
 we can also ask him to do 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.120
 something on a phone like for example 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.260
 create a reminder to find gods 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.799
 nearby restaurants kind of 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.910
 voice control but improved e 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.440
 optimized 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.660
 let's move on to the samsung galaxy nexus i9250 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.280
 this terminal is really really 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.410
 very good indeed at a price of 339 euros is 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.980
 just been updated with the last one 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.329
 firmware available on 4.0.4 a lot 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.790
 fluid ramadi a gigabyte and resolution 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.370
 1280 x 720 camera a little less 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.569
 compared to that of the 63 5 megapixels 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.590
 It runs video in full HD memory 13.5 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.360
 gigabyte 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.389
 the only flaw in my opinion of this 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.970
 terminal that memory is not 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:24.870
 expandable because not to the slot for 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.660
 insert the micro sd weight of 135 grams 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.000
 if you want to save some in my opinion 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.139
 this terminal really the best 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.330
 because it offers almost the best 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.669
 features both hardware and 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.139
 samsung software has a 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.139
 really cheap price 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.770
 samsung galaxy s plus i9001 this a little 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.669
 poor but it costs relatively much 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.979
 just 246 euros 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:59.310
 I must say that this terminal for the 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:04.669
 piece that has is quite satisfactory 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:08.520
 ram 512 megabytes resolution 800 x 480 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:12.810
 5 megapixel video camera in hd 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:17.250
 hence 1080 1200 80 x 720 fails to 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.840
 record in full HD memory 8 gigabytes 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.640
 and weight 177 g android version is a lot 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.039
 old the 2.3 that however for a 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.740
 user who has no great aspirations goes 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.530
 more than good 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.700
 then we pass to him the last part of 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.890
 this video is samsung galaxy 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.110
 absolutely to be avoided 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.240
 I recommend you don't buy them not for 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.550
 other but because they really don't deserve the 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.360
 price they have and are these samsung 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:54.510
 galaxy y pro and in my opinion it is really the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.340
 worst than samsung because it is 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:01.020
 completely different from the others has one 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.479
 nokia c3 style keyboard then 120 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.280
 euro in my opinion it is not worth it e 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.449
 then here we have a long list that does not 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.819
 I have 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.559
 I have not added the table with the 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.990
 hardware statistics because otherwise the 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:15.449
 video would have been really long and 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.520
 boring however stored these 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.909
 names and I recommend you do not buy them 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:23.819
 because only some cheats because 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:27.479
 they still make you spend enough 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:31.529
 money so much money and not worth the 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:33.360
 price that mount on the market 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:36.719
 well i hope this video is there 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.949
 useful as there is anyway 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:43.139
 served to clarify my ideas 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.139
 I refer you to the next video thanks 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:48.770
 attention sign up and comment 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.770
 Hello
