00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
be traveling from by the microphone with

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.750 
be traveling from by the microphone with
the<00:02:12.510> type<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.900> my<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.200> phone<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.520> it's<00:02:14.640> very

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the type on my go phone so it's very

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
the type on my go phone so it's very
sensitive<00:02:15.060> eyes<00:02:15.480> when<00:02:15.720> you're<00:02:15.900> not<00:02:16.470> using<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
North Shore feature but after you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.930 
North Shore feature but after you
pressing<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.930> noise<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.590> large<00:02:22.800> nacio<00:02:23.580> button

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
pressing the noise a large nacio button

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.900 
pressing the noise a large nacio button
for<00:02:24.180> three<00:02:24.360> seconds<00:02:24.720> or<00:02:24.810> activity<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.700> noise

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
for three seconds or activity the noise

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.710 
for three seconds or activity the noise
shield<00:02:27.209> feature<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.770> actually<00:02:29.220> cuts<00:02:29.850> out<00:02:30.120> most

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
shield feature it actually cuts out most

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.110 
shield feature it actually cuts out most
of<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.959> noise<00:02:31.260> well<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.340> cannot<00:02:32.910> say

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
of the noise well I cannot say

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.160 
of the noise well I cannot say
definitely<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.600> not<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> hundred<00:02:34.020> percent

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
definitely it's not a hundred percent

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.650 
definitely it's not a hundred percent
but<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.150> ninety-five

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
but like you know like a ninety-five

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.890 
but like you know like a ninety-five
percent<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> noise<00:02:37.470> around<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.390> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
percent of the noise around you and this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.920 
percent of the noise around you and this
one<00:02:40.170> basically<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.640> using<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.239> sensor<00:02:42.720> just

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
one basically is using this sensor just

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.199 
one basically is using this sensor just
sensed<00:02:43.319> like<00:02:43.500> what's<00:02:43.830> going<00:02:44.489> on<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> drama

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
sensed like what's going on with a drama

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.850 
sensed like what's going on with a drama
what<00:02:45.480> kind<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.750> vibration<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.530> could

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
what kind of vibration that you could

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.120 
what kind of vibration that you could
create<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.790> jaw<00:02:48.380> when<00:02:49.380> you're<00:02:49.590> talking

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
create on your jaw when you're talking

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.500 
create on your jaw when you're talking
when<00:02:50.489> you're<00:02:50.610> talking<00:02:50.940> on<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> phone<00:02:51.300> what

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
when you're talking on the phone what

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
when you're talking on the phone what
what<00:02:51.959> kind<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.200> frequency<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.580> would

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
what kind of frequency that you would

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.410 
what kind of frequency that you would
sense<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:57.390> a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
sense it and then you will have a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.520 
sense it and then you will have a
technology<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.319> can<00:02:59.510> detect<00:03:00.510> what<00:03:01.350> is

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
technology that you can detect what is

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.320 
technology that you can detect what is
actually<00:03:01.799> like<00:03:02.190> what<00:03:02.519> you're<00:03:02.730> talking<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
actually like what you're talking and

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330 
actually like what you're talking and
what<00:03:03.810> kind<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.019> sound<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.769> actually<00:03:05.220> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
what kind of sound that actually you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.440 
what kind of sound that actually you
need<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.580> shoot<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.160> forth<00:03:08.489> i'll<00:03:09.239> be

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
need to shoot out this so forth i'll be

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.830 
need to shoot out this so forth i'll be
using<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.970> not<00:03:11.970> only<00:03:12.120> for<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.540> this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
using like for not only for like this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.900 
using like for not only for like this
one<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.410> see<00:03:13.560> forward<00:03:14.130> headsets<00:03:14.549> already

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
one you can see forward headsets already

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.940 
one you can see forward headsets already
but<00:03:15.570> i've<00:03:15.690> been<00:03:15.840> using<00:03:15.989> like<00:03:16.350> more<00:03:16.560> than<00:03:16.650> 10

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
but i've been using like more than 10

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.240 
but i've been using like more than 10
bluetooth<00:03:17.459> headset<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:19.500> far<00:03:21.590> even<00:03:22.590> though<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
bluetooth headset so far even though the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.569 
bluetooth headset so far even though the
trouble<00:03:23.609> is<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> biggest<00:03:24.269> one<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.579> actually

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
trouble is the biggest one and actually

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.099 
trouble is the biggest one and actually
well<00:03:26.790> another<00:03:27.090> thing<00:03:27.180> i<00:03:27.390> didn't<00:03:27.690> mention<00:03:27.720> is

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
well another thing i didn't mention is

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.770 
well another thing i didn't mention is
like<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.470> wait<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> jawbone<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.880> not

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
like the wait for the jawbone is not

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.900 
like the wait for the jawbone is not
that<00:03:30.959> heavy<00:03:31.230> at<00:03:31.500> all<00:03:31.709> he'd<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:34.220> well<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.489> 12th

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
that heavy at all he'd it well the 12th

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.699 
that heavy at all he'd it well the 12th
one<00:03:36.120> actually<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.690> x12<00:03:37.140> actually<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.650> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
one actually the x12 actually it's a

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.400 
one actually the x12 actually it's a
little<00:03:37.950> bit<00:03:38.070> heavier<00:03:38.430> than<00:03:38.489> chopping<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.410> when

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
little bit heavier than chopping so when

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.280 
little bit heavier than chopping so when
when<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.739> wearing<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.450> took<00:03:42.450> him<00:03:42.630> compared<00:03:43.260> with

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
when I wearing it took him compared with

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.830 
when I wearing it took him compared with
the<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.040> other<00:03:44.160> head<00:03:44.880> Putin<00:03:45.359> had<00:03:45.480> said<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.690> I

the the other head Putin had said that I
had<00:03:46.049> before<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.280> one<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.640> most
