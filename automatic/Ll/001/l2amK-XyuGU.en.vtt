00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.080
 Kharkov 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329

 The US and Russian departments offered to accept 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.930
 measures to resolve the crisis in Ukraine 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.409
 for example, negotiate with 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.390
 four sides john kerry handed 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.729

 Kharkov Donetsk and Lugansk and Mariupol 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.960
 according to him they do not seem spontaneous 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.909
 but rather were carefully planned 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 Companies with the support of Russia 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.979
 and in the meantime in Kharkov are trying 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 go back to normal and already 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.340
 began to remove the traces of mass 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.689
 riots in the streets 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.070
 events in Ukraine west reaction 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.780
 discuss with the German deputy

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.640
 Nilsom she us 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.620
 mister annan how do you rate 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.890
 whether the situation in Ukraine does not resemble 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.840
 to you the Crimean script dbf 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.959
 we fear a similar situation 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.859
 may occur in the east of Ukraine 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.140
 Russian government called for 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.329
 Ukrainian authorities do not use violence in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.069
 respect to the demonstrators these statements 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.659
 Moscow can be perceived as support 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.060
 activists but it seems 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.459
 only a few thousand protesters 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.799
 This is not a popular uprising situation before 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.709
 still remains unclear . 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.420
 and how can the West contribute now 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.280
 in the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine as a whole 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.500
 and especially in the Crimea we made a number 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.900
 proposals, we contributed to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.450
 now independent works in Ukraine 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.970
 mission without consent from the Russian authorities 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.760
 in the last weeks we work 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.689
 over that between Moscow and Kiev 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.939
 direct dialogue has been established 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.609
 possible by forming contact 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.109
 groups this was just discussed by the state secretary 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.340
 usa john kerry with foreign minister 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.269
 Russian affairs 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.129
 planted seed stitches moscow judging 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.919
 around is not very committed to dialogue with 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.419
 Ukraine and the West have already adopted sanctions 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.549
 not very impressed with Russian 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.229
 leadership that follows west now 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.060
 do recognize the accession of Crimea to 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:28.299
 Russia or maybe the other way around enter 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.159
 tough economic sanctions but diogo 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.530
 pignon from me and on the mine 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.419
 the European Union has developed a unified position it 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.540
 very important moment we continue 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.090
 We will conduct a unified policy, we do not 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.099
 we recognize the annexation of the Crimea and we will not do 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.319
 it is in the future at the same time we 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.329
 We understand that peace and stability in Europe 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.120
 possible only when with Russia 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.579
 good relationship is built 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.069
 the door to negotiation is always open but 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.229
 if escalation grows further if 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.209
 destabilization will continue then not 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.310
 it is excluded that the third stage will take effect 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.620
 on the introduction of really painful 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.750
 economic sanctions we don't want that 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.410
 but we can not exclude the will nor Th 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.700
 th century did not go thanks mister on 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.740

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.510
 political analyst will need to do an analysis 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.360
 country destruction is the perfect example 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.760
 Russiaâ€™s actions against Ukraine 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.950

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.320
