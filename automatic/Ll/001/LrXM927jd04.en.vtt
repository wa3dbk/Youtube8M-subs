okay today I'm going to do a

00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.200 
okay today I'm going to do a
demonstration<00:00:01.410> on<00:00:01.860> scrapers<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.030> the

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
demonstration on scrapers this is the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.690 
demonstration on scrapers this is the
big<00:00:03.570> one<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.750> use<00:00:03.990> its<00:00:04.200> inch<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> half<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.370> I

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
big one I use its inch and a half and I

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.280 
big one I use its inch and a half and I
use<00:00:05.819> it<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.120> cleaned<00:00:06.420> up<00:00:06.569> on<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.960> tool<00:00:07.170> marks

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
use it for cleaned up on the tool marks

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.110 
use it for cleaned up on the tool marks
on<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> inside<00:00:07.890> up<00:00:08.280> bowls<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.760> stuff<00:00:08.880> like

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
on the inside up bowls and stuff like

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.580 
on the inside up bowls and stuff like
that<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.420> then<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:10.050> smaller<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.559> I

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
that and then this is my smaller one I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.589 
that and then this is my smaller one I
use<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.040> one<00:00:11.219> all<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.880> time<00:00:12.059> for<00:00:12.300> smaller

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
use this one all the time for smaller

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.670 
use this one all the time for smaller
stuff<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.740> actually<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.900> another<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.379> I

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
stuff I actually have another one that I

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.580 
stuff I actually have another one that I
use<00:00:17.010> used<00:00:17.850> sometimes<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.570> just<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.930> boxes<00:00:19.560> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
use used sometimes but just on boxes and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.370 
use used sometimes but just on boxes and
it<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> round<00:00:21.029> nose<00:00:21.210> scraper<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:22.350> a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
it was a round nose scraper that I got a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
it was a round nose scraper that I got a
long<00:00:22.680> time<00:00:22.980> ago<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.369> reground<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.180> flat<00:00:24.570> on

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
long time ago and I reground it flat on

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
long time ago and I reground it flat on
the<00:00:24.900> end<00:00:25.050> here<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.529> then<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> pulled<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> side

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the end here and then I pulled the side

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.870 
the end here and then I pulled the side
up<00:00:26.720> straight<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.260> use<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:29.070> boxes<00:00:29.670> I'll

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
up straight and I use it for boxes I'll

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.359 
up straight and I use it for boxes I'll
I'll<00:00:30.119> come<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.599> Center<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.650> pull<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> across

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
I'll come in Center and pull it across

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
I'll come in Center and pull it across
the<00:00:32.700> bottom<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> bottom<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.630> flat<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the bottom so the bottom is flat and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
the bottom so the bottom is flat and
then<00:00:34.469> pull<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> side<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.399> it's

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
then pull it up the side so it's

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.830 
then pull it up the side so it's
parallel<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> that's<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> only

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
parallel and that's really the only

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.770 
parallel and that's really the only
thing<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.320> use<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.390> I'll<00:00:39.480> show

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
thing I use that one for but I'll show

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
thing I use that one for but I'll show
you<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> sharpen<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.530> real<00:00:40.680> quick<00:00:40.920> it's

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you how to sharpen it real quick it's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
you how to sharpen it real quick it's
it's<00:00:42.030> pretty<00:00:42.270> simple<00:00:42.690> other<00:00:42.840> than<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it's pretty simple other than the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.270 
it's pretty simple other than the
parting<00:00:43.410> tool<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.739> probably<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> easiest

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
parting tool is probably the easiest

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.610 
parting tool is probably the easiest
tool<00:00:44.850> less<00:00:45.090> sharpen<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.289> I'll<00:00:46.410> show<00:00:46.590> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
tool less sharpen and then I'll show you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.340 
tool less sharpen and then I'll show you
how<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.670> works<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.270> then<00:00:48.480> I'll<00:00:48.719> do<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> little

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
how it works and then I'll do a little

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439 
how it works and then I'll do a little
bit<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.620> shear<00:00:49.800> cutting<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> -<00:00:50.579> okay

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
bit of shear cutting with it - okay

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
bit of shear cutting with it - okay
sharpen<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.230> set<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.920> platform<00:00:53.640> there

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
sharpen it just set your platform there

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.139 
sharpen it just set your platform there
to<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> angle<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> are

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:12.390 

why

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.560 

and<00:01:13.400> that's<00:01:13.640> it<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.670> then<00:01:19.880> again<00:01:20.149> for<00:01:20.509> the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
and that's it so and then again for the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.399 
and that's it so and then again for the
angle<00:01:21.460> thunder<00:01:22.460> scrapers

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
angle thunder scrapers

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.139 
angle thunder scrapers
they<00:01:25.130> range<00:01:25.430> between<00:01:25.610> I'd<00:01:26.479> say<00:01:26.840> 45<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:28.100> 70<00:01:28.880> is

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
they range between I'd say 45 and 70 is

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.539 
they range between I'd say 45 and 70 is
about<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.289> angle<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:30.979> want<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.220> keep<00:01:31.399> them

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
about the angle you want to keep them

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.620 
about the angle you want to keep them
this<00:01:31.970> one<00:01:32.149> right<00:01:32.270> here<00:01:32.570> is<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.960> 50<00:01:34.360> see<00:01:35.360> that

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
this one right here is it 50 see that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.539 
this one right here is it 50 see that
that's<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.649> quick<00:01:36.860> way<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.070> test<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.520> you

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
that's just a quick way to test it you

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.670 
that's just a quick way to test it you
can<00:01:37.789> test<00:01:38.000> any<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.630> your<00:01:38.750> tools<00:01:39.020> on<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:39.289> little

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
can test any of your tools on it little

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.029 
can test any of your tools on it little
gauge<00:01:39.920> like<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.869> big<00:01:42.200> one<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:42.470> can<00:01:42.770> we

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
gauge like this and the big one I can we

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.950 
gauge like this and the big one I can we
think<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.810> yeah<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.500> right<00:01:45.830> about<00:01:46.039> 70<00:01:46.960> and

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
think is yeah it's right about 70 and

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.300 
think is yeah it's right about 70 and
then<00:01:49.509> okay<00:01:50.509> and<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.319> generally<00:01:51.920> want<00:01:52.190> it

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
then okay and then generally want it

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.730 
then okay and then generally want it
want<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.060> cutter<00:01:53.390> head<00:01:53.600> just<00:01:53.990> above<00:01:54.170> Center

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
want the cutter head just above Center

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.590 
want the cutter head just above Center
you<00:01:55.549> don't<00:01:55.700> want<00:01:55.819> to<00:01:55.880> hold<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.119> tool<00:01:56.330> down

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
you don't want to hold the tool down

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.389 
you don't want to hold the tool down
like<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.560> are<00:01:57.619> cutting<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.280> the

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
like that but you are cutting on the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:10.490 
like that but you are cutting on the
burr<00:01:58.610> so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
