00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.820
 At the beginning yes 25 years rank degree is 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.199
 One year running from the middle to the middle ages is bad 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:16.339
 There was a unity in so-called defect 49 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.939
 The members of Cinderella on the beach are pretty 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.019
 There were no strangers in the area 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.560
 I entered Kawamura Gakuen from the back of my head 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.349
 I dropped one configuration on that occasion 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.130
 With a background of snakes, in the phase after the hard tree 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.370
 Certifier 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.300
 next 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 Contract term is 4 years 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.780
 Speaking from the same class as top speed feeling 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.760
 Sometimes 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.000
 It looks like a major ball 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.090
 * 1. 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.830
 Awkwardly 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.840
 This news comes into the school homepage 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.840
 The surrounding no longer listens 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 For a big weapon 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.970
 I wanted to hold a press conference 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.970
 It was firm 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.200
 I will not go to the party 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.970
 Financing funds 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.790
 Valuable research 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 I asked him again 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.300
 Tadashi Ito 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.570
 Anyway 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 It is when the entrance exam is on standby 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.460
 More convenient than anything 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 It will be this year 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.860
 That was bad 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.920
 Former reason that it does not continue alone so as to decrease this time 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.640
 Horse fat 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 It is also g1 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 4-4-2 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.390
 Is driving 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.640
 It's a pity I'm sorry 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.750
 55,000 people 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
 Another minute 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.139
 I understood 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.299
 It is like the first thing before the argument to the same 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 It is talks when I get caught 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.369
 It will enter the former Yankee procedure 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.889
 I can ignore it for the day I became a target of getting along 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.969
 Learn about once a month 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969
 I did not specify urgently for no reason 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.150
 End 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.669
 It was amazing 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.549
 Listener activation 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.549
 Deteriorated between carps 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.439
 listener 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.069
 Mie traffic restraint 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.369
 Takamatsu Tsuki Port 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.059
 For now 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.599
 wiredh 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.599
 married 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:18.029
 Realistic each equipment close 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.309
 Akagi Kunika 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.759
 I did this 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.759
 Maintaining a Headache 1 Loss 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.509
 This 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.029
 World's No. 1 manufacturer 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.689
 Addition work 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.779
 Even if it is price, it has become difficult 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 The radio wave condition is getting worse 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.049
 Worked around 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.369
 Writer 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.369
 It is said that Matsutomi came 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.509
 I was talking that I wanted to go home by chassis size 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.569
 There was also an indication that I was satisfied 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.069
 Because I made it 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.359
 -Toshimaen 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.919
 But Sakurai jbau mobile phone 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:12.779
 Not in recent years 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.779
 These pasoed 428 600 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.989
 I wondered what the monitor was 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.309
 It takes time for me 

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:25.309
 Certainly my figure is not found anywhere 2 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.729
 About 290 million yen 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.789
 It was caused by human error 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.179
 It must have been strong outside to hear abnormal noises all over the world 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 No way 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.020
 I did this time 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.020
 Good luck 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 It was gone 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.979
 The next delivery destination is the staff room 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.539
 Especially 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.529
 Seifukai 1123 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.569
 No weapon has been found 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.569
 43 or 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.559
 48 love messages 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.469
 Who is pointing out 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.539
 That is of course 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:29.680
 Please tell me 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.969
 Easy to see and expensive 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.599
 Because there is a local obligation 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.349
 I'm sorry 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:39.349
 Relatively expensive 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.159
 Still 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.650
 Mr. Abe, chairman of the Miyazawa referee 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.930
 I won while doing so 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.279
 It worsens from January 27 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.279
 Meeting result exceeded 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.110
 2235 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.110
 I'm really worried about the process 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.000
 I do not say the sender or name, but surprisingly from the country 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.339
 doing 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:05.389
 Like this 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.389
 I'll hit you 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.159
 sell 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:19.159
 Matsuzaka marks 10 wins 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.620
 The group smiles when the cause is not clear 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.620
 Google goog.o 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.219
 We get 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:33.219
 0700 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:35.509
 Something like this
