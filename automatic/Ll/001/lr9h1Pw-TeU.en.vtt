00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.540
 Hello everybody 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.600
 today I come to fuck Justin Bieber and his fucking music 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.989
 obvious is joke fuck good without more triangles let's go to the topic 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:17.550
 Surely you know what it is about by the name of the video but like them 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.570
 I will say for some clueless 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.500
 the gimmicks of the don console are not tricks of the plae and this and txomin and of 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.480
 nintendo 64 is about the pc console or that is that birds to put all the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.340
 puñeteros tricks and be the most novice of Don because he uses tricks 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.570
 what a disappointment 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.430
 good but before I'll put two little tricks that are not tricks but 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 I'll tell you some things 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.280
 okey macri 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.590
 First of all, get into hot chip spa custom and control yourself to be able to 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.820
 play or if you will not be more lost than the nice good lieutenant there says how 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.079
 shoot crouch jump etc ... if you have questions ask 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.239
 I do not feel like putting everything where it says maybe the field is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.210
 where you should have control so you can see in the third person and 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.570
 in houten console is to enter the console that I offerwise said before I 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.510
 I put the entity 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.560
 this is for bad taste options where it says enable manaus they put that 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 yes so that you can use the Mauser as you look and you can play like the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.780

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.159
