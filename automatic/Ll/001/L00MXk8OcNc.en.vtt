00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.700
 We are in the vicinity of 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.400
 supermarket reid etxániz and we saw a 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.080
 Disastrously grown puppy 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.919
 but we do not have a camera on top of it, so 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.780
 we are filming with the phone 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.900
 obviously he has a scabies we do not know 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 if it is optical arch or technical demo by 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.039
 so we are asking for help to see 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.880
 what we do with him and the fate that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.290
 will have to hopefully be the best 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.840
 the wrinkles we see is not that it's a 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.310
 be page but that scabies itself 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.559
 that the skin looks like this 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:42.449
 [Music] 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.140
 to the usual question we do not understand 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.149
 how people can leave 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.320
 to a dog and leave him in this state 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.930
 well, many times they leave it 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 just because they think scabies 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.460
 it is incurable as it is, it has no forgiveness 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.199
 There are many dogs that we find 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.270
 there are many friends who help us 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.920
 but that certainly really shame 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.440
 keep asking for help knowing the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.170
 situation that all the puppies are and 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.750
 also how are the hostels 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.480
 crammed with animals I think we have 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.160
 already on bus 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.290
 but in jérica he went to buy some 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.960
 towels to put it on the cart really 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.070
 at this time we were not ready 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 We went to buy some food 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.730
 but the puppies always cross us 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.670
 well that's it 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.350
 here is taking a little bit of water that 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.390
 is taking out the ice you see that its same 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.430
 state 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.110
 local cold makes me so good 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.450
 come is treated with the belt that pulls me out 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.870
 of the waist because we are prepared 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.570
 at this time to bring a dog 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.760
 we always do it but right today we do not 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.220
 we have no element above but 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.920
 Well, the main thing is the will 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.259
 and something we are going to do 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 it is expected that we are going to take it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
 let's bathe it in the first instance and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.510
 then make it attend to know what 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.310
 kind of skin care has 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.170
 but here that we are with bullying 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.360
 inside the car and we are 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.760
 bringing home a good 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.650
 bathroom but distance is to give him a meal 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.910
 so that he feels really comfortable and 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.910
 then we will see what to do 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.209
 It is imported 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.130
 and it shows that he was very tired look what 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.200
 We went up lay down and it's yours 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.300
 but as you will see we are not very elegant 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.410
 but this is so for growing better 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 as i said america in the end 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.110
 If you do not have a real name yet 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.780
 purpose we will hopefully have 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.450
 feel better with this nice that 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.530
 will be crusts and ticks that said 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.910
 have others after a healthy 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.160
 food and a well-deserved party we 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.500
 we directed the veterinarian who 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.020
 confirmed that this I saw had a mange 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.570
 modest and here and immediately started 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.490
 his treatment but over time 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.430
 we could notice that the health of this and 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.170
 had many ups and downs as soon as 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.180
 his character always showed a 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.880
 excellent attitude and good disposition 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 for learning without a doubt a dog 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.860
 very affectionate who enjoys the company 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.240
 human relapse into his health took us 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.220
 to admit him to the san foundation 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.730
 francisco de asís where the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.100
 eighth miracle to adopt I am because 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.280
 my son the smallest in the family 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.930
 I have three sons now with this 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.840
 I saw a son with my mom for me 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.420
 it's very proud to have this I saw as 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.109
 part of my family have it for sure 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.939
 that we're going to treat it super well 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.640
 We are going to love you a lot, we are going to encourage you 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.219
 much in itself we are already waiting for it 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.040
 at home with a welcome sign is 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.870
 still your new home as if the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.670
 I knew all my life 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.000
 tommy joined his new family 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.530
 where he finally found his place 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.530
 definitive in the world 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.780
 yes 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.110
 I do not know 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.509
