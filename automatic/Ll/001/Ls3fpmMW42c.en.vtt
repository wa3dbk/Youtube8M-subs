00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
timber frame and the thatch it wasn't

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.960 
timber frame and the thatch it wasn't
okay<00:05:09.919> so<00:05:09.979> it<00:05:10.130> wasn't<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.370> bamboo<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.850> was

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
okay so it wasn't a bamboo it was

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.240 
okay so it wasn't a bamboo it was
thatched<00:05:12.850> but<00:05:14.169> it's<00:05:15.169> pretty<00:05:15.380> cool<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.070> mean

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.040 
thatched but it's pretty cool and I mean
it<00:05:16.430> adds<00:05:16.669> a<00:05:16.880> lot<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.090> depth<00:05:17.390> to<00:05:17.450> Minecraft

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.500 

really<00:05:21.050> it's<00:05:21.950> a<00:05:22.220> lot<00:05:22.520> better<00:05:22.789> than<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.120> NPC

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510
