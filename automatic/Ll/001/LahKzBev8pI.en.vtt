00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.760 
move really really slow because
it's<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.480> prevents<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.410> from<00:02:13.470> doing

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's just it prevents you from doing

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's just it prevents you from doing
well<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.310> game<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.820> helps<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.210> with

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
well in this game it helps you with

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.880 
well in this game it helps you with
rushing<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.020> things<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.410> and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
rushing and things like that and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.890 
rushing and things like that and
mobility<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:18.000> really<00:02:18.300> important<00:02:18.780> especially

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
mobility is really important especially

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.110 
mobility is really important especially
with<00:02:19.350> these<00:02:19.440> maps<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:20.070> kind<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.910> got<00:02:21.090> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
with these maps you kind of you got a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
with these maps you kind of you got a
need<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.900> speed<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.350> this<00:02:22.500> game<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
need to the speed in this game you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.850 
need to the speed in this game you
really<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:23.850> that's<00:02:24.030> why<00:02:24.290> SMGs<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> assault

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
really do so that's why SMGs and assault

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
really do so that's why SMGs and assault
rifles<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:26.520> really<00:02:26.850> popular<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.600> game

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
rifles are really popular in this game

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.480 
rifles are really popular in this game
and<00:02:28.020> LMGs<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.160> rarely<00:02:29.550> see<00:02:31.070> they<00:02:32.070> even<00:02:32.370> get

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
and LMGs you rarely see they even get

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.630 
and LMGs you rarely see they even get
used<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.060> mean<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.480> cod4<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.770> would<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.130> the

game just to see you know how they

game just to see you know how they
affect<00:02:56.330> just<00:02:57.330> your<00:02:57.510> play<00:02:57.780> style<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.470> what<00:02:58.590> you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
have to do to actually do I guess decent

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.850 
have to do to actually do I guess decent
but<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.790> don't<00:03:03.780> know<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.990> just<00:03:04.020> it's<00:03:04.590> going<00:03:04.800> to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
but I don't know it just it's going to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.560 
but I don't know it just it's going to
vary<00:03:05.100> from<00:03:05.370> person<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.820> person<00:03:05.850> what<00:03:06.420> they

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
vary from person to person what they

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.470 
vary from person to person what they
prefer<00:03:06.960> what<00:03:07.230> they<00:03:07.350> like<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.090> i<00:03:09.210> said<00:03:09.240> i

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
prefer what they like but like i said i

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.470 
prefer what they like but like i said i
used<00:03:09.780> focus<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.620> grip<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:11.460> this<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:12.450> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
used focus and grip with this now you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.150 
used focus and grip with this now you
know<00:03:13.020> i<00:03:13.050> used<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.500> lot<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.800> different

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
know i used a lot of different

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160 
know i used a lot of different
attachments<00:03:14.850> i<00:03:14.940> even<00:03:15.150> used<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.900> two

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
attachments i even used the two

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.810 
attachments i even used the two
attachment<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.130> check<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.460> out<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.640> see

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
attachment just to check it out and see

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.810 
attachment just to check it out and see
what<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.210> would<00:03:18.330> no<00:03:19.050> effect<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.160> just

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
what it would no effect but it just

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.520 
what it would no effect but it just
seems<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.390> works<00:03:21.630> pretty<00:03:21.810> well<00:03:21.960> some

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
seems like this works pretty well some

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.160 
seems like this works pretty well some
people<00:03:22.770> say<00:03:22.920> rapid<00:03:23.340> fire<00:03:23.550> helps<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.240> I<00:03:24.300> i<00:03:24.780> find

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
people say rapid fire helps but I i find

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.550 
people say rapid fire helps but I i find
the<00:03:25.350> recoil<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.400> very<00:03:27.560> controllable

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the recoil is not very controllable

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.090 
the recoil is not very controllable
sometimes<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.550> random<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:31.740> kind<00:03:32.040> of

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
sometimes it's random and it kind of

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.070 
sometimes it's random and it kind of
sets<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.550> off<00:03:32.640> guard<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.360> you're<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:33.960> like

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
sets you off guard it you're just like

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.260 
sets you off guard it you're just like
what<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.410> heck<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:35.190> they<00:03:35.370> I'm<00:03:35.820> not<00:03:35.970> used<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
what the heck but they I'm not used to

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.120 
what the heck but they I'm not used to
that<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.750> you're<00:03:37.410> probably<00:03:37.620> used<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:37.980> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
that and you're probably used to you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.790 
that and you're probably used to you
know<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:38.460> assault<00:03:39.270> rifles<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.990> SMG<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.650> that

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
know like assault rifles and SMG is that

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.340 
know like assault rifles and SMG is that
have<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.460> miniscule<00:03:42.270> recoil<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.200> this

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
have really miniscule recoil in this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.860 
have really miniscule recoil in this
game<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.890> these<00:03:44.850> guys<00:03:45.120> they<00:03:45.390> really<00:03:45.660> don't

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
game and these guys they really don't

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.650 
game and these guys they really don't
but<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.500> think<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.310> used<00:03:47.520> steady<00:03:47.820> aim<00:03:48.060> hardline

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
but I think I used steady aim hardline

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.900 
but I think I used steady aim hardline
and<00:03:49.050> sleight<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.500> hand<00:03:49.800> from<00:03:50.070> our<00:03:50.220> perks<00:03:50.520> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
and sleight of hand from our perks and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.750 
and sleight of hand from our perks and
that's<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.960> pretty<00:03:52.140> good<00:03:52.350> perks<00:03:52.860> setup<00:03:53.340> you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
that's a pretty good perks setup you

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.090 
that's a pretty good perks setup you
could<00:03:53.910> probably<00:03:54.120> use<00:03:54.630> quick<00:03:55.350> draw<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:55.980> way

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
could probably use quick draw that way

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.100 
could probably use quick draw that way
you<00:03:56.160> could<00:03:56.460> 80s<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.210> little<00:03:57.480> bit<00:03:57.570> faster<00:03:57.750> of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
you could 80s a little bit faster of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.350 
you could 80s a little bit faster of
course<00:03:58.350> but<00:03:58.950> these<00:03:59.130> guns<00:03:59.400> they<00:03:59.670> they<00:04:00.180> have<00:04:00.330> a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
course but these guns they they have a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.290 
course but these guns they they have a
slow<00:04:00.660> 80s<00:04:01.110> time<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.980> with<00:04:02.460> everybody<00:04:02.730> running

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
slow 80s time and with everybody running

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.450 
slow 80s time and with everybody running
around<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.750> rushing<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.350> hip<00:04:04.500> firing<00:04:04.770> your

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
around and rushing and hip firing your

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.820 
around and rushing and hip firing your
best<00:04:05.910> option<00:04:06.300> will<00:04:06.480> probably<00:04:06.810> be<00:04:06.900> steady<00:04:07.620> aim

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
best option will probably be steady aim

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.460 
best option will probably be steady aim
and<00:04:08.160> quick<00:04:08.790> draw<00:04:09.030> but<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.510> used<00:04:09.750> hardline<00:04:10.170> just

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
and quick draw but I used hardline just

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.020 
and quick draw but I used hardline just
so<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.650> could<00:04:10.770> get<00:04:10.980> some<00:04:11.190> killstreaks<00:04:11.760> pretty

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
so I could get some killstreaks pretty

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.760 
so I could get some killstreaks pretty
quickly<00:04:12.300> got<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> nice<00:04:13.050> triple<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.740> game

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
quickly got a nice triple in the game

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.400 
quickly got a nice triple in the game
and<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.250> i<00:04:14.490> think<00:04:15.000> i<00:04:15.060> got<00:04:15.090> like<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.420> quad<00:04:15.930> which<00:04:16.260> is
