nowadays<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.460> kid<00:00:41.640> wants<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> be

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
nowadays I think the kid wants to be

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.380 
nowadays I think the kid wants to be
sure<00:00:42.780> when<00:00:43.050> he<00:00:43.140> made<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> huge<00:00:43.770> decision<00:00:44.360> but<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sure when he made a huge decision but I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
sure when he made a huge decision but I
fear<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.230> fact<00:00:46.469> he's<00:00:46.649> dwelling<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.280> long

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
fear that the fact he's dwelling so long

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.900 
fear that the fact he's dwelling so long
to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.230> may<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.559> get<00:00:49.739> him<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.070> think

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to do it that we may not get him I think

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.479 
to do it that we may not get him I think
the<00:00:51.000> remarks<00:00:51.420> made<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.410> he's<00:00:52.710> he<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> his

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the remarks made I think he's he and his

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.080 
the remarks made I think he's he and his
father<00:00:53.730> who<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> big<00:00:54.660> factor<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.940> a
