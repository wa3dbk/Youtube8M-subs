00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.299
 considered one of the most important 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.590
 volkswagen launches in brazil 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.990
 in this year 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.080
 the new sloop arrives with many advances 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.449
 more comfort a visual 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.939
 more robust and the desired version 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.130
 cabin extended everything to meet the 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.800
 consumer using a new pickup for the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.750
 work and for leisure two versions of 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680
 new sloop are available for the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.470
 consumer 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.730
 the basic 1.6 that can be equipped with the 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.320
 already known package trend and the 1.6 trooper 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.750
 both differ internally by 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.610
 colors and materials in the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.430
 trooper version for example there is a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.410
 console extension with coaster 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.430
 of a hood that covers the 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.340
 hand brake 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.710
 the extended cab of coatings 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.960
 rear columns include door objects 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.630
 on each side the internal area for 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.850
 baggage has been 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.910
 the single cabin version as extended 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.370
 has wheelbase 152 mm 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.920
 higher than the goal and the voyage in 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.810
 new axle gauges 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.400
 rear are also larger 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.370
 which allows an increase in the capacity 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.300
 load more space stability 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.460
 interior 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.610
 internally the vehicle is higher 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.410
 with more head and elbow room 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.080
 leaving occupant a higher position 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.060
 accessibility is also better 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.060
 due to the greater opening height of the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.159
 door to load the bucket is more 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.200
 long and wider because of the 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.750
 distance between the wheeled 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.840
 it is possible to accommodate wider loads 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.150
 an additional gain of 48 liters also 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.820
 was obtained by the new positioning of the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.159
 not smooth to move the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.050
 Steppe is a cable and pulley mechanism 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.080
 of steel driven by the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.180
 wheel after opening the tailgate 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.860
 so that the load is secured to points 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.159
 anchoring rails with hooks 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.740
 sliders for access to the steps in the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.899
 the steel level 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 open life cover is the same 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.569
 the cover also has a system of 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.629
 exclusive shock absorber 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.090
 the carrying capacity of 715 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.099
 kilos in the simple version and 700 kilograms 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.420
 extended cab version including 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.420
 driver and passenger 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.250
 all structural novelties reflect 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.049
 changes in design 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.450
 all the lines were designed to 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.969
 prioritize the vehicle's aerodynamics and 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.180
 thus making it even more economical and 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:42.370
 less polluting the result obtained after 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.459
 number of tests was a coefficient of 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 which is the best of the category 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.389
 resulting in lower consumption of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.129
 higher speed 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:56.349
 the extended version with marine top 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.599
 has a shape coefficient of 0.346 other 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.299
 concern of the Volkswagen team was 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.849
 quite characteristic backside 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.949
 on the sloop the design is simple with 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.620
 clear lines and no excesses 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:10.780
 the flashlights are the finest 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.840
 black light has two integrated lamps 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.000
 Bucket for lighting inside 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.189
 one of the unique highlights is the glass 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.079
 cantilever that optionally can 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.599
 be equipped with a sliding window 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.239
 which when closed remains the same 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.030
 surface of adjacent windows in a 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.280
 similar system as the European vans 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.090
 the new sloop equipped with the already 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.970
 known engine and the 111 1.6 liter vht 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.819
 total flex mounted transversely 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.790
 just like in the gol voyage polo in the new 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.040
 the engine that generates 104 horsepower 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.989
 power supplied to alcohol and 101 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.409
 horsepower stocked 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.000
 gasoline is still more efficient your 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.009
 performance was optimized by 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.099
 which has undergone adaptations in the 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:59.199
 their gear ratios the drive assembly 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.569
 and the exchange rate was calibrated for a pickup truck 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:04.269
 mixed use other feature 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.639
 relevant to the excellent touch and has 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.319
 power at lower revs the 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.560
 most commonly used in a routine of a 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.060
 work car to various equipment 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.879
 available, which further increase the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.549
 comfort on the new sloop between them is 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.310
 the exclusive parking sensor in the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.320
 category another optional unpublished in the 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.389
 segment of compact pickup trucks is the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.139
 adjustment of height and depth of 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.830
 steering wheel 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.900
 the antitheft system and applied to 14 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.389
 latest models launched by the brand in 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.090
 world is also an innovation 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.789
 between the technological options uai 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.069
 system with on-board computer display 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.259
 multimedia with information about the radio 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.090
 and the possibility of personalization of 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.599
 alerts such as speed or 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.120
 maintenance for the entertainment option

 the radio midi that besides these inputs 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.580
 also has input for cd with 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.340
