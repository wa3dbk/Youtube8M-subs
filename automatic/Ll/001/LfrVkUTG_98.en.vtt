00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.090
 two live in a world of the end one 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.740
 is increasingly feeling 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.180
 it is described as a preventable event 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.600
 but there is always a way to 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.310
 delay 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.600
 this is my destiny push back to the maximum 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.760
 this fateful date 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.760
 because I am the potato inspector 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.210
 ga fault more rigor is what 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.350
 once again it creepers 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.879
 threaten to blow up to central 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.140
 nuclear a virus is developed in 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.699
 the neighborhood of the poor the trickery 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.629
 cloakroom portrait at the bottom of June 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.520
 other discoveries 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.780
 no it's never happened twice 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.730
 the same disaster is the rule 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.780
 but this time it's a lot more 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.670
 serious but it could even prove 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.230
 uncontrollable and devastating the one the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.850
 troupe on time I never really 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.260
 understood why we continue the past 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.760
 a day to save several billion 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.829
 to be human never was 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.900
 rewarded never has anyone been 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.580
 recognized by once proposed forms 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.009
 there and I to moan is going to pick up by car 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.259
 so not this time look throw 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.729
 explained a block of corrupt dirt was 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.200
 detected somewhere on hand all 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.759
 contact with this block would result in a 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.170
 on top of huge crash until even 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.640
 to spit bigger mistake the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.869
 world thus causing the 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.729
 malfunction of any device 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.410
 electronics that end up in 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.979
 seconds that followed exploded nature to 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.450
 do together 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.470
 we must therefore prevent anyone 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:36.850
 to approach this blog 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:36.850
 and on the other hand in the face yeah we go 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.270
 the blocks together especially do not break 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:57.470
 not this area otherwise that's what it is 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.880
 I always dreamed of saying that ok and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.149
 that's a good thing done to 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.149
 the mistake
