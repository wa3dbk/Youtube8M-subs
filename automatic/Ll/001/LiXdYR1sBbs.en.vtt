00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.629
 It's the welcome here to another video. 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.519
 People look I'm inspired. 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.990
 I'm going to record another online diary if 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.190
 also from another day they are actually 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.190
 leaving this review was on the last 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.570
 I play there myself and I wanted to say 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.600
 for you why education is the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.199
 more fundamental than society. 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.320
 what we Brazil has to invest is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 education and I will say why else 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.469
 same reasoning of the last video as 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.320
 but the less ignorant we were 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.350
 more power of choice we will have 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 type if you have never tried a sealing one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.360
 little potty and the baby 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 you do not know what 's best but if 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.340
 You already tasted the two of you, you know. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.680
 can ability to choose what you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.079
 information and knowledge 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.190
 exactly this when you have 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 information 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.020
 you have the ability to choose what 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.170
 It is better and if you do not have information 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.700
 you have no choice you go 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.299
 let the other people choose to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.470
 you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 Okay, but people keep talking little and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.869
 have to invest in health have to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.090
 invest in health, Brazil has 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.380
 investing include transport has to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 get into transport 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 but the primordial thing that has to be 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.380
 invested in education because it is because 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 besides improving our political scenario 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.880
 certainly the people who are 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.280
 working they will have more capacity 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.189
 to exercise their work it so 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.520
 more efficient scientists do not have the 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.960
 ability to reinvent and discover 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.299
 more things more people will get 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.040
 interested in the science of education and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.159
 science are linked 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.740
 imagine with more scientists that you will have 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.630
 more innovation innovation is the key to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.689
 success of case progress 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.090
 imagine that 200 years ago and the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.579
 Brazil to Japan was almost impossible 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.390
 it took months 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.210
 they died 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.000
 nowadays the flood in less than two 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.910
 days 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.030
 One day you get on the plane and another day 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.370
 such expensive japan on the other side of the world 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.770
 Now, think what the fuck is that? 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.200
 But that's impossible, that was it and that's it. 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.880
 it was kind of impossible in the old days 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.350
 but what our human beings 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.130
 we made, we joined 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.390
 to study to research and we went 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.209
 develop technologies that we 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.580
 allowed and from Japan - one day and 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.459
 technologies that allow us to communicate 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.230
 for hundreds of people daily from the act 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.450
 I'm communicating for hundreds 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.550
 thousands of people in my room 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.340
 already stopped to think that crazy thing and 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.030
 this is impossible ten years ago does not bring 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.890
 dude this is impossible for ten years to such 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 what are the effects of these new 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.750
 technologies of these new innovations 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.030
 I do not let go of quality of life of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.300
 all human beings from survival 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.220
 of humans and does not improve the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.049
 give food we can eat 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.810
 imagine before there were 14 not 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.610
 existed for agricultural machinery 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.959
 it was difficult to feed many people 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.880
 now extends to have a population 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.820
 bigger 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.660
 just not the problem is that nowadays 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.060
 people are not focused on new 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.430
 technologies and in knowing things 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.370
 are focused on having more than others 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.570
 too damp sages they are focused 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.360
 finally has a more beautiful car are 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.730
 that the son has a 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.329
 last generation ok 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.630
 and they are not focused on discussing 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.370
 policies in knowing the best 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.510
 way to be taken in our 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.239
 civilization 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.090
 and that if it was not just one person was 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.040
 good but the political class that is the class 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.590
 that determines the path that people 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.360
 It does not matter either, man. 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.620
 I do not care about the development of 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.170
 new technologies 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.470
 We're all worried about the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.760
 Planet, it's fuck, a lot of people are going 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.909
 finish the food will end until 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.620
 She will appeal if I do not win 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:21.769
 think that Brazil is on the land and 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.220
 earth that the planet is in the universe 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.880
 with billions of new planets 1 billion 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.400
 of resources with millions of everything infinite 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.190
 until now nobody knows what the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.590
 extension and universe 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.380
 But we're limited here because 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.880
 we think traveling to space 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.169
 to save the planets is fiction 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.090
 scientific 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.639
 We think it's inventing spaceships. 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.820
 at or near lightning speed 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.669
 This is science fiction but I 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.630
 say one thing 200 years ago from the 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:03.530
 Brazil Japan and one day was fiction 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.500
 science is not impossible is not 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.410
 It is possible that we should only invest in this 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.960
 people have millions of people and 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.460
 every human being is able to contribute 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.620
 for this 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.330
 society is this nowadays but not 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.539
 It is as good as there are still people are 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.780
 progressing fast enough for me 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.240
 I just wanted to get this message out what kind 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.849
 worrying about 11 with what you have 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.539
 now what do you think you can 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.910
 worry can not create 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.470
 things that do not exist 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.210
 worry that there is a possibility 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.910
 that do not exist 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.919
 It's the same thing that you know there you are 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.180
 a person from the favela has no education 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.120
 and you think in one way 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.800
 get food or the cell phone is the 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.389
 stealing ok 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.610
 and there's that thought to steal 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.130
 steal because it's bad face to 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.320
 but you fail to see other 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.690
 possibilities will not say it all 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.320
 favelado is able to have a good 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.260
 education and 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.610
 And I have progressed. 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.360
 I have because of today's politics in 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.370
 day but without thinking of abobo 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.000
 stealing and start thinking about all we 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.620
 develop in the future to have 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.520
 possibilities more choices not only 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.030
 to steal 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.600
 ok if you think like this one would be the world 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.310
 huh 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.130
 today people want to catch the others 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.060
 Wanna build your own thing? 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.040
 wonderful 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.720
 good this message today at the Jamor 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.720
 fight for us
