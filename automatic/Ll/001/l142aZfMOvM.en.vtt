00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
slightly and then let's just open this

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.360 
slightly and then let's just open this
up<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:37.180> opens<00:03:37.570> like<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.770> will<00:03:39.010> fold

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
up so this opens like so it will fold

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.580 
up so this opens like so it will fold
all<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.850> way<00:03:40.030> around<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.720> back<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.440> your

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
all the way around the back of your

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.650 
all the way around the back of your
handsets<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.580> still<00:03:42.880> hold<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.209> normally

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
handsets you can still hold it normally

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.360 
handsets you can still hold it normally
just<00:03:44.230> protrudes<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.739> little<00:03:44.980> bit<00:03:45.100> at<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.280> top

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
just protrudes a little bit at the top

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.930 
just protrudes a little bit at the top
there<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:46.989> use<00:03:47.260> very<00:03:47.830> nice<00:03:48.100> there's<00:03:48.700> no

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
there but in use very nice there's no

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.940 
there but in use very nice there's no
raised<00:03:49.300> edge<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.200> if<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.530> did<00:03:50.650> put<00:03:50.830> your

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
raised edge so if you did put your

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.190 
raised edge so if you did put your
iPhone<00:03:51.370> down<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:52.330> screen<00:03:52.660> is<00:03:52.810> actually<00:03:53.110> going

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
iPhone down the screen is actually going

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.750 
iPhone down the screen is actually going
to<00:03:53.320> touch<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.800> surface<00:03:54.040> you're<00:03:54.400> putting<00:03:54.670> it

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
to touch the surface you're putting it

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.590 
to touch the surface you're putting it
on<00:03:54.880> but<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:56.140> fits<00:03:56.500> very<00:03:56.950> nicely<00:03:57.600> minimal

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
on but it fits very nicely minimal

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.449 
on but it fits very nicely minimal
protection<00:03:58.720> because<00:03:59.320> this<00:03:59.530> plastic<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.160> quite

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
protection because this plastic is quite

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.880 
protection because this plastic is quite
thin<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:01.390> does<00:04:01.600> feel<00:04:01.930> like<00:04:02.140> a<00:04:02.170> good<00:04:02.500> quality

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
thin it does feel like a good quality

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.340 
thin it does feel like a good quality
case<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.489> holding<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:03.940> like<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:05.080> doesn't

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
case and holding it like this it doesn't

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.040 
case and holding it like this it doesn't
really<00:04:05.739> get<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.220> way<00:04:06.400> at<00:04:06.940> all<00:04:07.000> takes<00:04:07.959> a
