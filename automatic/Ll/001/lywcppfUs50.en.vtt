00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.310
 in this tutorial we are going to see oa and that is the mode 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.530
 mode is a private platform for education 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:11.939
 it is a platform of more 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.759
 that allows to create a virtual space of communication in the classroom and outside it 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.669
 with the teaching staff and families 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.009
 in it you can share files messages links work calendar 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.929
 chores 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.220
 and it is managed from within 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.810
 let's see how it is done and how we can 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.920
 register them as teacher teachers 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 and then how can we register as a student 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.130
 for this we have to do was internet 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.470
 in the search engine we will write word mode 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.450
 here in this second option 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.450
 www dot dot mode 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.090
 we chop 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 we will go that we have accessed the main page 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.850
 of the platform 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.740
 at this time 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.060
 if we have never registered 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 we will have to register for free 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 explaining about the word teacher 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.070
 in doing so we find a drop-down 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700
 registered for teachers 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.900
 at 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.900
 we must complete username 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.160
 it is important to choose a user that originate 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.290
 if the chosen one already exists 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.830
 the platform not as sharp 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.530
 that's why it's interesting to put for example 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.530
 in it if we used to email 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 in this way it is also not so unknown 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.780
 the password 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.670
 and the nymex 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.900
 the title refers to 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.009
 a title 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.770
 this is courtesy 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.189
 because the link 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.330
 in translation 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.740
 of invex 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.330
 first name 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.520
 and last names and once we have completed the entire record 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.830
 we explain about the word 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 Sign up 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.799
 If we are already registered, it is not necessary to do 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.409
 the level the process that I just commented 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.010
 then enough to compose my username 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.219
 I do not have a predetermined 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.799
 i against five 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.099
 and clicking on the word enter we access directly to the platform 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.779
 I'm going out 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.559
 to see how you can register a student of a student 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:43.389
 would occur 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.549
 the same 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.209
 to register a student a canvas 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.109
 we must proceed in the same way 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.799
 so that if you never 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.419
 that has registered on the platform should d luis carlos arias word 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
 students 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.929
 we find a drop-down 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.419
 where we have to put the group code 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.079
 this code 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.129
 his professor has to always do his teacher 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.010
 and to get it previously the teacher will have created a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.809
 group 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.299
 of this topic we will talk in another tutorial 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.129
 then a month is written 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.109
 of user 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.149
 password 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.569
 per cent to email address this heading 

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.979
 so that there is no problem and there is no reason to put an end to the case 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.139
 the one student or one student 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.620
 since the platform 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.119
 allows me to communicate internally by email 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:42.989
 therefore it is not necessary 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.019
 the name of the pupil of the pupil and the experts and once we have 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.539
 completed this registration 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.539
 we sin on the word of gispert 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.519
 yes the student and student is already registered previously 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:00.620
 then we could 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.609
 the same 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.879
 could we the username 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.029
 percent thimble as well as the girl i 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.819
 the night or password we would explain about the word 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.229
 in theater 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.379
 In this way we have seen today how we can register on the platform
