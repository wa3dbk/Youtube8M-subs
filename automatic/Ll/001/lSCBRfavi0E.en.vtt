00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:09.640
 It is an exercise to improve control in this video 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.700
 And ask that you continue to introduce the method of practice of Sulo Ido 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.760
 I'm still using good numbers this time 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.300
 Using the web net 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.830
 So the service will become a video of what 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.950
 a 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.460
 this 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.510
 Practice by throwing to the place you actually aimed at by practicing 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.530
 is needed 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.800
 Because 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:37.150
 Please polish the ones that control to incorporate this practice by all means you can do it 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.100
 First of all, like a cardboard 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.870
 Well, if you have a partner who will practice with you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.870
 I do not wait for the ball 90 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.990
 It is the way of betting now that you can inage 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.950
 First of all, the graph 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.650
 It is a target aimed at straight 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.040
 In this video 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.040
 this 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.070
 The book is blue 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.610
 This mark part 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.270
 Or it 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.270
 Yellow mark 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.460
 I would like to create a window and loans to those who obtained the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.310
 The dough bets repurchase part of its target to shed the Fu and say, 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.460
 Gram 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.210
 I did not think 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.310
 I do not aim for May 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.549
 If you use a camera and aim 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.180
 Top obstinacy that is because align the pitching and is originally I'm going to cause a rating 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.420
 Mon dark falls of position temporary 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.680
 Because it is practice this time 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 Top of cases and also graph Sagena idea 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 Then 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.110
 Before those that say that the arm on him grab 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.880
 g 12 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.980
 Arm come to say 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.960
 It looks like a swimming crawl 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:04.350
 I'm bringing it here, but I'll take it back at that time 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.350
 There is one such practice insight with this 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.430
 When I change my arm, I play a grab and not g 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.080
 Then the ball runs toward the target part that the graph is targeting 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.250
 is 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.630
 The arms do not come to the same hair 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.030
 Of throwing go as get used to because it was aimed at the control and rather time I No such 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.030
 Do not let the things Te movement is doing it 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.400
 Be those around which said this is a chair 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.930
 Yes does not matter anything in quiz Suwarere if 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.590
 of 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.740
 Please prepare of science and mathematics, which said this because I think a little dangerous was sitting in Toka box 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.950
 I think that there is at first 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.950
 here we go 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.250
 Hey it wrapped in this thought here Te 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:57.010
 Birthplace of made was 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:03.250
 Lots of hey 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:06.670
 A sense of ball goes to the place aimed at the 0 It is the eyes of the minute frame the purpose of practice 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.640
 I will practice the transmission of nerves in the aircraft 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.380
 Because 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.380
 In fact, it is better to have a ball in the sound screen 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.959
 Become 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.740
 It's so easy it's a simple exercise 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.740
 Have the same league in the dark 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.100
 But say this is've blurred 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.100
 What will happen like this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.650
 There is no problem in particular 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.650
 It is not a practice 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.290
 Oh properly this time of practice Kedomo we have a 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.290
 Even if it is a type of letter that is originally used by hula 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.250
 Stick forward 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.690
 Sticking out in front 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.690
 Coming here 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.190
 As a point 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.510
 Aldeo 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.510
 It is to over divide firmly 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.690
 For stretcher 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.480
 This is not an actual throwing action 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:37.860
 It becomes practice to feed things with sense 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.100
 Control and things are very important things like movement and sense 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.610
 Also I think that you doing in addition to practice this exercise in some of such 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.610
 Thank you very much
