00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.910 

no<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.370> can't<00:04:36.610> really<00:04:36.760> reach<00:04:37.000> him<00:04:37.180> from<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
from the that was supposed to

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.500 
from the that was supposed to
happen<00:04:46.320> yeah<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.530> is<00:04:47.740> not<00:04:48.040> one<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.310> my<00:04:48.510> this

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.950 

turn<00:04:56.120> around<00:04:56.270> thank<00:04:56.930> you

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.080 

oh<00:05:01.020> come<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:01.919> that's<00:05:02.370> gay<00:05:04.699> you<00:05:05.699> were<00:05:05.819> right

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090

there

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:31.450 

uh<00:05:21.060> Bates<00:05:22.060> fight

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.270 

i<00:05:34.630> can<00:05:35.630> probably<00:05:35.930> get<00:05:36.199> a<00:05:36.259> better<00:05:36.319> angle<00:05:36.620> from

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
i can probably get a better angle from

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.309 
i can probably get a better angle from
this<00:05:37.520> side<00:05:38.919> come<00:05:39.919> back<00:05:40.099> up<00:05:40.690> there<00:05:41.690> we<00:05:42.110> go

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
this side come back up there we go

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.610 
this side come back up there we go
finally<00:05:42.710> I<00:05:44.169> don't<00:05:45.169> know<00:05:45.229> why<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:45.470> always

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
finally I don't know why I always

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.409 
finally I don't know why I always
struggle<00:05:46.190> with<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.400> last<00:05:46.669> hit<00:05:46.789> but<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.180> just

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
struggle with that last hit but I just

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.950 
struggle with that last hit but I just
do<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:48.880> guess<00:05:49.880> that's<00:05:50.030> a<00:05:50.180> reason<00:05:50.479> why<00:05:50.599> get<00:05:50.840> into

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
do I guess that's a reason why get into

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.719 
do I guess that's a reason why get into
a<00:05:51.050> missile<00:05:51.440> shortest<00:05:51.860> episode<00:05:52.340> would<00:05:52.490> take

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
a missile shortest episode would take

00:05:52.729 --> 00:06:00.089 
a missile shortest episode would take
forever<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:57.280> there<00:05:58.280> is<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.550> last<00:05:59.150> star<00:05:59.720> of

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
forever and there is the last star of

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:12.830 
forever and there is the last star of
honey<00:06:01.099> hive<00:06:01.400> galaxy

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.360 

that<00:06:13.840> makes<00:06:14.050> eight<00:06:14.319> stars<00:06:14.680> which<00:06:15.009> is<00:06:15.130> enough

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
that makes eight stars which is enough

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.170 
that makes eight stars which is enough
to<00:06:15.400> get<00:06:15.699> into<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.509> enemy<00:06:16.900> base<00:06:17.110> in<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.710> area

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
to get into the enemy base in the area

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.129 
to get into the enemy base in the area
and<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:21.280> opens<00:06:21.669> up<00:06:21.789> the<00:06:21.970> last<00:06:22.150> galaxy<00:06:22.840> in

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
and that opens up the last galaxy in

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.830 
and that opens up the last galaxy in
there<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:24.099> enemy<00:06:24.520> base<00:06:24.669> is<00:06:24.940> even<00:06:25.240> considered

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
there the enemy base is even considered

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.550 
there the enemy base is even considered
a<00:06:25.870> galaxy<00:06:29.610> so<00:06:30.610> next<00:06:30.970> time<00:06:31.330> I'm<00:06:31.840> going<00:06:32.470> to

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
a galaxy so next time I'm going to

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.730 
a galaxy so next time I'm going to
tackle<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:33.099> other<00:06:34.139> bonus<00:06:35.139> galaxies<00:06:35.620> in<00:06:35.710> the

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
tackle the other bonus galaxies in the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.160 
tackle the other bonus galaxies in the
terrace
