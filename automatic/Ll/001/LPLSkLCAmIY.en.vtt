that kind of stuff we went through
probably<00:01:04.489> about<00:01:04.640> four<00:01:05.150> or<00:01:05.180> five<00:01:05.390> stages<00:01:06.320> of

one<00:01:16.340> of<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.520> secret<00:01:17.060> sauce<00:01:17.570> elements<00:01:18.200> of

one of the secret sauce elements of

one of the secret sauce elements of
break<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.650> we've<00:01:19.100> really<00:01:19.760> nailed<00:01:20.090> controls

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
break is we've really nailed controls

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.830 
break is we've really nailed controls
the<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.159> works<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.579> you'll<00:01:24.179> run<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.749> at

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the way it works is you'll run at at

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.380 
the way it works is you'll run at at
obstacle<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> hold<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> smart

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
obstacle and if you hold down the smart

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749 
obstacle and if you hold down the smart
button<00:01:27.630> you'll<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:29.009> launched<00:01:29.520> over

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
button you'll actually be launched over

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.029 
button you'll actually be launched over
it<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.929> completely<00:01:31.289> smooth<00:01:31.829> when

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
it and it will completely smooth when

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.940 
it and it will completely smooth when
you<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.429> and<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.109> aim<00:01:34.229> low<00:01:34.560> you'll

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you do it and if you aim low you'll

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.270 
you do it and if you aim low you'll
slide<00:01:35.340> underneath<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:37.619> smart<00:01:37.890> system

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
slide underneath it the smart system

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.190 
slide underneath it the smart system
really<00:01:38.880> does<00:01:39.060> impact<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.659> way<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.840> design

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
really does impact the way you design

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.770 
really does impact the way you design
spaces<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:42.030> sort<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> look<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
spaces you sort of have to look at the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.889 
spaces you sort of have to look at the
spaces<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> whole<00:01:43.500> different<00:01:43.859> way<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
spaces a whole different way when the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
spaces a whole different way when the
level<00:01:46.380> designers<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:46.979> together<00:01:47.250> levels

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
level designers put together levels

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.870 
level designers put together levels
they're<00:01:48.479> very<00:01:48.869> careful<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.740> make<00:01:50.549> sure<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
they're very careful to make sure that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.669 
they're very careful to make sure that
anything<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.079> implies

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
anything they put in there which implies

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.010 
anything they put in there which implies
some<00:01:53.429> form<00:01:53.459> of<00:01:53.789> interaction<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.810> does

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
some form of interaction actually does

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.169 
some form of interaction actually does
that<00:01:55.229> thing<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.429> doesn't<00:01:56.789> they<00:01:57.000> won't

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
that thing and if it doesn't they won't

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.510 
that thing and if it doesn't they won't
put<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.689> first<00:01:57.899> place<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:59.039> us<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
put it in the first place for us and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
put it in the first place for us and
brink<00:01:59.879> is<00:02:00.090> looking<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.629> at<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> environment

brink is looking more at the environment

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
brink is looking more at the environment
like<00:02:01.379> you<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.039> real<00:02:02.280> environment<00:02:02.640> just

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
like you would a real environment just

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.669 
like you would a real environment just
opens<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.200> million<00:02:04.530> different

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
opens up like a million different

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.410 
opens up like a million different
possibilities<00:02:05.429> really<00:02:05.640> would<00:02:05.879> happen<00:02:06.179> in<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
possibilities really would happen in a

possibilities really would happen in a
level<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:09.079> guess<00:02:10.079> what<00:02:10.229> I'm<00:02:10.319> most<00:02:10.769> proud<00:02:11.039> about

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
level I guess what I'm most proud about

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.100 
level I guess what I'm most proud about
with<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.819> smart<00:02:12.090> button<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.930> really
