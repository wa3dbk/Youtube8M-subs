00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.719
 ah 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.590
 one 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.830
 one 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.490
 the projection device that has 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.380
 found mai this indicates that in king 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.590
 that there are two other artifacts like that of 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.570
 hangar now these artifacts are the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.490
 Sjl and spatial duct ends 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.579
 which keeps physically connected to the 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.090
 infinity with requiem yes 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.280
 we can disable them the infinity could 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 move 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 commander palmer let's send the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 deactivation codes needed to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.280
 this team will take care of the first 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 roland artifact sends the second 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.930
 coordinates to the assault team 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.930
 permissive 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 commander 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.689
 their capital gardens are not attacking 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.689
 they are entering the space 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.970
 I do not like this 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.540
 when we move 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.270
 we are not moving is requiem 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.290
 the ducts of the artifact are 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.290
 pulling the infinite 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.190
 towards the sun you have to find 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.620
 the artifacts so that the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.620
 infinite then to move spartan 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.730
 healthy as steam rikin here starts to 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.730
 make a lot of heat 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:32.049
 It's costing us for fame 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.049
 tell him later 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.190
 tÃ©lam 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.500
 disconnected artifact let's get out of here 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.990
 is levitating captain try now 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.770
 James works 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.770
 we're free 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.790
 we are almost fixed to see who is 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.790
 opposite commander what is 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.200
 all on board Lieutenant take them out of 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.200
 here yes sir 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.610
 ah 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.090
 emergency jump completed captain 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.160
 there are wounded in several covers but 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.169
 No significant downside was 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.169
 crew we get it 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.530
 you sent them to stop me 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.830
 I sent them to rescue hauchÃ© which is 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.830
 the difference 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.419
 doctor who has 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.390
 well the first test indicates that it is 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.080
 inert but 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.750
 and this is nothing 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.930
 at the molecular level 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.520
 it's incomplete 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.300
 it does not make sense 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.430
 it's like 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.430
 as if we only saw half 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.869
 yes 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.199
 I did not know that my compatriots were coming to 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:31.480
 assassinate me not to rescue me you either 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.410
 you have tried too well 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.410
 a place 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.610
 the ong has tried to execute me 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.890
 so if you want me to help you go to 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.890
 need more than just threats 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.130
 it's simple me 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.750
 I want revenge
