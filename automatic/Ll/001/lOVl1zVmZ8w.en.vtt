machine repair video apologies again to

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.270 
machine repair video apologies again to
my<00:00:05.100> arcade<00:00:06.000> fans<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.710> this<00:00:07.710> needs<00:00:07.919> fixing

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
my arcade fans but this needs fixing

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.350 
my arcade fans but this needs fixing
I'll<00:00:08.429> need<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.820> film<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.860> right<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.360> what's

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
I'll need to film it right so what's

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.759 
I'll need to film it right so what's
happened<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> machines<00:00:13.380> stopped

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
happened is the machines stopped

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.589 
happened is the machines stopped
spinning<00:00:14.070> at<00:00:14.400> all<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:14.849> there's<00:00:14.969> no<00:00:15.059> rotation

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
spinning at all so there's no rotation

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.740 
spinning at all so there's no rotation
on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> drum<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.730> when<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.910> happens<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
on the drum and when that happens the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.179 
on the drum and when that happens the
first<00:00:18.960> thing<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.140> usually<00:00:19.289> suspect<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> motor

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
first thing I usually suspect is a motor

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.759 
first thing I usually suspect is a motor
so<00:00:20.640> basically<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.750> motor<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.170> located<00:00:22.619> down

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so basically the motor was located down

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.220 
so basically the motor was located down
here<00:00:22.800> that's<00:00:23.640> unbolt<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.359> two<00:00:24.660> bolts<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.140> you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
here that's unbolt it two bolts as you

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.160 
here that's unbolt it two bolts as you
can<00:00:25.320> see<00:00:25.439> there<00:00:25.619> two<00:00:25.890> silver<00:00:26.189> bolts<00:00:26.430> there<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
can see there two silver bolts there and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.769 
can see there two silver bolts there and
this<00:00:28.170> connects<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.980> connector<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this connects this connector here and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.600 
this connects this connector here and
then<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.470> comes<00:00:31.679> slides<00:00:32.009> out<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:34.829> his

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then it just comes slides out and his

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.170 
then it just comes slides out and his
motor<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> quite<00:00:38.160> common<00:00:38.430> well<00:00:38.850> if<00:00:39.030> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
motor now it's quite common well if you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.729 
motor now it's quite common well if you
have<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> machine<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> few<00:00:40.140> years<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
have the machine for a few years it's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.959 
have the machine for a few years it's
what's<00:00:40.920> been<00:00:41.100> used<00:00:41.370> quite<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
what's been used quite a bit for the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.389 
what's been used quite a bit for the
brushes<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.450> wear<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.160> first<00:00:44.160> thing<00:00:44.340> I'm

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
brushes to wear out so first thing I'm

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
brushes to wear out so first thing I'm
going<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.030> check<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> brushes<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.230> I'm

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
going to do is check the brushes now I'm

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
going to do is check the brushes now I'm
ready<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.100> taking<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> screws<00:00:47.670> as

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
ready to take just taking the screws as

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.930 
ready to take just taking the screws as
you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.920> brush<00:00:54.140> okay<00:00:55.170> now

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
you can see and here is a brush okay now

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.599 
you can see and here is a brush okay now
on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.270> brush<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.930> carbon<00:00:58.379> part<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
on the brush the carbon part here is

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.459 
on the brush the carbon part here is
spring-loaded<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.079> needs<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> be

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
spring-loaded and that needs to be

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
spring-loaded and that needs to be
pushing<00:01:02.039> some<00:01:02.190> tension<00:01:02.699> against<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
pushing some tension against the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.590 
pushing some tension against the
armature<00:01:03.600> inside<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.540> put

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
armature inside there so if we just put

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.550 
armature inside there so if we just put
up<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.930> con<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> sec<00:01:08.750> now<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.020> brush<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
up a con a sec now when the brush is in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.460 
up a con a sec now when the brush is in
position<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.260> pressing<00:01:13.260> against

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
position if it's not pressing against

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.810 
position if it's not pressing against
them<00:01:13.710> personally<00:01:13.740> any<00:01:14.250> spring<00:01:14.549> pressure

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
them personally any spring pressure

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
them personally any spring pressure
which<00:01:15.090> isn't<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> line<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
which isn't as I see if I line up the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.550 
which isn't as I see if I line up the
holes<00:01:16.860> without<00:01:17.369> any<00:01:17.670> pressure<00:01:18.320> then<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
holes without any pressure then that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.190 
holes without any pressure then that
means<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.950> basically<00:01:20.070> warm<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
means it's basically warm down to the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
means it's basically warm down to the
point<00:01:22.409> where<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> no<00:01:23.189> longer<00:01:23.490> touch<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
point where it can no longer touch the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.660 
point where it can no longer touch the
armature<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.900> needs<00:01:25.020> replacing<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
armature so that needs replacing so I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.120 
armature so that needs replacing so I
need<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> screws<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:28.189> then

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
need to do is take the screws out then

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.170 
need to do is take the screws out then
get<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.280> hands<00:01:32.460> absolutely<00:01:32.670> filthy

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
get your hands absolutely filthy

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600 
get your hands absolutely filthy
torching<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.560> all<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> brush<00:01:35.310> wears

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
torching these so all the brush wears

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
torching these so all the brush wears
down<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.180> turns<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.659> dose<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.860> lots

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
down in turns the dose and you get lots

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.560 
down in turns the dose and you get lots
of<00:01:38.070> dust<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> floor<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.360> clean

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of dust in the floor and now to clean

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.649 
of dust in the floor and now to clean
that<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.170> well<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:41.329> think<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.570> just

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that all out as well I think it's just

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.090 
that all out as well I think it's just
slides<00:01:43.020> off<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.590> only<00:01:44.130> use<00:01:44.430> two<00:01:44.579> hands<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
slides off I only use two hands for this

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
slides off I only use two hands for this
that's<00:01:47.100> our<00:01:47.340> deal<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> minute<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that's our deal in a minute I see it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.480 
that's our deal in a minute I see it
basically<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.049> take<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> off<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
basically just take that off and and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.880 
basically just take that off and and
aldi<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.659> play<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.229> brushes<00:01:52.439> making

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
aldi on you play some brushes making

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.990 
aldi on you play some brushes making
sure<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.579> ones<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.850> your

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
sure to get the right ones for your

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
sure to get the right ones for your
model<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> sometimes<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> need<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> check

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
model and sometimes you need to check

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.959 
model and sometimes you need to check
the<00:01:56.729> model<00:01:57.329> number<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.140> motor<00:01:58.969> somewhere

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
the model number of the motor somewhere

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.600 
the model number of the motor somewhere
just<00:02:00.869> make<00:02:01.079> sure<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.890> case<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.280> model

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
just make sure it's in case your model

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.859 
just make sure it's in case your model
of<00:02:02.670> washing<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.060> had<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.390> two<00:02:03.509> different

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
of washing you had one or two different

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.569 
of washing you had one or two different
what<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> different<00:02:04.799> versions<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> motor

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
what the different versions of the motor

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.529 
what the different versions of the motor
and<00:02:07.250> before<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.369> go<00:02:08.520> fitting<00:02:08.879> any<00:02:09.030> new<00:02:09.209> brushes

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and before we go fitting any new brushes

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
and before we go fitting any new brushes
we<00:02:09.840> need<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.140> clean<00:02:10.379> up<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> armature

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
we need to clean up the armature

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.949 
we need to clean up the armature
that's<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> armature<00:02:12.120> there

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
that's the armature there

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.839 
that's the armature there
inside<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.769> motor<00:02:13.950> where<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.489> brushes

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
inside the motor where the brushes

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.460 
inside the motor where the brushes
brushes<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.900> they<00:02:15.959> push<00:02:16.170> against

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
brushes go here and they push against

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.410 
brushes go here and they push against
this<00:02:16.650> armature<00:02:16.980> now<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.790> that's<00:02:17.940> colored<00:02:18.299> in

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
this armature now so that's colored in

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.660 
this armature now so that's colored in
black<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:20.099> black<00:02:20.580> dust<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.920> which<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.489> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
black the black dust and which if you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.920 
black the black dust and which if you
don't<00:02:23.849> clean<00:02:24.090> off<00:02:24.269> basically<00:02:24.690> what<00:02:24.810> can

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
don't clean off basically what can

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.930 
don't clean off basically what can
happen<00:02:25.049> as<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.379> starts<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.739> are<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.310> actually

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
happen as it starts to are can actually

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
happen as it starts to are can actually
burn<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.360> brushes<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.810> wear<00:02:27.989> down<00:02:28.290> quicker

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
burn the brushes and wear down quicker

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.780 
burn the brushes and wear down quicker
so<00:02:29.340> what<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.090> use<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.930> first<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.799> all<00:02:31.860> little

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
so what I use is first of all little

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.580 
so what I use is first of all little
brush<00:02:33.000> brush<00:02:33.659> off<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.019> much<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.440> can

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
brush brush off as much as you can

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.960 
brush brush off as much as you can
spinning<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.190> know<00:02:35.280> obviously<00:02:35.610> spin<00:02:35.849> them

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
spinning you know obviously spin them

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.039 
spinning you know obviously spin them
around<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.480> make<00:02:36.599> sure<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.810> all<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.989> way

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
around to make sure that all the way

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.500 
around to make sure that all the way
around<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.349> armature<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.120> then<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.150> use

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
around the armature and then I use

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.059 
around the armature and then I use
isopropyl<00:02:40.379> alcohol

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
isopropyl alcohol

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.880 
isopropyl alcohol
now<00:02:41.730> let's<00:02:42.269> dip<00:02:42.540> some<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.079> and<00:02:43.349> give<00:02:43.860> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
now let's dip some that in and give it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.039 
now let's dip some that in and give it
brush<00:02:44.159> and<00:02:44.400> then<00:02:44.489> dry<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.760> off<00:02:44.910> with<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> rag<00:02:45.840> off

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
brush and then dry it off with a rag off

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.190 
brush and then dry it off with a rag off
some<00:02:46.560> kitchen<00:02:46.950> roll<00:02:46.980> anything<00:02:47.670> like<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
some kitchen roll anything like that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.360 
some kitchen roll anything like that
it's<00:02:49.200> never<00:02:49.379> gonna<00:02:49.560> look<00:02:49.620> perfectly<00:02:50.160> clean

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it's never gonna look perfectly clean

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.729 
it's not going to our can burn and waste
the<00:02:58.470> brushes<00:02:59.390> it<00:03:00.390> doesn't<00:03:00.780> want<00:03:00.870> much<00:03:01.049> cleaner

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
the brushes it doesn't want much cleaner

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.039 
the brushes it doesn't want much cleaner
on<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> camera<00:03:02.489> or<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.180> certainly<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.810> that

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
on the camera or it certainly is that

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.509 
on the camera or it certainly is that
much<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.349> remove<00:03:04.560> lots<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:04.980> lots<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.220> carbon

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
much to remove lots and lots of carbon

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.069 
much to remove lots and lots of carbon
buildup<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.150> was<00:03:06.269> trapped<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.690> between<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
buildup that was trapped in between the

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.869 
buildup that was trapped in between the
grooves<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> other<00:03:07.709> chair<00:03:07.950> now<00:03:08.579> I'm

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
grooves in the other chair now I'm

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.369 
grooves in the other chair now I'm
actually<00:03:09.060> ready<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.540> start<00:03:09.750> mounting<00:03:10.109> the

original brushes make sure to get the
original<00:03:15.239> ones<00:03:15.629> they<00:03:15.780> literally<00:03:16.079> maybe

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
original ones they literally maybe

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.620 
original ones they literally maybe
five-pound<00:03:17.549> more<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:17.970> several<00:03:18.269> regionals

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
five-pound more for several regionals

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.270 
five-pound more for several regionals
but<00:03:18.780> they<00:03:18.900> last<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.380> lot<00:03:19.650> longer<00:03:19.709> than<00:03:20.099> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
but they last a lot longer than the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.800 
but they last a lot longer than the
cheap<00:03:20.489> copies<00:03:20.849> I<00:03:20.880> have<00:03:21.180> tried<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.630> cheap

released the Commons the actual car

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.699 
released the Commons the actual car
brush<00:04:12.930> now<00:04:13.109> which<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.410> spring<00:04:13.680> loaded

brush now which is spring loaded
something<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:15.019> you've<00:04:16.019> got<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.169> beveled

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
something and you've got this beveled

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.170 
something and you've got this beveled
pot<00:04:16.859> on<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.130> now<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.310> need<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.639> line<00:04:17.849> them<00:04:18.000> off

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
pot on it now you need to line them off

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.789 
pot on it now you need to line them off
there's<00:04:18.479> no<00:04:18.599> repair<00:04:18.930> upper<00:04:19.349> left<00:04:19.530> or<00:04:19.680> right

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
there's no repair upper left or right

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.370 
there's no repair upper left or right
very<00:04:20.099> slightly<00:04:20.519> up<00:04:20.699> so<00:04:20.789> that<00:04:21.599> when<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:22.229> is

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
very slightly up so that when this is

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.290 
very slightly up so that when this is
the<00:04:22.500> way<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.650> mountains<00:04:23.010> this<00:04:23.159> way<00:04:23.340> when<00:04:24.150> it

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
the way it mountains this way when it

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.110 
the way it mountains this way when it
lines<00:04:24.719> up<00:04:24.990> with<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.200> armature

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
lines up with the armature

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.300 
lines up with the armature
that<00:04:26.630> beveled<00:04:27.290> sighs<00:04:27.500> basically<00:04:27.949> pushing

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
that beveled sighs basically pushing

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.370 
that beveled sighs basically pushing
flat<00:04:28.580> against<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:28.970> armature<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:29.960> is<00:04:30.320> a

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
flat against the armature so that is a

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.000 
flat against the armature so that is a
correct<00:04:30.770> way<00:04:30.830> around<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.190> do<00:04:31.250> it<00:04:32.410> also<00:04:33.410> fitting

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
correct way around to do it also fitting

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.189 
correct way around to do it also fitting
wire<00:04:34.220> it's<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.970> push<00:04:35.180> on<00:04:35.360> terminal<00:04:35.810> goes<00:04:36.050> on

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
wire it's a push on terminal goes on

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.980 
wire it's a push on terminal goes on
straight<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:37.040> then<00:04:37.729> we<00:04:38.419> need<00:04:38.570> to<00:04:38.720> bend

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
straight like that then we need to bend

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.310 
straight like that then we need to bend
the<00:04:39.940> terminal<00:04:40.940> like<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.360> then<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:41.900> piece

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
the terminal like so then this piece

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.070 
the terminal like so then this piece
will<00:04:42.530> click<00:04:42.830> into<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.250> housing<00:04:44.080> obviously

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
will click into the housing obviously

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.110 
will click into the housing obviously
there's<00:04:45.590> two<00:04:45.830> Clips<00:04:46.100> there<00:04:46.310> not<00:04:46.639> which<00:04:46.880> is<00:04:47.000> in

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
there's two Clips there not which is in

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.830 
there's two Clips there not which is in
there<00:04:47.300> that's<00:04:47.600> how<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:48.050> now<00:04:48.949> you've<00:04:49.250> got<00:04:49.400> to

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
there that's how you now you've got to

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.110 
there that's how you now you've got to
well<00:04:53.680> okay<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:54.710> that's<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.340> two<00:04:55.820> brushes

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
well okay so that's the two brushes

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.779 
well okay so that's the two brushes
fitted<00:04:56.830> it's<00:04:57.830> just<00:04:57.979> basically<00:04:58.190> case<00:04:58.490> to<00:04:58.610> screw

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
fitted it's just basically case to screw

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.790 
fitted it's just basically case to screw
in<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:58.970> back<00:04:59.120> down<00:04:59.360> be<00:04:59.810> careful<00:05:00.020> not<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.500> drop

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
in and back down be careful not to drop

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.680 
in and back down be careful not to drop
screws<00:05:01.160> inside<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.760> motor<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.330> shall<00:05:02.510> have

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
screws inside the motor and I shall have

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.219 
screws inside the motor and I shall have
fun<00:05:02.900> trying<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.199> get<00:05:03.380> them<00:05:03.530> out<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:05.080> one<00:05:06.080> thing

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
fun trying to get them out and one thing

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.570 
fun trying to get them out and one thing
I<00:05:06.289> just<00:05:06.320> thought<00:05:06.590> of<00:05:06.800> actually<00:05:06.979> was<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.430> might

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
I just thought of actually was it might

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.550 
I just thought of actually was it might
be<00:05:07.699> a<00:05:07.729> good<00:05:08.000> idea<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.419> leave<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.810> plastic<00:05:09.380> tabs

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
be a good idea to leave the plastic tabs

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.900 
be a good idea to leave the plastic tabs
on<00:05:09.740> till<00:05:09.919> last<00:05:10.039> minute<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.490> could<00:05:10.669> put<00:05:10.820> the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
on till last minute so I could put the

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.480 
on till last minute so I could put the
brush<00:05:11.090> in<00:05:11.350> screw<00:05:12.350> it<00:05:12.410> down<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.770> then<00:05:12.919> break

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
brush in screw it down and then break

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.430 
brush in screw it down and then break
off<00:05:13.639> the<00:05:13.789> tab<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.150> then<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.510> brush<00:05:15.260> was

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
off the tab and then the brush was

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.379 
off the tab and then the brush was
released<00:05:15.800> I'm<00:05:16.039> not<00:05:16.850> sure<00:05:16.970> if<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.120> actually<00:05:17.210> be

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
released I'm not sure if it actually be

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.939 
released I'm not sure if it actually be
easy<00:05:17.539> or<00:05:17.690> not<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:17.930> get<00:05:18.050> in<00:05:18.169> there<00:05:18.320> ste<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.710> tab

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
easy or not to get in there ste the tab

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.909 
easy or not to get in there ste the tab
and<00:05:19.389> well<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.630> obviously<00:05:21.199> wrote<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.650> times<00:05:21.800> of

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
and well I obviously wrote the times of

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.969 
and well I obviously wrote the times of
Hurley<00:05:22.070> as<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.340> saw<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:23.590> so<00:05:24.590> we'll<00:05:24.770> just<00:05:24.889> to

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
Hurley as you saw and so we'll just to

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.020 
Hurley as you saw and so we'll just to
do<00:05:25.100> is<00:05:25.190> basically<00:05:25.340> push<00:05:25.639> it<00:05:25.729> down<00:05:25.850> your

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
do is basically push it down your

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.210 
do is basically push it down your
fingers<00:05:26.389> squash<00:05:26.660> it<00:05:26.780> down<00:05:26.919> place<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.070> brush

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
fingers squash it down place the brush

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.219 
fingers squash it down place the brush
in<00:05:28.400> place<00:05:28.729> and<00:05:29.180> then<00:05:29.300> screw<00:05:29.750> a<00:05:29.780> screw<00:05:29.870> in

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
in place and then screw a screw in

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.200 
in place and then screw a screw in
finish<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.740> then<00:05:30.979> release<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.460> brush<00:05:31.669> it

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
finish it and then release the brush it

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.020 
finish it and then release the brush it
was<00:05:32.300> easy<00:05:32.510> enough<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.780> do<00:05:32.990> anyway<00:05:33.260> either<00:05:33.590> way

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
was easy enough to do anyway either way

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.850 
was easy enough to do anyway either way
so<00:05:35.030> that's<00:05:35.150> that<00:05:35.389> so<00:05:35.690> after<00:05:35.810> we<00:05:35.960> assemble<00:05:36.440> we

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
so that's that so after we assemble we

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.230 
so that's that so after we assemble we
just<00:05:37.010> need<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.220> put<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.430> back<00:05:37.520> in<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.820> washer

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
just need to put it back in the washer

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.029 
just need to put it back in the washer
bolts<00:05:38.840> it<00:05:38.930> back<00:05:39.080> in<00:05:39.260> connect<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.650> up<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:39.950> then

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
bolts it back in connect it up and then

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:44.860 
bolts it back in connect it up and then
give<00:05:40.160> it<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.280> test<00:05:42.970> one<00:05:43.970> thing<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.330> remember<00:05:44.479> is

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
give it a test one thing to remember is

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.180 
give it a test one thing to remember is
they're<00:05:45.080> all<00:05:45.169> most<00:05:45.380> likely<00:05:45.650> be<00:05:45.770> an<00:05:45.950> earth

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
they're all most likely be an earth

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.490 
they're all most likely be an earth

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
the body make sure you don't miss this

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.210 
the body make sure you don't miss this
out<00:05:52.220> when<00:05:52.370> you're<00:05:52.490> putting<00:05:52.700> it<00:05:52.760> back<00:05:52.849> in<00:05:54.220> now

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
out when you're putting it back in now

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.550 
out when you're putting it back in now
the<00:05:55.550> next<00:05:55.880> job<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.240> do<00:05:56.360> is<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.840> refit<00:05:57.199> the<00:05:57.289> belt

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
the next job to do is to refit the belt

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.129 
the next job to do is to refit the belt
what<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.220> find<00:05:58.550> is<00:05:58.760> we're<00:05:59.330> doing<00:05:59.510> this<00:05:59.750> is<00:06:00.080> to

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
what I find is we're doing this is to

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.990 
what I find is we're doing this is to
basically<00:06:00.680> put<00:06:01.099> the<00:06:01.280> belt<00:06:01.729> over<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.150> motor

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
basically put the belt over the motor

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.909 
basically put the belt over the motor
plate<00:06:05.000> nice<00:06:05.510> put<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.470> belt<00:06:06.620> over<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.830> motor

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
plate nice put the belt over the motor

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.450 
plate nice put the belt over the motor
and<00:06:07.520> then<00:06:07.699> basically<00:06:08.470> stop<00:06:09.470> put<00:06:09.710> half<00:06:10.010> on<00:06:10.280> the

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
and then basically stop put half on the

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.600 
and then basically stop put half on the
wheel<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.880> then<00:06:11.510> with<00:06:12.229> your<00:06:12.380> hand<00:06:12.650> rotates

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
wheel and then with your hand rotates

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.570 
wheel and then with your hand rotates
the<00:06:14.000> wheel<00:06:14.050> on<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.349> drum<00:06:15.590> while<00:06:15.919> film<00:06:16.280> between

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
the wheel on the drum while film between

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.240 
the wheel on the drum while film between
the<00:06:16.699> belt<00:06:16.880> over<00:06:17.180> in<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.389> mush<00:06:17.539> or<00:06:17.840> nicely<00:06:18.380> okay

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
the belt over in the mush or nicely okay

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.710 
the belt over in the mush or nicely okay
so<00:06:19.310> we're<00:06:19.639> all<00:06:19.669> connected<00:06:19.970> up<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.419> ready<00:06:20.539> for

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
so we're all connected up and ready for

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:31.279 
so we're all connected up and ready for
testing<00:06:22.210> switch<00:06:23.210> on<00:06:23.419> for<00:06:23.449> me

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.189 

go<00:06:32.289> excellent<00:06:32.949> it's<00:06:33.220> working<00:06:33.870> now<00:06:34.870> it's

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
go excellent it's working now it's

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.960 
go excellent it's working now it's
probably<00:06:35.440> going<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.620> sound<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:36.069> bit<00:06:36.099> grinding

probably going to sound a bit grinding
it<00:06:37.090> might<00:06:37.300> be<00:06:37.449> a<00:06:37.479> bit<00:06:37.630> spotty<00:06:38.080> for<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.590> first

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
it might be a bit spotty for the first

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.770 
it might be a bit spotty for the first
minute<00:06:39.099> or<00:06:39.370> two<00:06:39.580> but<00:06:40.060> as<00:06:40.270> the<00:06:40.389> brush<00:06:40.630> is

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
minute or two but as the brush is
