tablespoons<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.990> coconut<00:02:47.500> oil<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.190> I've

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
tablespoons of coconut oil now I've

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.300 
tablespoons of coconut oil now I've
melted<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.910> coconut<00:02:49.510> oil<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:50.020> below<00:02:50.680> 24

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
melted this coconut oil because below 24

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.820 
melted this coconut oil because below 24
degrees<00:02:51.700> Celsius<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.390> think<00:02:52.630> that's<00:02:52.780> about<00:02:52.930> 76

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
degrees Celsius I think that's about 76

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.370 
degrees Celsius I think that's about 76
degrees<00:02:54.160> Fahrenheit<00:02:55.260> coconut<00:02:56.260> oil

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
degrees Fahrenheit coconut oil

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.050 
degrees Fahrenheit coconut oil
solidifies<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:57.819> I<00:02:57.849> want<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.120> put<00:02:58.270> 3

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
solidifies so I want to put 3

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.760 
solidifies so I want to put 3
tablespoons

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
tablespoons

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.350 
tablespoons
and<00:03:03.610> then<00:03:04.540> we<00:03:05.080> need<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.350> add<00:03:05.500> 1tbsp<00:03:06.070> of<00:03:06.730> taking

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
and then we need to add 1tbsp of taking

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:18.120 
and then we need to add 1tbsp of taking
me<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:12.100> teaspoon<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:13.000> vanilla<00:03:13.390> essence<00:03:17.130> so
