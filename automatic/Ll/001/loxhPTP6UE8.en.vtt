00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 ok they are all big and far less than 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.830
 this brand new video this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.010
 review of the address book you are looking for 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.559
 broadcast the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.059
 phonebook called abax bank stack where vi 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.029
 I present little in the objects 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.660
 Electronic I use to make of the recent 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.910
 game use for the channel but also that I use 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619
 for my own sake 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 today we go to see the microphone that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 I will use the star of the trust 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.770
 stars behind are the specifications in each 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.590
 tongue I've already unpacked everything for 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.239
 check that it worked and in art 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 native change it 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.430
 here it says in Italian I don't know if 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 lightweight high performance microphone 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.070
 equipped with deactivation switch 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 based three-foot audio for a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.260
 natural reproduction 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.329
 high quality had to see us here 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.540
 what we find in the tripod package 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.530
 the microphone and the front jack we can 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.380
 see ok, high performance design three 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.979
 years of guarantee offered by trust therefore 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.170
 quite good if it breaks 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.750
 the various things 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.860
 2.5 meters can therefore be used 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.390
 even on one on a video camera to say 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.289
 so very long along the wire 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 jack jack of three and a half in their gold a 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.320
 serving must net is ok, gold iron 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.649
 that's no gold at a broadcast anymore 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.130
 clean and more immediately designed 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:45.500
 let's say in the end the microphone is 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.350
 trust me this is really small a 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.720
 see it that is rare to follow found 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.280
 I got it we also carry by price 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.130
 that reasonable for its quality 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 15 euros 15 euros and little but the quality 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.860
 entirely at 57 focuses on 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.369
 microphone is taken in hand is really 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.440
 little one really believe me 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.050
 hand is a little big mine is out of the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.470
 however, we say it's really small 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.830
 I don't know if those mic are you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:23.940
 accustomed as if really small then 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.940
 as we see above on key on and off 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.530
 all 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 you see on and off 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.860
 to deactivate it live we say no 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.580
 trust logo above especially in 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.870
 iron obviously therefore said base 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.780
 you can tripod events 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.430
 quietly peel off to make it e 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.739
 move the base to a tripod base to three 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.739
 many feet think slides and stuff 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.209
 various but not here to the rubbers those of 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.030
 comini that allow the surfer I sit 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.190
 on a smooth surface that this is 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.850
 on a rough surface that can be 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.760
 this which in the end these to the 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.459
 microphone now I make you feel 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.170
 a little proof of this trust start 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.680
 stop that until m claudio recorded 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.260
 of the video camera is ok boy then them 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.480
 this is the microphone in 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.709
 in use 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.620
 in actuality a bit of fruges has been heard of 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.800
 bottom don't worry it's due to 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.530
 fact that I am close to the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.010
 for computer then the fan turning 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.590
 from a little rustling but the task as 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.020
 the microphone absolutely no 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.150
 problem even tries to shut up e 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.150
 let's see if it was heard by some noise 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.860
 as you can see the rustling is due to 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.570
 computer if there is that little rustling but the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.180
 with bale 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.460
 the microphone is one of those microphones that 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.560
 is worth what things we say trusts do not 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.740
 promises us nothing so great as 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.480
 certainly not comparable to a blue yeti 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.160
 however for the price if one wants to spend 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.480
 little but still wants to have a good one 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.049
 quality 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.970
 and a great guy in my opinion for 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.560
 this video is everything we see each other a 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.050
 next video if the unboxing is there 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.210
 liked I recommend you put a mi 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.010
 like to subscribe to the channel because they don't 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.960
 also to comment if you want to give me 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.970
 any advice on this channel 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.919
 on this microphone wins can always with 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.900
 the words but we'll see each other next 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.900
