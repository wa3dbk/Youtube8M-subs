00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.430
 and today I am going to have them bring you a 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:09.010
 spartan helmet the movie 300 is 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.860
 elaborated in what is fiber glass 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.290
 and cardboard that is not any other 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.200
 material but fiberglass putty and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.189
 cardboard you see is a helmet that is very 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.170
 resistant bone that resists everything not 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.180
 it breaks for nothing you can do what 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.530
 that you want that is not going to break 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.350
 it can fall or whatever 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.180
 These parts are cardboard but they are 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.010
 glass fiber even finer because 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.250
 clear to put it in the case that you 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.530
 you want to put it this has to open 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.990
 the nose also lasts so that it does not 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.880
 nothing happens and for better reinforced you 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.480
 we have put an iron what is the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.370
 part of the interior does not bother to 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 nothing you can take away since no 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.499
 upset 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.120
 as I have done so I have taken and the 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:57.659
 cut what this part right here 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.550
 how they see the side and I've done it with 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.890
 cardboard is this ends here in the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.949
 tip and what I've done is take with 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.080
 another strip of cardboard and disunited I 've 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 stuck this part with tape to give 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 that they do not stick together and I've stuck 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.149
 the other with cardboard measuring my head 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.299
 and that I do not fall because if it's left 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.939
 great the truth that is a bitch 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.799
 so to speak that is dancing in the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.860
 head has to be more or less 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.429
 just then what joined after I took and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.740
 for to read what the dome 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:31.200
 I have taken and has begun to join with strips 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.650
 measuring me from my head first I've 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.770
 caught and made the strip that is worth 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.130
 not the one that unites them that is this that goes by 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.500
 here after I have done 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.450
 that the one is here after that 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.310
 is the one that join from the nose to the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.780
 part east from behind always looking at that 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.840
 it is more or less redondito and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.570
 that we stay a little loose and now 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.100
 when we go let's unite all this 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.630
 then I put one here and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.929
 these parents more shapes and then I have 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.610
 made by wrapping everything in ribbon tape 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.340
 glass seats that is like fiber 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.920
 glass that is very resistant and I have 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.410
 stuck everything in this tape because because 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.630
 after putting the fiber on it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.269
 although it does not seem so then putting it on 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.120
 fiber is something like that happens that goes to 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.489
 remain undulations and for that it is not 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.380
 just put a fiber layer and that's it 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.739
 you have to put him I put three and 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.480
 then a fiber that is like cotton 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.830
 we are putting it and that we are filling 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.360
 the gaps I have put here also 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.150
 you have put this is not finished 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.950
 obviously this you have to choose the mode you 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.730
 gone putting the figure here 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.610
 then sanding the sanding to make 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.650
 this part I forget 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.960
 this part of choosing and it will be for 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.360
 up here then what we have to 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.430
 to do is to take a strip of cardboard that 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.520
 go here and paste it for all this 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.190
 while go here 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.160
 for this part a piece of cardboard in the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.510
 circle and we measure it and we are putting it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.830
 here is half spoken because this is not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.560
 is still made of fiber 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.220
 glass if I did it fast but 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.770
 then it is not over 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.300
 then it is staying what we are doing 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.110
 these ways have the producer of 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.720
 neck afterwards and this is very simple what 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.960
 to leave is never like and simple and 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.790
 then there is the strip of this one that goes here 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.190
 so then it ends with the peak that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.890
 we can see it in the movie you can 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.110
 do if very difficult because we have to 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.520
 do it in cardboard put the fiber and that 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.160
 it was just round and I had another 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.350
 Equal helmet and I did not make it 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.980
 in this helmet is what is very good 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.050
 for 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.540
 to work a glass fiber is very 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.730
 easy to work on it's a helmet that 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.680
 It is well made 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.560
 they have their geometries exactly 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.720
 the same to make the cuts as they see is 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.510
 this one the one in the movie I've taken and 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.810
 I have cut 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.129
 I cut it with scissors this here 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.610
 is not here I have tube that according to the 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.830
 small saw 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.200
 it has no ridges because it has no ridge 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.510
 because because I have a crest 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.370
 he could have easily put it on 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.830
 which is the crest box 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.900
 I do not find any ridge that is left 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.669
 well to the helmet that is to say they do not sell crests 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.310
 that you say some is made of hair 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.750
 that's how big they do not sell them then 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.030
 I have decided to do it without a crest so as not to 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.639
 leave them unfinished you can put 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.590
 later on, if we choose this, we will 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.970
 what is the crest box and you 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.919
 we put the hair I do not know that you what 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.930
 I would go from here down to 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.060
 up here the helmet is very beautiful 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.240
 with the crest I tell you I did it a 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.919
 box previously to another and would have 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.090
 it looked good but I did not find any 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.699
 material to do it like this one 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.830
 and well this is all this is the helmet 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.169
 pounds later on go doing the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.270
 fiberglass shield and how to make 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.010
 the mold and everything and I 'll explain it 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.320
 later on so lucky if you're going to 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.250
 do and nothing and this is the helmet 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.250
 Spartan
