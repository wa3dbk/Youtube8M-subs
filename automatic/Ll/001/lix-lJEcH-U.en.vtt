00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:10.000
 I went to Izu touring at the end of September 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.460
 Of course beneath models have been carried out in the bike cbr is 250 r Needless to say 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.630
 This is kind of car 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.050
 This time, after a mount in the mobile touring specification now or go create an environment that can be charged 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.620
 The 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:32.119
 The've been saying is I'd Izu than at this time was still quite warm 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:35.570
 Please take a look as the photos are good touring 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.890
 It is route, but leaves Shizuoka 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:45.220
 I 'm going to go there without going 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.790
 It was scorched with Minamiko Line, but from Izu Kita side 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.180
 We went to the route that we went south on the west route 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.760
 In the middle of this 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.239
 It is a place break field, such like there was by the sea 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.620
 The scenery was beautiful and there were many seas 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.790
 It looks Fuji Mt. 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.790
 I'm glad this route 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.600
 This day was a weekday in September but 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.350
 There is only Izu and it is popular with people touring after all 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.110
 And two other riders passed each other 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.130
 Harley Toka quite have personally bike it it was amazing is I prefer sports bike 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.810
 But what is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.000
 Toka Uncle Harley running in a group 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:32.770
 I think it's a bit jealous when I see it looks like something is fun 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.520
 I often go touring at 250 c for those who are large riding 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.909
 I'm asked if it's tight, but in the case of me, this cbr's surprisingly run normally 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.969
 I'm not bothered 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 You can go to 250 cc but also touring 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:56.609
 Among the members who went touring together just this time , a 700 cc bike ride 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.230
 There was a person there, but if that person shook the leaf gear of that cocoon, I would care about it 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.159
 I do not 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.909
 It is impossible even if it thinks somehow 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.119
 It is what I'm was just touring man 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.000
 I wonder if there is a west of water running 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.819
 Here 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.610
 This is a lover 岬 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.090
 When I went here 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 I may ring the bell 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:24.480
 Any destination like a be happy copulation and play with him I wonder I wonder should I say Nante two people 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.569
 It's cheap Holy Land lover I 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 I went members riding to go to what the guys sacred place of such lover is all man this time 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.960
 I'd eyes met went on to Seth little Kaneda et al care 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:46.450
 In the gold or A 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:51.160
 Which one also there or around, but three of the way that you go and from the parking lot to the Lovers Point of is our hospital forecast 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.680
 Such Ya because all of man I feel is to copulation hand, as has been said end also there to eat mountain to 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.710
 I like do not want to Ma was brother Toka experience 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.670
 Betsy's money is there 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.200
 Move to the next 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.550
 There is a reaction of the person who sees this also with this guy alone 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.100
 Seems to feel 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:13.010
 I do not know 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:18.770
 Well, depending on the mench, the eyes of the passers are very painful, but as the view seen from ourselves 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:24.800
 Z 1 there is snow alive even one person so great clean is a good location is better absolutely went 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:27.900
 My heart will be strong Oh, I can see Mt. Fuji because it was on the floor of this gold 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.700
 It is a key that only you can think of 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.350
 The guy who is falling to the lower right of the day is a day protector during touring 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.840
 I want to get together if things happen 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.989
 Another picture of a bike is this tool 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.940
 This is it handle Marley has become something like 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.940
 It is surprisingly easy to use this mound 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:57.880
 How 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.350
 Now after leaving Lover , I went down by the sea ​​and I went down by the sea 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.200
 It is south to say 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:09.640
 Because severe in its own way, even September as I said I'd had this when September 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.450
 Because it was fest there was n't a time in front of Omaezaki, but if it's south, it's probably expensive 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.900
 Say 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:21.579
 I just went south with the idea of ​​plate cells 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:24.330
 It is this Shiozaki lighthouse which is the point which went south in so, but this is not the southernmost tip of Shizuoka prefecture 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.460
 It is the southernmost tip of the Iza Peninsula 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.460
 There is a shrine here 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.940
 This is this person 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:41.150
 And or can what if put here offertory 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:42.350
 If you want to go further ahead, you can take it, so to speak, but before that there is this 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:48.440
 I will 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:51.590
 Old people in quite a sacred place I'd be seen if you go is why is each revere this place 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.820
 I will feel to know a little that the kana Tteyuu 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:01.569
 Maybe if you go to see the first sunrise or see it looks amazing 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:06.729
 It looks like oil, but I would like to see it here in Hiro 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:13.439
 For example, I walked for a while from the road parking lot on the way to here 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.439
 It's there is to like a amusement park that was ruined in the middle 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.930
 Also Toka love ruins It's grunt good 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.280
 It does MAY recommended 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:41.460
 In this way, I saw it ahead on the way back to parking 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:47.060
 It is the beginning of autumn leaves 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:51.530
 It is cheap also can be turn in the play and bought a cruise pier 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:57.380
 It was already quite late when we went ahead of the water, so from there 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.550
 At once to the top of Hakone in Jesus that is between the rain through the Toka scan puppet Izu Skyline 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:05.389
 I got in 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:07.050
 Came home in using the bypass from the top of the Hakone to where Route 1 and hind national highway 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:12.449
 Just in 11 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:15.889
 This distance is Attama was tired anyway roughly 350 or more 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.889
 Is more than tooling report
