00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.230
 give dance classes and yeah 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.859
 we had no more time what 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 5.6 x what are you stars you have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 danced with big stars then is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 what there is a new big star 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 stars that you have a contract some 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.399
 thing that's all we do is 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.090
 always in the discretion we like 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.250
 shock the world 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.489
 the more it looks like a shock you're the ones 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.590
 win jose beautiful yes you want 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.059
 still participate this year I think 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.559
 not actually we are we have a lot of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 things to do including those projects that we do not 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.230
 can not talk about it now that they are 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 will do and start in the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.510
 next weekends we'll say that like 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.399
 and I would like to do it but hey 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.109
 think we are a little bit for what 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.820
 to occupy and then we've already done our 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.289
 evidence i think yeah we already have our 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.809
 funds already nadja proven ourselves but 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 it's just that the standing game 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.950
 I think there is a lot of good 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.510
 dancers that's true but I do not think so 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.430
 we should do but if we do 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.110
 well this rules for the leisure that is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.820
 that you wish for dancers to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 kenya we all have work to do yeah 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.390
 frankly they have a great talent in 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.159
 the eure in their category so after 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.400
 there are some of them 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.409
 who bluffed me and but not after 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.299
 stop then I'm super 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.829
 Frankly I'm expecting it 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.079
 a very big surprise all I 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.270
 did not expect that good I think I 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.619
 have to forgive me tomorrow because 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 I was also a dancer I was also at 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.369
 their place on my behalf I must congratulate 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.890
 also the choreographers who did that 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.689
 because the coaches it's just every 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.640
 week they have a theme they have a thing 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.119
 to do with a new sound game I'm 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.950
 put in their place 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 and I'm happy with my dad my 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.530
 brother and sister my coach was coming 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.759
 dancers if we actually do the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.580
 ask actually we are everyone 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.420
 except that we can feel at home 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.420
 Yes
