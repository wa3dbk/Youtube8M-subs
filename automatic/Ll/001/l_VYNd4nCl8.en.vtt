this<00:01:03.960> system<00:01:04.530> would<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.680> great<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.550> an

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this system would be great for an

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
this system would be great for an
individual<00:01:06.210> person<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.780> solo<00:01:07.050> hiker<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.440> maybe

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
individual person a solo hiker or maybe

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.139 
individual person a solo hiker or maybe
a<00:01:07.740> couple<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.910> two<00:01:09.119> or

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
a couple going out for a two or

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.639 
a couple going out for a two or
three-day<00:01:09.420> trip<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.259> if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.440> wanted

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
three-day trip but if you wanted

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.340 
three-day trip but if you wanted
something<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> little<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.520> than<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
something a little bit more than that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.230 
something a little bit more than that
then<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.619> move<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.979> 13.5<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.550> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
then you can move up to the 13.5 and the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.270 
then you can move up to the 13.5 and the
Sherpa<00:01:18.570> 50<00:01:18.990> which<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.530> allow<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Sherpa 50 which will allow you to have

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.670 
Sherpa 50 which will allow you to have
double<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.270> amount<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.780> solar<00:01:21.990> energy<00:01:22.440> coming

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
double the amount of solar energy coming

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
double the amount of solar energy coming
through<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.039> system<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.580> put<00:01:24.149> it<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
through the system and put it into a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.529 
through the system and put it into a
much<00:01:25.320> bigger<00:01:25.670> vestibule<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.910> order<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.300> be

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
much bigger vestibule in order to be

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.330 
much bigger vestibule in order to be
able<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> extract<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.590> store<00:01:28.800> your<00:01:28.830> energy

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
able to extract and store your energy

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
able to extract and store your energy
for<00:01:29.820> example<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.330> use<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.690> particular
