50<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.700> goes<00:01:14.939> better<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.780> 2-d<00:01:16.229> game

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
50 really goes better as a 2-d game

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.570 
50 really goes better as a 2-d game

dimensional<00:02:16.299> on<00:02:17.069> characters<00:02:18.540> let's<00:02:19.540> talk

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
dimensional on characters let's talk

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.380 
dimensional on characters let's talk
about<00:02:19.900> creative<00:02:20.439> modes<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.189> can<00:02:21.359> create<00:02:22.359> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
about creative modes you can create a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.990 
about creative modes you can create a
ring<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.560> which<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.859> find<00:02:24.040> really<00:02:24.430> really

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
ring in this which I find really really

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.199 
ring in this which I find really really
fun<00:02:25.500> because<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.859> just<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.219> interesting<00:02:27.730> and

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
fun because it's just so interesting and

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.959 
fun because it's just so interesting and
what<00:02:28.870> makes<00:02:29.049> me<00:02:29.230> even<00:02:29.409> more<00:02:29.590> intrigued<00:02:30.400> by<00:02:30.700> his

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:30.969 
what makes me even more intrigued by his

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.929 
what makes me even more intrigued by his
game<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:32.109> fact<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.739> allows<00:02:33.189> you<00:02:33.609> to

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
game the fact that it allows you to

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.420 
game the fact that it allows you to
create<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.810> belt<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.500> free<00:02:35.829> which<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.159> can't

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
of the SVR games is 08 not just because

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.479 
of the SVR games is 08 not just because
it<00:02:43.959> just<00:02:44.139> came<00:02:44.379> out<00:02:44.439> but<00:02:44.859> because<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.579> can<00:02:46.000> oh

like awake because as Extreme Rules
which<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.299> kind<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.659> like<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.840> death<00:02:53.169> match<00:02:53.470> but

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299

which is kind of like a death match but
and<00:02:55.439> you<00:02:56.439> can<00:02:56.849> create<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:57.969> belt<00:02:58.480> but<00:02:59.169> I<00:02:59.409> hate<00:02:59.769> how

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
and you can create a belt but I hate how

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.159 
and you can create a belt but I hate how
you<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.219> to<00:03:00.430> spend<00:03:00.700> money<00:03:01.079> bought<00:03:02.079> on<00:03:02.290> uh-uh
