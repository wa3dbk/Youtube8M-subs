 too many toys to touch the girl 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:18.810

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.859
 so many hello kitty things 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.420
 Spongebob and Patrick have a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.420
 a little homosexual relationship 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.550
 Let's leave the barbarities with the drawings 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.190
 certain that the little ones please 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.649
 then appear certain dolls that are born 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.370
 my sister buy him exposed skipped by 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.269
 Christmas by kings everything and those are 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.269
 sights 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.990
 when I was little the good things 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.670
 let's not say that you feel older because 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.060
 I am 20 years old when I for example was 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.060
 small 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 yes 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.909
 is that when they gave me before I 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.970
 gave away a ball was to play with my 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.799
 friends to a park or whatever and a 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.960
 my friend had a very strong ball 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.259
 then some kids caught the ball 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.259
 they say 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.450
 the ball 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.960
 so much 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:15.510
 because he's a guy who happens to be 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:18.210
 suddenly the best of the world appeared 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.830
 it was a subject in its time because if then 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.630
 when we went to the disco and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.750
 find for example that they abide by this 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:29.840
 save the disc to dance with my diva 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.840
 virtual since how to wiggle 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.720
 I'm going to load my sister's bed 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.240
 because they have decreed old ones that I dwelt 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.250
 and that I flew to see I only have a few 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.110
 how many but it is not the same what 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.470
 same I just reggaeton from before and that 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.960
 I enjoyed if I went from fucking mother to myself 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.150
 you have to see this you have to see this 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.340
 the walkie talkies of the of the mounts 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.019
 drive 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.080
 they are possessed to the touch more respect 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.510
 came out pretty doctor 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.230
 and look at this life when I was little 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.230
 what happens is that um 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.750
 yes these are the fierce criticism and here 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.640
 they have the hello kitty obese they take 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.690
 well but when they fight it is felt 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.690
 on the plasta 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.340
 the old reggaeton lyrics and that 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.290
 they emulated for example and yes they behave 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.600
 wrong so far from the sting and yes that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.550
 misbehaves also with the whip and great song 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.200
 for a rural party but what I'm going to 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.560
 say to sound very nice of the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.560
 poems 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.410
 of sex 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.469

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.150

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.280
 It was better than modern kids 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.319
 from before they were more children than now 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.150
 that the children of before did more things 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.799
 of children that the now that is that the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.810

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.190

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.120
