something<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:00.630> watch<00:02:00.810> does<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
something like that my watch does a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.700 
something like that my watch does a
little<00:02:01.200> bit<00:02:01.290> over<00:02:01.469> 35<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.909> i'm<00:02:02.969> currently

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
little bit over 35 but i'm currently

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
little bit over 35 but i'm currently
according<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> race<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:06.149> say<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
according to the race they say I'm a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.559 
according to the race they say I'm a
little<00:02:06.630> bit<00:02:06.719> over<00:02:06.899> 34<00:02:07.320> miles<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.569> can

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
little bit over 34 miles and so I can

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.210 
little bit over 34 miles and so I can
pretty<00:02:09.720> much<00:02:09.840> walk<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> wrestle<00:02:11.069> AI

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
pretty much walk this in the wrestle AI

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.350 
pretty much walk this in the wrestle AI
got<00:02:11.459> plenty<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> time

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
got plenty of time

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.780 
got plenty of time
so<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.530> what<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.890> towpath<00:02:16.310> looks<00:02:16.580> like

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
so this is what the towpath looks like

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.390 
so this is what the towpath looks like
it<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.690> stagnant<00:02:18.620> boring<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.989> extremely<00:02:20.989> uh<00:02:21.440> I

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
it is stagnant boring and extremely uh I

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.890 
it is stagnant boring and extremely uh I
can't<00:02:22.819> think<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.030> another<00:02:23.209> word<00:02:23.450> besides<00:02:23.480> of

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
can't think of another word besides of

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.010 
can't think of another word besides of
boring<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:24.410> very<00:02:25.220> monotonous<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:26.870> this

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
boring but very monotonous and it's this

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.729 
boring but very monotonous and it's this

close to being off of this I got three

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.770 
close to being off of this I got three
hours<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.280> 45<00:03:55.670> minutes<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:56.180> finish<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.660> which
