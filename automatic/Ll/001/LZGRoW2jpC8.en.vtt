to the corner flag in the 94th minute

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
to the corner flag in the 94th minute
you'd<00:01:02.640> see<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.030> boy<00:01:03.149> standing<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.629> the

team hip is a ball in the box so that's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.420 
team hip is a ball in the box so that's
all<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.409> development<00:01:07.890> part<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
all the development part from them so

all the development part from them so
who<00:01:08.490> knows<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> next<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.150> listen<00:01:09.659> that's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
who knows it next time listen that's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.000 
who knows it next time listen that's
part<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> game<00:01:10.409> though<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
part of the game though you have to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
part of the game though you have to
waste<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.909> certainly<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> game

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
waste time it certainly is in the game

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.210 
waste time it certainly is in the game
and<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.260> partly<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> development<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and that's partly the development and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.890 
and that's partly the development and
understanding<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> takes<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> game

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
understanding what it takes in the game

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.359
