00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.499
 on computer need 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:05.499
 work honestly does not arise very often 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.109
 today will tell 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.599
 how can 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.849
 to operate 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.109
 different numbers 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.689
 drove on components is on masonry 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:18.980
 logics 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.119
 and the first one 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.929
 this component 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.819
 which perform the simplest 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.819
 arithmetically operation 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.950
 he can only work with two 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.050
 glasses 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900
 here we have the first tranche 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.000
 data point for him 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.100
 and second 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.680
 for them there are appropriate 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 options but my 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.570
 will do 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.570
 but pass the information through 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 we put the button 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 0 smaller 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.390
 write any sign 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 arithmetic operation is admissible 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.870
 after that you can put an inscription 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.570
 because writing 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.660
 equally 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.760
 it was all over 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.000
 one more field 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 for 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
 result 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.660
 but you can set the parameters at the Duma 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.160
 it means read only 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.630
 three so that the result can be 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.940
 change only there is a program 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 explained that it was impossible 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 the operation is set parameters in the second 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.700
 here you can choose 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.179
 many different operations 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.250
 but for example 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.250
 Of course this prestige with plus 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.599
 stream here on market events for sale 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.749
 result 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 the result can also be considered a line 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:25.769
 streams 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.039
 transferred information 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.639
 entry field 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.509
 and set using the button in 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.909
 target 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.939
 now you can run the program and 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.009
 to try 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 tell me what 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.249
 numbers but here we are 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.249
 it turns out 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.490
 the program gives 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.490
 result 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.349
 in the same way we can say 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.029
 on the buttons inscription 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.369
 it is desirable to change 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.459
 but of course from start for example there is 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.789
 result but 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.199
 for better perception of canada 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.169
 to change 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.389
 So you see that you can work with 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.389
 negative numbers 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.269
 moreover you can work 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.269
 cooperation let's say 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.239
 40 of them 1 1 4 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.539
 the result we have 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.539
 integer but if we divide by 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.469
 we get 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.169
 how many characters is the usb port and therefore need 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.399
 to expand 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:52.549
 according to the results 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.349
 40 to be 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.449
 into a tree 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.169
 we get from 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.169
 that's just to buy 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.479
 after comma 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.289
 more precisely after the point 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:05.939
 so if you want to give if 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:06.599
 number 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.059
 with the sign 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.059
 instead they need to use 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.459
 if 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.739
 division is necessary 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.779
 sounds weird 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.050
 then you can here 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.050
 select result 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.400
 and then 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 nothing will be the county 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.969
 operation of which the price of technology Anita 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.159
 she is also a seller 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.159
 integer 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.889
 any type operations 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.349
 Robinho 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.349
 Greek successor 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.430
 but without them others 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.430
 root square on absolutely values 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.129
 You can also select the minimum 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.870
 number and and maximum 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.919
 there is a god 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.810
 sentence here for example choose 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.710
 as much as possible 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.740
 that there are such agencies 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.889
 we do it 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.349
 dance 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.349
 but companies are pretty simple 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.440
 if you need to count for some 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.580
 difficult full pillar 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 is necessary 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.009
 then you need to use 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.759
 other components are also on the tab 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.759
 logics 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.830
 this component to them 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.589
 mathematically pathos 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:47.960
 may have already 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.479
 few top points are they 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.870
 dynamic allowable pick up 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.870
 for up to one hundred 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.430
 form is written in this meeting 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.379
 how to use 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.319
 Well, let's assume for themselves two of them 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.729
 and our last guys a year 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.099
 they then result accordingly 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.059
 there is also a result 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.549
 the default is there the default result which 

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:19.080
 contained on the point 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.080
 and now we will set the construction site 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.539
 Well, firstly to put 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.539
 ii to use any 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.180
 operator 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.379
 need to put a percentage and 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.550
 point number which we consider 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.259
 where dots from May 14 begin with 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.110
 units 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.159
 because 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:41.950
 fraction can means 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.950
 result previous cooperation 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.629
 but will they let the pirates go? 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.249
 interest on them 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.249
 that is, the first terrorist attack plus a percentage 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:06:59.469
 divide by 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.460
 unless of course you need 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.460
 such an operation 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.949
 launched by Stalin 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.219
 clean let's say 5 and 4 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:17.219
 no secret that there will be no less 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:20.960
 dynamics best conditions 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.630
 all right 5 4 divided into will not 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.830
 9 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.719
 we can write with the most different 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:28.990
 purely 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.289
 and get the result 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.999
 but if you write wrong somewhere 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:36.429
 it is acceptable that people put everything to themselves 

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:37.719
 this amount 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:40.339
 such know that when washing 

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:41.969
 by words will arise 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:44.969
 error therefore 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:47.539
 before the release of the suicide program 

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:49.110
 check 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.030
 program availability good
