than ice box right now it'll be on ps3
and<00:00:26.250> think<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.580> few<00:00:26.789> weeks<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> month<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
and think a few weeks or a month and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
because this is my opinion the hardest

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520 
because this is my opinion the hardest

after<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.110> partner<00:01:04.470> or<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.489> you're<00:01:06.150> playing

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
after your partner or if you're playing

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
after your partner or if you're playing
by<00:01:06.479> yourself<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:07.020> partner's<00:01:07.619> far<00:01:07.860> away

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
by yourself if your partner's far away

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490 
by yourself if your partner's far away
from<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.670> zombies<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.360> by<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
from you the zombies will go by this I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.310 
from you the zombies will go by this I
guess<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.250> half<00:01:11.760> wall<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.080> right

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
guess this half wall that's to my right

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.990 
guess this half wall that's to my right
but<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.280> glitch<00:01:14.520> isn't<00:01:14.850> perfect<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:16.020> if

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
but this glitch isn't perfect because if

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
but this glitch isn't perfect because if
this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.150> there's<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> window<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> left<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
this is there's a window to the left of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
this is there's a window to the left of
you<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.400> thinking<00:01:20.729> yet<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> left<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you I'm just thinking yet to the left of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.929 
you I'm just thinking yet to the left of
you<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.890> sometimes<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.280> zombie<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:23.759> come

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
you and sometimes a zombie will come

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609 
you and sometimes a zombie will come
through<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.270> window<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> he<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.200> push<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
through that window and he will push you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070 
through that window and he will push you
out<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.189> glitch<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.869> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
out of this glitch and then you can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.569 
out of this glitch and then you can
you'll<00:01:28.259> pretty<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.860> rigged<00:01:29.159> because

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you'll pretty much get rigged because

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.890 
you'll pretty much get rigged because
you<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.909> no<00:01:30.030> juggernaut<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.750> nothing

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you have no juggernaut you have nothing

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.160 
you have no juggernaut you have nothing
cuz<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.530> map<00:01:31.710> has<00:01:31.860> no<00:01:32.009> perks<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> like

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
cuz this map has no perks so what I like

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
cuz this map has no perks so what I like
to<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.740> glitch<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.820> kind<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to have for this glitch it's kind of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.330 
to have for this glitch it's kind of
hard<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.170> i<00:01:37.710> somehow<00:01:38.070> about

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
hard to get I know I i somehow about

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.770 
hard to get I know I i somehow about

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
kind of a two hits is pretty easy for

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.490 
kind of a two hits is pretty easy for

one zombie when you're not looking and
thing<00:02:35.500> like<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:35.950> glitch<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.160> if<00:02:36.610> you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
thing like what this glitch is if you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.980 
thing like what this glitch is if you
have<00:02:36.790> your<00:02:36.910> body<00:02:37.150> covering<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:37.780> really

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
have your body covering you it's really

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.660 
have your body covering you it's really
easy<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> get<00:02:38.530> back<00:02:38.710> in<00:02:38.860> or<00:02:38.950> just<00:02:39.190> crouch<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
easy to get back in or just crouch and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.010 
easy to get back in or just crouch and
then<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:40.000> your<00:02:40.060> buddy<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.480> leave<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.840> and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
then you get your buddy to leave you and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.750 
then you get your buddy to leave you and
then<00:02:41.620> you're<00:02:41.830> good<00:02:42.210> so<00:02:43.210> as<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:44.400> dimension<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
then you're good so as a dimension the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.300 
then you're good so as a dimension the
best<00:02:45.970> way<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:46.660> this<00:02:46.930> glitch<00:02:47.170> works<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.650> if

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
best way I think this glitch works is if

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.740 
best way I think this glitch works is if
you<00:02:48.430> have<00:02:48.460> your<00:02:48.610> body<00:02:48.850> running<00:02:49.150> around<00:02:49.510> in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
you have your body running around in

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.090 
you have your body running around in
front<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.290> instead<00:02:50.470> of<00:02:50.650> hiding<00:02:50.860> back

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
front of you instead of hiding back

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.250 
front of you instead of hiding back
there<00:02:51.160> by<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:51.520> trench<00:02:51.820> gun<00:02:51.970> because<00:02:52.630> if<00:02:52.990> he's
