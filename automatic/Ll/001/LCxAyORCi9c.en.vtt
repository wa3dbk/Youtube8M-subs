00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
who's trying to like upgrade their HIDs

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.930 
who's trying to like upgrade their HIDs
to<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.750> they're<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.320> stopped<00:00:46.649> HIDs<00:00:47.340> know

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
to know they're they stopped HIDs know

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810 
to know they're they stopped HIDs know
that<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.750> hid<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.160> melt<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that the hid will actually melt in this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.990 
that the hid will actually melt in this
plastic<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:52.230> one<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.800> hoping<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
plastic this one I'm hoping that it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.880 
plastic this one I'm hoping that it
doesn't<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> way<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.350> eyes

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
doesn't do it because the way I eyes

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
doesn't do it because the way I eyes
I've<00:00:56.280> positioned<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> HID<00:00:58.980> bulb<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.850> will

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
I've positioned the the HID bulb it will

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.959 
I've positioned the the HID bulb it will
give<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> more<00:01:01.079> space<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.949> breathe<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> hope

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
give it more space to breathe so I hope

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
give it more space to breathe so I hope
that<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> air<00:01:03.449> doesn't<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.870> trapped<00:01:04.229> in

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that the air doesn't get trapped in

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
that the air doesn't get trapped in
Saturday<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> melt<00:01:05.850> through<00:01:06.090> glass<00:01:06.360> because

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
Saturday and melt through glass because

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.719 
Saturday and melt through glass because
that's<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.020> I've<00:01:07.080> been<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> last<00:01:07.470> time

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.960 

I<00:01:10.760> redid<00:01:11.570> my<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:12.020> hate<00:01:12.409> my<00:01:12.590> CCFL<00:01:13.490> rings<00:01:13.729> because

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
I redid my I hate my CCFL rings because

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.230 
I redid my I hate my CCFL rings because
it<00:01:14.930> was<00:01:15.080> melting<00:01:15.440> out<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:16.610> opened<00:01:17.210> it

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
it was melting out and I just opened it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.160 
it was melting out and I just opened it
up<00:01:17.360> put<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.590> new<00:01:18.920> set<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.990> yeah<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.960> next

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
up put in a new set and yeah the next

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.770 
up put in a new set and yeah the next
thing<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.409> did<00:01:24.470> was<00:01:25.780> shorten<00:01:26.780> my<00:01:27.280> intake<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.780> had

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
thing I did was shorten my intake I had

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.440 
thing I did was shorten my intake I had
the<00:01:29.960> cold<00:01:30.200> air<00:01:30.350> intake<00:01:30.940> but<00:01:31.940> because<00:01:32.270> it's

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
the cold air intake but because it's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.180 
the cold air intake but because it's
wintertime<00:01:32.750> I<00:01:33.290> don't<00:01:33.650> want<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.860> risk<00:01:34.009> getting

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
wintertime I don't want to risk getting

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.749 
wintertime I don't want to risk getting
any<00:01:35.229> any<00:01:36.229> snow<00:01:36.710> off<00:01:36.860> inside<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.310> there<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:37.550> I

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
any any snow off inside of there so I

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.530 
any any snow off inside of there so I
shortened<00:01:38.240> it

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
shortened it

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.460 
shortened it
the<00:01:38.960> HPS<00:01:39.680> comes<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.580> two<00:01:40.790> parts<00:01:41.000> one<00:01:41.990> part<00:01:42.020> go

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
the HPS comes in two parts one part go

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.980 
the HPS comes in two parts one part go
like<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.890> short<00:01:43.340> part<00:01:43.820> goes<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.660> bottom

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
like the short part goes to the bottom

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.070 
like the short part goes to the bottom
and<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:46.490> long<00:01:46.880> part<00:01:47.210> goes<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.600> bottom<00:01:47.899> and

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
and the long part goes to the bottom and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.249 
and the long part goes to the bottom and
you<00:01:48.200> could<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:48.619> slap<00:01:49.190> on<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.960> intake<00:01:50.960> here

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
you could just slap on the intake here

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.359 
you could just slap on the intake here
so<00:01:51.590> again<00:01:53.140> HPS<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.530> reason<00:01:54.770> why<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:54.950> bought<00:01:55.220> it

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
so again HPS the reason why I bought it

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.950 
so again HPS the reason why I bought it
is<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:55.820> reason<00:01:56.210> because<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.570> comes<00:01:56.810> in

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
is to this reason because it comes in

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.499 
is to this reason because it comes in
two<00:01:57.110> parts<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:58.009> uh<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.880> wrinkle<00:01:59.330> black

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
two parts and it uh it's wrinkle black

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.450 
two parts and it uh it's wrinkle black
always<00:01:59.840> one<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.259> comes<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:00.679> your<00:02:00.830> black<00:02:01.190> and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
always one that comes in your black and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.080 
always one that comes in your black and
it<00:02:01.910> has<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.360> mass<00:02:03.080> airflow<00:02:03.410> port<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.759> bought

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
it has the mass airflow port so I bought

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.539 
it has the mass airflow port so I bought
it<00:02:05.210> for<00:02:05.390> those<00:02:05.509> three<00:02:05.869> specific<00:02:06.350> reasons

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
it for those three specific reasons

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.900 
it for those three specific reasons
the<00:02:07.909> new<00:02:08.119> engine<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.509> Ultima<00:02:08.929> engine<00:02:09.910> she

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
the new engine the Ultima engine she

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.220 
the new engine the Ultima engine she
runs<00:02:11.120> quiet<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:13.450> she<00:02:14.450> seems<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.930> working

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
runs quiet and she seems to be working

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.190 
runs quiet and she seems to be working
pretty<00:02:15.410> good<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:15.830> far

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200

this<00:02:22.819> down<00:02:24.850> swapped<00:02:25.850> out<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> rims<00:02:26.270> these<00:02:26.690> are

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
this down swapped out the rims these are

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.150 
this down swapped out the rims these are
actually<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> race<00:02:27.440> rooms<00:02:27.680> they're<00:02:27.860> pretty

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
actually the race rooms they're pretty
