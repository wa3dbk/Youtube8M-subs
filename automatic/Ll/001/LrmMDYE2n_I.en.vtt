through its paces let me tell you what I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:23.960 
through its paces let me tell you what I

and<00:00:24.480> give<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> disclaimer<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.289> used<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.740> as

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and give you a disclaimer I used it as

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
and give you a disclaimer I used it as
my<00:00:26.070> only<00:00:26.310> watch<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.970> seven<00:00:27.180> days<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.449> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
my only watch for seven days which is

my only watch for seven days which is
the<00:00:27.599> first<00:00:27.869> time<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.650> ever<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.580> say

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the first time I really ever get to say

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.519 
the first time I really ever get to say
that<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> hardest

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that so this is one of the hardest

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
that so this is one of the hardest
devices<00:00:32.070> I've<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.489> ever<00:00:32.520> had<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> review<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.170 
devices I've really ever had to review I
try<00:00:34.260> really<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:35.010> hard<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.489> keep<00:00:35.579> all<00:00:35.820> bias

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
more I wore it the more I started to see

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
more I wore it the more I started to see
its<00:00:55.079> utility<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.489> surprising

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
its utility which is really surprising

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
its utility which is really surprising
it's<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.449> my<00:00:57.570> mind<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> harder<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
it's for my mind it's kind of harder to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's for my mind it's kind of harder to
change<00:00:58.710> someone's<00:00:59.129> mind<00:00:59.309> than<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
change someone's mind than it is to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.389 
change someone's mind than it is to
reinforce<00:01:00.570> already<00:01:01.530> preconceived<00:01:02.010> idea

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
reinforce already preconceived idea

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
reinforce already preconceived idea
about<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> product<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.690> still<00:01:03.870> far<00:01:04.199> from

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
about a product so it's still far from

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
about a product so it's still far from
perfect<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.100> let's<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.339> ahead<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.549> get

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
perfect so let's go ahead and get
