00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.830 
inches all the way to 15 inches and how
I<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:49.460> just<00:00:50.460> turn<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.600> guy

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
I do that is just turn this little guy

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.660 
I do that is just turn this little guy
and<00:00:52.789> I'll<00:00:53.789> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> try<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> show<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.440> uh

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
and I'll kind of try to show you but uh

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.660 
and I'll kind of try to show you but uh
so<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.059> gonna<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.360> smaller<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.670> normally

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
so it's gonna get smaller and normally

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
so it's gonna get smaller and normally
it<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.850> look<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.170> goes

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it would look like that but this goes

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.810 
it would look like that but this goes
like<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.309> end<00:01:05.640> up

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
like that so you can you can end up

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
like that so you can you can end up
creating<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.930> very<00:01:07.290> small<00:01:07.619> snare<00:01:07.920> stand<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
creating a very small snare stand and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.090 
creating a very small snare stand and
then<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.409> tighten<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.920> thingy

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
then you just tighten that little thingy

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.450 
then you just tighten that little thingy
and<00:01:12.060> it'll<00:01:12.270> stay<00:01:12.450> right<00:01:12.600> there

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
and it'll stay right there

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.590 
and it'll stay right there
and<00:01:14.460> you'll<00:01:14.670> tighten<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.270> guy<00:01:15.360> too

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and you'll tighten that little guy too

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840
