00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to do an intent to trademark and then

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.319

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
most of times that's going to cost more

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
most of times that's going to cost more
than<00:01:58.950> putting<00:01:59.520> product<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> market

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
want proof that it's not someone sort of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.630 
want proof that it's not someone sort of
related<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.900> if<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.680> do<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.130> commerce

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
related to you if you do it in commerce

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.600 
related to you if you do it in commerce
then<00:02:23.230> then<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.410> can<00:02:24.440> prove<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.220> there's<00:02:25.550> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
then then you can prove that there's a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.130 
then then you can prove that there's a
transaction<00:02:26.180> where<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.480> sold<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.960> goods

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
transaction where you sold the goods

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.920 
transaction where you sold the goods
under<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.620> name<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.250> logo<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:29.540> likeness

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
under that name that logo that likeness

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.200 
under that name that logo that likeness
whatever<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.830> property<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.090> you're

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
whatever that property is that you're

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.740 
whatever that property is that you're
trademarking<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:34.180> no<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.210> don't<00:02:35.420> think

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
trademarking and so no I don't think

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.000 
trademarking and so no I don't think
it's<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.930> first<00:02:36.230> thing<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.470> need<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.800> do

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
it's the first thing you need to do

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.830 
it's the first thing you need to do
obviously<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.820> think<00:02:37.940> trade<00:02:38.360> marking<00:02:38.720> is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
obviously I think trade marking is

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.770 
obviously I think trade marking is
important<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:40.400> before<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.030> do<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.750> mean

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
important but before you do that I mean

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.950 
important but before you do that I mean
a<00:02:42.170> lot<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.680> people<00:02:42.800> be<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.370> lot<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.960> companies

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
a lot of people be a lot of companies

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.070 
a lot of people be a lot of companies
will<00:02:46.000> put<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.060> name<00:02:47.270> out<00:02:47.390> there<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.690> sounds<00:02:47.810> so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.530 
will put a name out there that sounds so
much<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.290> something<00:02:48.740> else<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:50.060> know<00:02:50.210> and

you if if you get a certain amount of
success<00:03:22.160> I<00:03:22.580> speak<00:03:23.420> about<00:03:23.540> this<00:03:23.840> in<00:03:24.080> another

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
success I speak about this in another

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.250 
success I speak about this in another
video<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.240> don't<00:03:26.570> think<00:03:26.840> I've<00:03:26.959> recorded

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
video that I don't think I've recorded

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.930 
video that I don't think I've recorded
yet<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:27.740> when<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.010> do<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.340> link<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:28.760> video

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
yet so when I do the link to that video

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.940 
yet so when I do the link to that video
I'm<00:03:29.150> going<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.300> put<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.570> right<00:03:29.660> here<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:30.709> up

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
I'm going to put it right here but up

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.920 
I'm going to put it right here but up
and<00:03:31.100> that's<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.790> separate<00:03:32.209> subject<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:32.750> what

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and that's a separate subject but what

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.560 
and that's a separate subject but what
I'm<00:03:33.020> saying<00:03:33.320> is<00:03:33.880> that's<00:03:34.880> why<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.150> think<00:03:35.270> the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
I'm saying is that's why I think the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.340 
I'm saying is that's why I think the
basics<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.709> know<00:03:37.090> what<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.120> will<00:03:38.330> note<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.750> my

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
basics you know what I will note is my

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.340 
basics you know what I will note is my
video<00:03:39.560> about<00:03:40.150> original<00:03:41.150> logos<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.780> will<00:03:42.110> put

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
video about original logos so I will put

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.970 
video about original logos so I will put
that<00:03:42.380> here<00:03:42.770> now<00:03:42.980> how<00:03:43.370> will<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.530> goes<00:03:45.739> back

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
that here now how will that it goes back

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.430 
that here now how will that it goes back
to<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:46.550> basics<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.209> really<00:03:48.080> planning

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
to the basics of really planning

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.500 
to the basics of really planning
backwards<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.190> saying<00:03:49.340> okay<00:03:49.700> let's<00:03:50.270> start

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
backwards and saying okay let's start

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.960 
backwards and saying okay let's start
with<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> name<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.950> logo<00:03:52.160> that<00:03:52.760> looks

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
with a name and a logo that looks

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.820 
with a name and a logo that looks
nothing<00:03:53.209> like<00:03:53.420> anyone<00:03:53.750> else<00:03:54.020> because<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
nothing like anyone else because the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.850 
nothing like anyone else because the
last<00:03:55.010> thing<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:55.250> want<00:03:55.430> to<00:03:55.489> do<00:03:55.610> is<00:03:55.850> put<00:03:56.860> five

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
last thing you want to do is put five

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.390 
last thing you want to do is put five
years<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.700> work<00:03:59.360> into<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.660> brand<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:00.410> find<00:04:01.250> out

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
years of work into a brand and find out
