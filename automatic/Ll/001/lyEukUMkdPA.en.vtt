have<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> genetic<00:00:25.859> link<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.369> what<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.119> eat<00:00:27.300> can

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
have a genetic link so what we eat can

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.179 
have a genetic link so what we eat can
make<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> big<00:00:27.960> difference<00:00:27.990> okay<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.099> are

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
some foods that we want to focus on so a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
some foods that we want to focus on so a
recent<00:00:31.500> study<00:00:31.679> showed<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.099> eating<00:00:32.610> fatty

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
recent study showed that eating fatty

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
recent study showed that eating fatty
fish<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.510> reduce<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.809> risk<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.320> almost<00:00:34.590> 14

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
fish can reduce your risk by almost 14

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 
fish can reduce your risk by almost 14
percent<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:35.880> quite<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.450> fatty<00:00:36.719> fish

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
percent so that's quite a bit fatty fish

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
percent so that's quite a bit fatty fish
contains<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> omega-3<00:00:38.460> fatty<00:00:38.700> acids

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
contains a lot of omega-3 fatty acids

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
contains a lot of omega-3 fatty acids
and<00:00:39.360> that's<00:00:39.480> been<00:00:39.719> shown<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> reduce

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and that's been shown to reduce

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
and that's been shown to reduce
inflammation<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> body<00:00:41.700> inflammation<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
inflammation in the body inflammation is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.479 
inflammation in the body inflammation is
linked<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> an<00:00:43.079> increased<00:00:43.530> breast<00:00:44.100> cancer

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
linked to an increased breast cancer

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.220 
linked to an increased breast cancer
risk<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> definitely<00:00:45.120> want<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> load<00:00:46.050> up

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
risk so you definitely want it load up

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
risk so you definitely want it load up
on<00:00:46.410> those<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.710> research<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.700> mixed<00:00:48.000> on

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
on those and research is mixed on

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.090 
on those and research is mixed on
whether<00:00:48.120> fish<00:00:48.750> oil<00:00:48.989> supplements<00:00:49.649> works<00:00:49.860> if

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
whether fish oil supplements works if

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
whether fish oil supplements works if
it's<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> actual<00:00:50.700> fatty<00:00:51.030> fish<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.050> know

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
it's the actual fatty fish that you know

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.740 
it's the actual fatty fish that you know
creates<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.059> causation<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> would<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
creates this causation so I would just

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.330 
creates this causation so I would just
stick<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> eating<00:00:55.140> fatty<00:00:55.559> fish<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.219> you're

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
stick to eating fatty fish and if you're

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.130 
stick to eating fatty fish and if you're
not<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.699> fish<00:00:56.910> stick<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.449> omega-3

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
not into fish stick to omega-3

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
not into fish stick to omega-3
vegetarian<00:00:58.920> sources<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.399> flax<00:00:59.789> seeds<00:01:00.149> um

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570

vegetables<00:01:03.120> okay<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.719> you're<00:01:03.930> talking<00:01:04.019> about

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
vegetables okay so you're talking about

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.539 
vegetables okay so you're talking about
the<00:01:04.290> fat<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> fish<00:01:04.860> does<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> same<00:01:05.369> apply

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
the fat in the fish does the same apply

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.899 
the fat in the fish does the same apply
for<00:01:06.240> fatty<00:01:06.659> oils<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.890> um<00:01:08.159> olive<00:01:08.820> oil

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
for fatty oils or out there um olive oil

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 
for fatty oils or out there um olive oil
specifically<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.810> particularly<00:01:10.290> great<00:01:10.710> for

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
specifically is particularly great for

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
specifically is particularly great for
preventing<00:01:11.340> breast<00:01:11.490> cancer<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.060> loaded

preventing breast cancer it's loaded

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.499 
preventing breast cancer it's loaded
with<00:01:12.390> monounsaturated<00:01:12.900> fats<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
with monounsaturated fats and and that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149 
with monounsaturated fats and and that
type<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.780> fat<00:01:16.020> doesn't<00:01:16.290> produce<00:01:16.950> free

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
type of fat doesn't produce free

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.859 
type of fat doesn't produce free
radicals<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> body<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.390> free

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
radicals in the body which can free

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
radicals in the body which can free
radicals<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.350> cause<00:01:19.530> cancer<00:01:19.920> growth<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
radicals can cause cancer growth so you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.590 
radicals can cause cancer growth so you
definitely<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> also

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
definitely want to up that it also

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.420 
definitely want to up that it also
contains<00:01:21.979> phytonutrients<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> reduce

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
tumor growth and oleic acid which is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710 
tumor growth and oleic acid which is
actually<00:01:26.460> responsible<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.000> crippling<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
actually responsible for crippling the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.270 
actually responsible for crippling the
actual<00:01:28.140> cancer<00:01:28.560> gene<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.189> responsible

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
actual cancer gene that's responsible

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
actual cancer gene that's responsible
for<00:01:29.729> breast<00:01:30.030> cancer<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.509> olive<00:01:30.810> oil<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> really

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
for breast cancer so olive oil is really

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
for breast cancer so olive oil is really
great<00:01:31.740> Wow<00:01:31.950> pretty<00:01:32.220> powerful<00:01:32.700> stuff

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
great Wow pretty powerful stuff

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
great Wow pretty powerful stuff
absolutely<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:33.780> protease<00:01:34.170> should<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.590> be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
absolutely what protease should we be
