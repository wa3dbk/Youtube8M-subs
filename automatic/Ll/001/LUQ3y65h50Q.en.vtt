I<00:01:48.650> was<00:01:49.460> leaving<00:01:49.640> something<00:01:50.030> I'd<00:01:50.480> spent<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:51.050> long

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
I was leaving something I'd spent a long

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.670 
I was leaving something I'd spent a long
time<00:01:51.340> creating<00:01:52.840> if<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.990> had<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.290> do<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.560> all<00:01:54.650> over

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
time creating if I had to do it all over

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.220 
time creating if I had to do it all over
again<00:01:55.120> I'd<00:01:56.120> obviously<00:01:56.360> do<00:01:56.960> things

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
again I'd obviously do things

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.170 
again I'd obviously do things
differently

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
differently

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.770 
differently
but<00:01:59.180> I'd<00:01:59.300> still<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.930> left<00:02:00.460> Miami<00:02:01.460> for<00:02:01.760> me<00:02:01.940> has
