00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:06.550
 Let's make an eggplant and feta salad 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.670
 In eggplants, remove the stem, cut the eggplants in 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.169
 four pieces and cut into plates. 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:37.160
 Put the eggplants in a pan heated with olive oil 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.940
 (I add 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil), many 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.309
 Do not add oils, otherwise eggplants will absorb a lot 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.570
 fat 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.949
 When the eggplants are lightly fried, salt them 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.370
 to taste and then fry until cooked. 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.390
 Then I turn off the fire, cover the eggplant 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.740
 and leave to cool. 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.110
 Shred half a small onion (I use 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:19.990
 for this grater), or very thinly cut. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 Sprinkle onions with sugar and leave until 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.430
 we will prepare the remaining products for the salad. 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.659
 Hard-boiled eggs cut into four pieces 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.080
 and cut into plates. 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:51.220
 Red pepper is cleaned from the seeds, chop, so 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.670
 pepper slices are very thin or thin 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.130
 cut it. 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.340
 Cut the tomatoes into small cubes. 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:16.550
 Feta cheese cut into cubes. 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:55.480
 Combine eggplants, onions, eggs, red peppers and tomatoes, 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.550
 mix the salad. 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:14.840
 Add feta cheese, sprinkle oregano salad (I take 1/2 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.820
 teaspoon oregano), you can add oregano 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.900
 taste. 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.920
 Sprinkle with olive oil (2 tsp.), And very carefully. 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:39.540
 Stir in order not to damage the Feta cheese cubes. 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:53.080
