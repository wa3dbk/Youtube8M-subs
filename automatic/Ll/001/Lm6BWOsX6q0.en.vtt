00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.510 
alright in this video we'll show you how
to<00:00:05.600> change<00:00:05.960> data<00:00:06.350> fields<00:00:06.830> on<00:00:06.950> your<00:00:06.980> Garmin<00:00:07.370> map

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
to change data fields on your Garmin map

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.779 
to change data fields on your Garmin map
62<00:00:08.410> specifically<00:00:09.410> trying<00:00:09.769> to<00:00:09.860> maximize<00:00:10.579> the

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:10.789 
62 specifically trying to maximize the

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.579 
62 specifically trying to maximize the
number<00:00:10.820> of<00:00:11.089> data<00:00:11.329> fields<00:00:11.599> so<00:00:12.200> let's<00:00:12.410> say<00:00:12.559> that

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
number of data fields so let's say that

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.259 
number of data fields so let's say that
you're<00:00:12.889> not<00:00:13.009> interested<00:00:13.549> in<00:00:13.669> the<00:00:13.820> graphical

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
you're not interested in the graphical

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.380 
you're not interested in the graphical
elements<00:00:14.780> such<00:00:15.199> as<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:15.589> map<00:00:15.860> or<00:00:16.309> compass<00:00:16.390> you

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
elements such as the map or compass you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.660 
elements such as the map or compass you
want<00:00:17.600> to<00:00:17.720> see<00:00:17.900> just<00:00:18.110> look<00:00:18.320> at<00:00:18.440> data<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.310> the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
want to see just look at data so the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.090
