the<00:00:47.579> platform<00:00:48.030> up<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.210> quickly<00:00:48.450> as<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the platform up as quickly as was the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
the platform up as quickly as was the
best<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> logical<00:00:49.860> mind<00:00:50.070> thinking

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
best that's the logical mind thinking

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.639 
best that's the logical mind thinking
that's<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.700> logical<00:00:50.850> mind<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.050> may<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.410> be

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that's a logical mind but it may not be

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.310 
that's a logical mind but it may not be
the<00:00:53.460> most<00:00:53.489> effective<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> flat

thing<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.990> strength<00:01:13.320> training<00:01:13.530> okay<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
thing is strength training okay and the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.100 
thing is strength training okay and the
reason<00:01:15.090> why<00:01:15.360> strength<00:01:15.659> training<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.990> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
reason why strength training is so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
reason why strength training is so
important<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.220> looses<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.210> Prince<00:01:18.479> up

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
important is it looses you Prince up

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.359 
important is it looses you Prince up
some<00:01:18.960> muscle<00:01:19.140> mass<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> boosts<00:01:20.130> your

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
some muscle mass and boosts your

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.899 
some muscle mass and boosts your
metabolism<00:01:21.259> okay<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:23.340> increase

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
metabolism okay and that increase

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.200 
metabolism okay and that increase
metabolism<00:01:24.210> creates<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:26.009> only<00:01:26.210> active

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
metabolism creates not only active

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.020 
metabolism creates not only active
calories<00:01:27.689> burning<00:01:28.680> during<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.520> time<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.939> do

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
calories burning during the time you do

calories burning during the time you do
the<00:01:30.150> exercise<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.930> also<00:01:31.079> facets<00:01:31.680> calorie

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the exercise but also facets calorie

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.370 
the exercise but also facets calorie
burning<00:01:32.369> when<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.600> rest<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
burning when you are at rest because you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.620 
burning when you are at rest because you
were<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> higher<00:01:34.740> antibody<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.520> now<00:01:36.240> first

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
were a higher antibody way now first

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
were a higher antibody way now first
ladies<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.920> also<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.520> strength<00:01:38.790> training

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
ladies can also do strength training

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
ladies can also do strength training
because<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.840> don't<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> bulk<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
because they don't want to bulk up it is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.340 
because they don't want to bulk up it is
going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.009> build<00:01:41.250> stronger<00:01:42.030> more<00:01:42.990> active

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going to build stronger more active

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
going to build stronger more active
muscles<00:01:43.770> which<00:01:44.280> gives<00:01:44.520> them<00:01:44.670> passive<00:01:45.030> burn<00:01:45.240> as

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
muscles which gives them passive burn as

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.640 
muscles which gives them passive burn as
well<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.470> grunty<00:01:47.189> below<00:01:47.369> us<00:01:47.610> seems<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:49.049> seems

XV d statically again that's right so

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.080 
XV d statically again that's right so
find<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.470> your

find that your
sugar<00:03:48.510> levels<00:03:48.810> Appetit<00:03:49.260> yes<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:51.060> he<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.180> pick

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
sugar levels Appetit yes but he can pick

up<00:03:51.660> his<00:03:51.690> eye<00:03:52.069> that's<00:03:53.069> right<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.640> will<00:03:53.970> not

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
up his eye that's right but will not

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.570 
up his eye that's right but will not
measure<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.660> cut<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.560> engines<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.129> empirical

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
maintain and just ride imagine and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.080 
maintain and just ride imagine and
that's<00:03:58.769> right

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.800 

this<00:04:02.300> were<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:03.110> go

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
this were to go

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.140
