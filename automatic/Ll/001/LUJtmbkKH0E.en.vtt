in<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.689> video<00:00:03.899> you're<00:00:04.319> gonna<00:00:04.440> save<00:00:05.040> the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
in this video you're gonna save the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.760 
in this video you're gonna save the
difference<00:00:05.430> between<00:00:05.819> running<00:00:06.450> an<00:00:07.080> engine<00:00:07.350> on

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
difference between running an engine on

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.990 
difference between running an engine on
petrol<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.700> methanol<00:00:09.660> fuel<00:00:10.490> in<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.639> whipper

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
petrol and methanol fuel in this whipper

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.350 
petrol and methanol fuel in this whipper
snippers<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:13.380> currently<00:00:13.799> petrol<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.670> I'm

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
snippers it's currently petrol and I'm

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.269 
snippers it's currently petrol and I'm
going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.960> see<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.920> difference

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
going to get you to see the difference

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.670 
going to get you to see the difference
when<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.850> revs<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.570> different<00:00:18.900> between<00:00:19.170> petrol

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
when it revs to different between petrol

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.779 
when it revs to different between petrol
and<00:00:19.859> methanol<00:00:20.279> fuel<00:00:21.020> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.289> methanol

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
and methanol fuel this is the methanol

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
and methanol fuel this is the methanol
which<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.210> putting<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:25.010> pure

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
which I'm going to be putting in pure

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.450 
which I'm going to be putting in pure
racing<00:00:27.260> which<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.410> prepared<00:00:28.830> earlier<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.310> this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
racing which I prepared earlier in this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.479 
racing which I prepared earlier in this
bottle<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.650> make<00:00:31.650> sure<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:32.099> you're<00:00:32.219> handling

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
bottle so make sure when you're handling

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.740 
bottle so make sure when you're handling
this<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> wear<00:00:33.149> gloves<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> everything

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
this you wear gloves and everything

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.220 
this you wear gloves and everything
because<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.500> car<00:00:34.860> Sierra<00:00:35.160> genic<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> now

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
because this car Sierra genic and now

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
because this car Sierra genic and now
I'm<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.860> start<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> methanol<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
I'm going to start up the methanol that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.639 
I'm going to start up the methanol that
we<00:00:39.420> piston<00:00:39.690> apart<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we piston apart and you can see the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
we piston apart and you can see the
difference<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.250> revs<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.059> listen<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
difference in revs I'm not listen to the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:01:13.870 
difference in revs I'm not listen to the
waves

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.670 

petrol<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.420> gonna<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.170> methanol

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
petrol so now I'm gonna the methanol

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:31.429 
petrol so now I'm gonna the methanol
fuel<00:01:17.009> inside<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:24.229> drain<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:30.350> creating<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
fuel inside now drain this creating the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:46.170 
fuel inside now drain this creating the
pickle

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:59.760 

enough<00:01:46.990> during<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:50.010> methanol

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.850 

that's<00:02:00.770> too<00:02:01.010> much<00:02:02.680> all<00:02:03.680> right<00:02:06.610> difference<00:02:07.610> now
