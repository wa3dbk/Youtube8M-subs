00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi friends and today i will introduce you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:12.690
 with an unusual tropical fruit 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.610
 called beat apple in translation this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.150
 means apple 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.150
 bell still has names 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 royal apple and love apple 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:32.570
 but it is very difficult to say from the first 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.309
 look that this apple tastes 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.629
 reminds 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:42.079
 not a sweet watermelon, or here I personally 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.690
 there was some kind of association 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.410
 soft and radish 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.239
 with a sweetish taste and a bit so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 smack 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.960
 Coca-Cola sounds funny but 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.379
 really unusual some 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 incomprehensible taste that is absolutely not 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:09.260
 similar to the apple taste of an apple it is very 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 useful in its properties 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.170
 contains vitamin c contains tannins 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.009
 substances that fight with 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.729
 these tannic pathogens 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.990
 substances 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.460
 they kill Staphylococcus aureus here 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.530
 cut it we see white such pulp 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.930
 and it even resembles the consistency 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.740
 radish pulp and quite enough 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.119
 loose rite which apples 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.560
 these are such exotic apples but 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.860
 looks like a pear 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.880
 very beautiful 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.880
 such 5 kilogram 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.090
 Exotic here is pea sprouts 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 which is very popular in their australia 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.489
 added to salads even in restaurants 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.790
 can be in salads see pea sprouts well 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.700
 not surprising because in them 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.950
 contains a large amount of vitamin c 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.750
 and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.320
 high amount of proteins also 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.420
 pea cast contains an enzyme and this 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:41.540
 enzymes that improve 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.150
 human digestion is such a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.970
 packing in the usual supermarket is worth 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.519
 somewhere a half dollar so this 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.620
 inexpensive kind of green well and very 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.269
 common and this is Australian 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.450
 sweet corn just such upakovochku 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:07.190
 can be bought at a regular supermarket for 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.320
 two dollars well you know i'm not a fan 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.329
 corn but here it is this corn I 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.360
 I love it because it is so 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.750
 tasty and tender sweet than 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.200
 wonderful corn 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.370
 it is prepared to cook as usual 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.880
 boiling water for about 20-30 minutes 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.590
 addictions who likes watermelon like 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.600
 Australian watermelon it is a little bit 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 different in that there are no pits in it 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.230
 absolutely consistency it is also more 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.380
 so you know here if you hear it 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.959
 tougher so crispy 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.980
 for example, got used to when she lived in Russia 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:56.200
 like a watermelon eat if it is ripe it is juicy 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:01.730
 even here the juice flows and here it is not more 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:04.040
 he is juicy but he is tougher 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.989
 crisp voyage he straight crunches very 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.359
 strong 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.560
 Well, the cost of watermelons is now now 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.040
 season we have two and a half autumn 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.940
 dollar 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:24.570
 kilogram that is absolutely not expensive 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.620
 Watermelons are very sweet and delicious well 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:36.150
 A little bit different in them is that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:39.090
 pitted it in favor of it that he 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.110
 tougher it is for me a little bit 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.720
 minus the fact that pitted is very 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.009
 okay no problem no pits no 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.130
 problems sell them usually not intact but 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:57.020
 cut here and so on quarters happens 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.639
 in half so buying here such 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.870
 watermelon 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:07.590
 you will pay 2 dollars somewhere 2-3 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:11.270
 dollars if you buy a quarter this 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.270
 somewhere a kilo and a half kilograms
