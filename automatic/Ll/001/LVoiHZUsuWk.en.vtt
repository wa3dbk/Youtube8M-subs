complete with his name other than the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
fact that the resolution is affixed 1024

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.339 
fact that the resolution is affixed 1024
by<00:03:00.590> 768<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:02.150> if<00:03:02.239> your<00:03:02.390> monitor<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.870> larger

by 768 so if your monitor is larger
resolution<00:03:03.650> yours<00:03:04.220> widescreen<00:03:04.610> there<00:03:05.330> will

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
resolution yours widescreen there will

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.420 
resolution yours widescreen there will
not<00:03:05.599> take<00:03:05.780> advantage<00:03:06.319> of<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.620> full<00:03:06.830> screen<00:03:07.220> or

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
not take advantage of the full screen or

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.250 
not take advantage of the full screen or
of<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.180> resolution<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.989> will<00:03:09.110> be

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
of the resolution and it will be

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.770 
of the resolution and it will be
pixelated<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.160> still<00:03:10.730> remain<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.150> 4:3<00:03:11.630> aspect

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.559 
pixelated and still remain in 4:3 aspect
ratio<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.739> think<00:03:13.459> there<00:03:13.610> should<00:03:13.849> be<00:03:13.880> an<00:03:14.120> option

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
ratio I think there should be an option

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.479 
ratio I think there should be an option
to<00:03:14.599> change<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.989> resolution<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:16.310> that's

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
to change the resolution but that's

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.680 
to change the resolution but that's
something<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:17.030> stopped<00:03:17.390> noticing

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
something that you stopped noticing

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.330 
something that you stopped noticing
after<00:03:18.230> playing<00:03:18.470> for<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.739> few<00:03:18.890> minutes<00:03:19.190> because

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
after playing for a few minutes because

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.220 
after playing for a few minutes because
the<00:03:19.549> game<00:03:19.730> still<00:03:20.060> looks<00:03:20.299> really<00:03:20.390> good<00:03:20.810> even<00:03:20.959> if
