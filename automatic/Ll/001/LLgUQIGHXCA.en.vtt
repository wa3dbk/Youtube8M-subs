00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.600
 today we are going to show you one of the models of the printer line 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.150
 hp laser this laser collapsed the three thousand 102 double b 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.470
 This is characterized by using one of the simplest models of printers 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.560
 laser in terms of performance and speed but with some 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.650
 advanced features such as the incorporation of wireless connection 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.900
 and a tray of priority sheets unlike the interface printers 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.990
 the lasers that use tone to investment communism which allows 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.660
 a greater number of impressions before its replacement 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.980
 which significantly reduces printing costs the advantage is that this 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.680
 model implies only in black and white inside the house we find a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.989
 quick installation guide a civic honda iberski hp program a cable 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.650
 feeding a cable usbl installation the laser printer of the properly 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.310
 said and sing a black print of start one of the main 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.250
 differences that we found with respect to the females of the farms of jareño use 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.990
 is that the villages are 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.479
 does not include a transformer station itself is inside 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.610
 of the equipment so we only have to connect the cable 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.049
 power included to be able to light the potatoes or detail is that as 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:18.720
 in most printers 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.320
 With wireless connection the USB cable is included to use it during the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.290
 installation process this model comes in totally black color with a 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.770
 glossy finish the compact size considering that it is a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.210
 laser printer isl 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.500
 approximate mentions are about 35 centimeters long twenty-four of 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.380
 depth and 20 tall being one of the smaller models of hp for 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.630
 this kind of people in the back of the unit we find the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.680
 right side 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060
 the connector for the power cable and the usb port 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.960
 to connect it to the pc and from the left side we find a slot for a 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 security cable that in centers at the top we can see the tray 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.860
 challenge of the printed sheets which contains a removable extender for the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.840
 cases that are printed many others on the left side we see the control panel 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.460
 where all the buttons are located to be able to configure and control the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.080
 printer 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.549
 in this panel we find the vote from the top down 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.069
 Unite while enabling and disabling wireless functionality 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.379
 below in the justified show 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.609
 or the guadalmez function that does not allow us to know if we are connected or not 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.079
 to the usi network the printer is trying to connect in third place 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.349
 we have in the light of attention that indicates us some problem with the 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.249
 printing since the print cartridge embroidery is open 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.489
 printer is to tie us 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.340
 then we have a green light that when it is on and without blinking 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.810
 tells us that the printer is ready to print 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.020
 and finally we have the shell button that allows us to cancel a 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.290
 printing in progress and if I preside for five seconds we printed a sheet of 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.630
 printer settings the top tray of the printer can 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.430
 be open 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.689
 which allows us to perform various maintenance tasks such as sar 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.850
 redistribute the thunderous cartridge change the cartridge perform cleaning 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.599
 the prodigies among other things for more information on these tasks 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.969
 We recommend a detailed reading of the printer's hand on the front of the 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.150
 single button model 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.530
 in a general sense of the team who contributes that when opening the nba access to 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.439
 sheet input tray this model has two input trays one 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.569
 lower tray esplá that we will mostly use and possesses a capacity 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.009
 for approximately 150 sheets 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:33.089
 and up ripstein with another inbox trays called tray of 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.499
 priority with a capacity of 10 works only this tray of high activity 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:42.340
 It serves to be able to print works in works of different format and sizes 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.330
 to indoor facilities 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.060
 for example if we want to print a transparency an envelope and we do not want 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.000
 take all the chances in the lower tray and have to adjust the tracks 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.619
 of the printer again and again loved entry goals own day 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.589
 rafita de lance of the work of way in any of those can be installed 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:05.279
 any type of sheet supported by the printer and also the plot has 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:08.779
 an extensive list and the one that allows to use few bicentennial also 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.889
 Another novelty of this model is the installation process includes a 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.659
 functionality called well pérez martínez a 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.000
 Today, it is followed by HP, so the printer must be drawn to the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.020
 electrical current and connect it to the computer through the vote would be time 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.360
 once made 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.930
 the company detected the windows version and begins the process of 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.800
 installation of drivers and we treat automatically and the user 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.069
 You should only follow the on-screen instructions in the case of 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.930
 that the function and left urges to not work only should be reduced to 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.900
 be included that follow the steps blankets the high allowing only should 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.990
 support all windows versions 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.139
 from windows xp to seconds are made with another was going to be included and also 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.240
 can install bonuses and computers with linux in addition to the cable connection 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.940
 hbo sbx tm is a wireless connection pose which supports all types 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.169
 of networks do you with router 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.360
 without robust young networks with double security say goodbye 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.850
 which is a very important functionality so that people who 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.870
 have several computers in his house had cristina 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.160
 or they tell you or vox since having all the computers and a printer 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.190
 connected to be a wireless network you can print files from any 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.830
 of them 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.889
 no need to transfer files or have to use a computer 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.860
 additional as a print server this printer model uses 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.890
 print cartridges detonating hp Seoul 28 5 to commonly called 85 a is 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.110
 true one only has a black tune 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.520
 there is a performance of my scenes impressions approximately which 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.110
 escoto times more than a standard ink cartridge we should clarify that 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.560
 the tunnel included with the printer this smaller capacity 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.060
 and josé a lower performance the print injury is up to 19 pages 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.990
 per minute 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.180
 in normal quality 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.389
 in conclusion the hp laserjet pro p min 102 9 is an ideal model for a 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.510
 person who makes a lot of black and white prints 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.480
 as for example a student a professional or a small office his 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.420
 main advantage over an inter printer are first of all a 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.699
 Low printing cost 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.759
 much higher performance of the print cartridge 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.539
 the 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.210
 the ideal for printing time the only disadvantage is that we can not 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.020
 print in colors the wireless connection of this model gives you a 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.550
 greater fertility at home your office is by many computers allows me 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.139
 print from either side and decreases the amount of cables your 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.910
 compact size and the installation process has 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.950
 very easy and direct like its use all this without influencing the 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.920
 print quality which 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.040
 they are characteristics to stand out of all the printers laser
