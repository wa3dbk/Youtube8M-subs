hi harm here a couple of days ago I did

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.240 
hi harm here a couple of days ago I did
a<00:00:13.769> test<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.759> Kelly<00:00:15.120> Kettle<00:00:15.800> using<00:00:16.800> carbon

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
a test on this Kelly Kettle using carbon

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.620 
a test on this Kelly Kettle using carbon
felt<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.789> alcohol<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.260> burn<00:00:19.470> chamber<00:00:19.770> and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
felt and alcohol in the burn chamber and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.259 
felt and alcohol in the burn chamber and
Khan<00:00:21.630> had<00:00:21.840> thermal<00:00:22.320> runaway<00:00:22.519> so<00:00:23.519> flames<00:00:23.970> were

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
Khan had thermal runaway so flames were

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.089 
Khan had thermal runaway so flames were
shooting<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.260> top<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> Kelly

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
shooting out of the top of the Kelly

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.269 
shooting out of the top of the Kelly
Kettle<00:00:27.140> one<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> things<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.650> tried<00:00:28.980> was

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
Kettle one of the things I tried was

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.359 
Kettle one of the things I tried was
this<00:00:29.490> disc<00:00:30.090> where<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> punched<00:00:31.500> five<00:00:31.769> holes<00:00:32.130> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
this disc where I punched five holes in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.110 
this disc where I punched five holes in
it<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.669> try<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> limit<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> air<00:00:34.200> flow<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it to try to limit the air flow the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.930 
it to try to limit the air flow the
flame<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.570> coming<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:36.989> through<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
flame for coming up through this and

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
flame for coming up through this and
once<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.090> put<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.050> flame<00:00:40.500> stopped

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
once I put this on the flame stopped

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.729 
once I put this on the flame stopped
well<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.360> know<00:00:42.450> how<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.079> go<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> bed<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

well you know how you you go to bed and
you<00:00:43.800> start<00:00:44.129> thinking<00:00:44.340> about<00:00:44.610> things

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you start thinking about things

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.810

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
through this anymore where what happened

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.549 
through this anymore where what happened
but<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> alcohol<00:00:51.420> vapors<00:00:52.079> would<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> coming

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but the alcohol vapors would be coming

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.250 
but the alcohol vapors would be coming
up<00:00:52.739> through<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> did

shelves okay let me go to I'm on camera

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.170 
shelves okay let me go to I'm on camera
to<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.939> burning<00:01:26.939> away

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
there so let me put this little disc on

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.100 
there so let me put this little disc on
without<00:01:29.880> burning<00:01:30.150> myself<00:01:32.090> see<00:01:33.090> how<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
without burning myself see how the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.109 
without burning myself see how the
flames<00:01:34.439> went<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.890> flames<00:01:35.549> came<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.939> through

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
flames went out flames came up through

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.800 
flames went out flames came up through
but<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.450> went<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.020> watch<00:01:37.229> this

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
but they went out but now watch this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.490 
but they went out but now watch this
come<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:43.729> look<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.850> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
come on look at that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.990 
come on look at that
so<00:01:47.500> there's<00:01:47.740> still<00:01:47.890> alcohol<00:01:48.460> coming<00:01:48.760> up

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
so there's still alcohol coming up

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.700 
so there's still alcohol coming up
through<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.670> just<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:53.260> metal

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
through that it's just that the metal

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.080 
through that it's just that the metal
must<00:01:53.890> have<00:01:54.010> cooled<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.369> off<00:01:54.460> enough<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:55.000> it

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
must have cooled it off enough that it

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.219 
must have cooled it off enough that it
didn't<00:01:55.420> ignite<00:01:57.570> doesn't<00:01:58.570> go<00:01:58.630> up<00:01:58.720> quite<00:01:59.020> as

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
didn't ignite doesn't go up quite as

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.639 
didn't ignite doesn't go up quite as
high<00:02:00.150> but<00:02:01.150> it's<00:02:01.360> still<00:02:01.630> there<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.320> don't

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
high but it's still there so I don't

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.889 
high but it's still there so I don't
know<00:02:05.800> I<00:02:06.009> think<00:02:06.610> this<00:02:06.759> will<00:02:06.909> still<00:02:07.149> work<00:02:07.180> as<00:02:07.659> far

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
know I think this will still work as far

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.760 
know I think this will still work as far
as<00:02:08.050> slowing<00:02:08.440> down<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.979> heat<00:02:09.250> escaping<00:02:10.650> but<00:02:11.650> as

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
as slowing down the heat escaping but as

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.530 
as slowing down the heat escaping but as
far<00:02:12.040> as<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.370> flames<00:02:12.610> coming<00:02:13.030> out<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.180> top

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
far as the flames coming out the top

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
far as the flames coming out the top
doesn't<00:02:14.500> seem<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> whole<00:02:15.069> lot<00:02:15.250> for<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:16.560> so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
doesn't seem to do a whole lot for it so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.810 
doesn't seem to do a whole lot for it so
I<00:02:17.590> just<00:02:17.860> thought<00:02:17.950> I'd<00:02:18.100> share<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.400> with<00:02:18.670> you

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
I just thought I'd share that with you

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.360 
I just thought I'd share that with you
in<00:02:18.850> case<00:02:19.150> others<00:02:19.510> tried<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:21.160> there's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
in case others tried this but there's

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.070 
in case others tried this but there's
still<00:02:21.610> vapors<00:02:22.090> coming<00:02:22.390> out<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> top<00:02:22.900> and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
still vapors coming out of the top and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.130

you<00:02:23.140> have<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.410> be<00:02:23.530> careful<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:25.140> thank
