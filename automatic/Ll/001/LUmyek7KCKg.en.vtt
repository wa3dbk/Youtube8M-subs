the time with buildings at the moment is

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.879 
the time with buildings at the moment is
a<00:04:10.400> lack<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.120> understanding<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:12.049> well<00:04:12.680> what

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
a lack of understanding of well what

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.890 
a lack of understanding of well what

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
should we do first there are so many

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.120 
should we do first there are so many
things<00:04:15.170> we<00:04:15.319> need<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.560> do<00:04:15.650> with<00:04:15.799> this<00:04:15.859> building

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
things we need to do with this building

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.340

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
on you can save much larger amounts of

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.279 
on you can save much larger amounts of
money<00:04:27.860> later<00:04:28.370> on<00:04:28.639> as<00:04:28.870> energy<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:29.900> water
