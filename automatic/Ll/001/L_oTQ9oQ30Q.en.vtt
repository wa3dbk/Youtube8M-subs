00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 and in an agronomist’s unique online project 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.790
 every house 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.900
 when the bloom begins to bloom 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.730
 Russia Tomato 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.580
 need to hold about the greenhouse 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 pickling tomato plants pass 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.179
 in the following way 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.120
 need to be approached individually each 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:31.450
 grow if the soil here is dull 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:36.490
 who peres the bitter necessary leg 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 respect the soil just pure water and here 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:44.740
 externally, it is necessary to water with warm water 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.500
 temperature should be below 24 degrees 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:53.170
 and that the water does not fall on the olive leaves 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.660
 spend the morning hours 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.659
 after that, a description is required 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.200
 air now between heights 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.340
 our solution which 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.980
 so as 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.610
 for this do not drink water and we add 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.910
 liquid organic drowned usually 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.750
 bases 1 to 10 liters of water can 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.310
 add one tablespoon and also 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.340
 add its water-soluble fertilizer 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.369
 will make up which contains nitrogen meaning 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.660
 burned and trace elements copper and molybdenum 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.580
 pore mark us too with tablespoons 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.790
 It’s good to be dissolved in 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.790
 water 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.560
 added and everything went well 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.729
 dissolved here can your 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.869
 Our plant color anime show for the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.740
 small 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.899
 therefore enough to wear under each 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.810
 The plant on 0 5 liters of solutions takes but 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.810
 5 to 3 solutions and caution 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.489
 after we guys are not our times 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.290
 Prices look if the soil is enough 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.140
 moistened 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.340
 You can mulch our plants here 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.340
 light and sprinkle 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.360
 and deliver our guests another krasinets and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.420
 here you on them under each try to 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.269
 a little plants shake off it is done 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.500
 morning hours so that it passes and better 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.409
 pollination of plants 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.989
 then the fruits will be tied more and 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.989
 marveling to heal breathe
