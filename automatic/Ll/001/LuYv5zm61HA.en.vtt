more<00:01:05.519> aware<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.330> some<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> these<00:01:06.659> sounds

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
more aware of like some of these sounds

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.370 
more aware of like some of these sounds
in<00:01:07.170> Korean<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.369> could<00:01:08.549> use<00:01:08.840> several<00:01:09.840> symbols

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
in Korean you could use several symbols

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.380 
in Korean you could use several symbols
for<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> whole<00:01:10.950> sound<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> AAA<00:01:11.970> sound

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
for the whole sound or for the AAA sound

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.179 
for the whole sound or for the AAA sound
and<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.869> start<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.380> notice<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:13.950> ones

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and so you start to notice which ones

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
and so you start to notice which ones
are<00:01:14.340> used<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:15.150> start<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> notice<00:01:15.780> how<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
are used you start to notice how the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.499 
are used you start to notice how the
words<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.979> grouped<00:01:17.369> together<00:01:17.549> bunched

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
words are grouped together bunched

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
words are grouped together bunched
together<00:01:18.799> so<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.729> improves<00:01:21.299> my

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
together so and I think this improves my

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
together so and I think this improves my
reading<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.020> proves<00:01:22.259> my<00:01:22.409> comprehension<00:01:23.060> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
reading and proves my comprehension so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.440 
reading and proves my comprehension so
the<00:01:24.210> writing<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> writing<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.150> even

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the writing I see the writing and even

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929
