00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 yes instead it passes 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:21.420
 Johann sebastian bach it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.439
 wrote an incredible amount of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.029
 beautiful music as well as scarlet 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.330
 with the difference that scarlet is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.529
 passed into history above all 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.870
 undeservedly because then he wrote 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 he too works great sacred music 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.930
 value, however, has gone down in history for 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.820
 these 555 plays that he wrote 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 when he worked in spain at the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.640
 queen and wrote them in the last 25 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.309
 years of life is a story really 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.120
 fascinating that would deserve one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.729
 fiction 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.519
 actually while bak wrote about 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.309
 all in all genres from the violin alone 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.640
 to the cello only to the vast has 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 wrote the passions wrote of balls 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.770
 bourgeois wrote for each organic e 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 any existing tool anywhere e 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
 wherever he got his hands the music was 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 there now I will do a lot of his song 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.640
 simple which is a choral choir 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.790
 Christmas in fact the if I can see 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 it is practically dedicated to Jesus 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.780
 newborn baby and then on this 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.780
 I will do my improvisations 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.780
 thank you
