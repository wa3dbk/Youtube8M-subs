00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.350
 makeup eyes ripped with trick step 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.350
 Step 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.500
 first we apply the foundation 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 with a brush and we work it well for 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.410
 that there is no cut 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 then we take an illuminator a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 concealer or a make-up base a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.520
 little clearer and we apply it in the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.380
 center right in this area we unify the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.380
 eyelid with a shadow in cream 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.120
 you can do it directly with the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.309
 fingers or with a brush 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.850
 Now let's take a piece of tape 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.610
 adhesive you remove excess glue and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.910
 you place it as a guide without pasting it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.550
 too 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.780
 we take a light pink and apply it 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.780
 on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.710
 to touch we are downloading product and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.880
 with a further shadow clarita let 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 to illuminate under the eyebrow 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.210
 in the center of the eye and in the lacrimal 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.330
 now let's use this violet tone 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.800
 and we apply it right in the fold 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.800
 we slide the brush 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.230
 and we are working it and with a more 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.730
 dark let's intensify the extreme 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:35.390
 from outside in the crease and following the 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.390
 we remove the tape carefully 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.440
 and to join the makeup we apply a 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.030
 little shade flush with the eyelashes 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.820
 the bottom 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.040
 and a little bit of concealer in the area 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.049
 down if necessary and we could 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.150
 leave like that because I love it or if I 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.150
 you want a little more charged we do 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.070
 an eyeliner we are going to use a brush 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.960
 bevelled but you can use a brush 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.260
 fine yes or if it's easier first 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.870
 we make the guide 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.869
 and we are giving it the thickness taking the 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.250
 brush by sliding it from the end of 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.250
 out to the center 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.760
 and we make up the water line in black 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.760
 a little mascara 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.600
 blusher in the center of the cheeks 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.650
 and on the lips something very natural 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.460
