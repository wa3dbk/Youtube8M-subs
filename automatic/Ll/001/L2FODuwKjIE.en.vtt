talked to traxxas about this and first

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.830 
talked to traxxas about this and first
thing<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.940> they're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> tell<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.630> is

thing that they're going to tell you is

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.189 
thing that they're going to tell you is
to<00:00:13.200> take<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.250> drill<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:14.639> file<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.450> open<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
to take a drill or file and open up the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.810 
to take a drill or file and open up the
pickup<00:00:16.789> which<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.940> did<00:00:18.289> right<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.859> after

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
pickup which I did right here and after

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.929 
pickup which I did right here and after
doing<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.680> still<00:00:22.680> had<00:00:22.859> problems<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.609> could

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
doing that I still had problems I could

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.170 
doing that I still had problems I could
only<00:00:24.090> get<00:00:24.269> about<00:00:25.099> six<00:00:26.099> minutes<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.760> driving

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
only get about six minutes or so driving

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.859 
only get about six minutes or so driving
and<00:00:28.010> it<00:00:29.010> would<00:00:29.160> go<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.609> overheat<00:00:30.179> mode<00:00:30.390> which

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and it would go into overheat mode which

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.920 
and it would go into overheat mode which
is<00:00:30.900> no<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.489> did<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> couple<00:00:33.690> more

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
is no good so I did a couple more

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.740 
is no good so I did a couple more
modifications<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.309> we're<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.600> if

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
modifications then we're going to see if

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.799 
modifications then we're going to see if
this<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.710> help<00:00:39.320> hey<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.710> thing<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.010> did<00:00:41.219> was

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
this does help hey first thing I did was

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
this does help hey first thing I did was
get<00:00:42.809> bigger<00:00:43.020> tubing<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:46.250> less

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
get bigger tubing this is less

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.330 
get bigger tubing this is less
restrictive<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.210> should<00:00:48.750> help<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.980> flow

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
restrictive and should help with a flow

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.990 
restrictive and should help with a flow
and<00:00:50.690> also<00:00:51.690> what<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> did<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.710> order<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> get<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and also what I did in order to get this

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.920 
and also what I did in order to get this
to<00:00:54.239> fit<00:00:55.520> drill<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.670> haul<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.719> going

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to fit drill your haul out that's going

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
to fit drill your haul out that's going
to<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:59.010> drilled<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> believe<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to have to get drilled out I believe it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.929 
to have to get drilled out I believe it
was<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> 7<00:01:01.460> 730<00:01:02.460> second<00:01:03.000> screw<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.189> drill<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
was a 7 730 second screw a drill that I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.420 
was a 7 730 second screw a drill that I
used<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.740> also<00:01:09.260> yeah<00:01:10.260> you're<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
used and also yeah you're not going to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.510 
used and also yeah you're not going to
be<00:01:11.520> able<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.729> see<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.979> this<00:01:13.979> little<00:01:14.220> nozzle

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
be able to see it but this little nozzle

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.510 
be able to see it but this little nozzle
right<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.330> had<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.600> drill<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.520> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
right here I had to drill that out that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.310 
right here I had to drill that out that
was<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> seven<00:01:18.950> 64th<00:01:20.630> drill<00:01:21.630> bit<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.020> used

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
was a seven 64th drill bit that I used

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.350 
was a seven 64th drill bit that I used
for<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> once<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> bigger

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
for that so once you make this bigger

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.609 
for that so once you make this bigger
then<00:01:27.740> you're<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> split<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.619> nice

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
then you're going to split it so nice

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.149 
then you're going to split it so nice
cold<00:01:32.009> water<00:01:32.250> goes<00:01:33.090> directly<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.799> speed

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
cold water goes directly to your speed

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.109 
cold water goes directly to your speed
control<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:39.020> where<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.110> splits<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.880> going

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
control and where it splits it's going

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.389 
control and where it splits it's going
to<00:01:42.180> come<00:01:42.390> straight<00:01:43.079> over<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> motor<00:01:44.009> you're

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
to come straight over to a motor you're

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.120 
to come straight over to a motor you're
going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> feed<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:44.939> motor<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
going to feed your motor so with the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.030 
going to feed your motor so with the
added<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.689> bigger<00:01:48.930> pickups<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.829> bigger

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
added the bigger pickups the bigger

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.080 
added the bigger pickups the bigger
lines<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.659> splits<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:53.520> should<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
lines and then it splits it should get a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.749 
lines and then it splits it should get a
little<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.479> volume<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.829> speed<00:01:56.250> control

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
little more volume to your speed control

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.370 
little more volume to your speed control
and<00:01:58.759> what<00:01:59.759> hopefully<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> fix<00:02:01.170> my

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
and what hopefully is going to fix my

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.880 
and what hopefully is going to fix my
problem<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.640> fresh<00:02:03.240> cold<00:02:03.840> water<00:02:04.200> that's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
problem is the fresh cold water that's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.419 
problem is the fresh cold water that's
going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.219> go<00:02:05.369> directly<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> motor<00:02:07.399> what<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
going to go directly to the motor what I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.780 
going to go directly to the motor what I
had<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.619> drill<00:02:10.619> another<00:02:10.920> hole<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
had to do is drill another hole in the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.309 
had to do is drill another hole in the
side<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.060> my<00:02:12.180> hull

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
side of my hull

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.119 
side of my hull
just<00:02:13.530> ordered<00:02:13.890> some<00:02:14.340> pieces<00:02:14.969> from<00:02:15.359> traxxas<00:02:16.129> to

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
just ordered some pieces from traxxas to

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.629 
just ordered some pieces from traxxas to
make<00:02:17.609> some<00:02:17.819> finishing<00:02:18.120> touches<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:19.909> that<00:02:21.590> and

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:22.639 
make some finishing touches so that and

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.979 
make some finishing touches so that and
this<00:02:23.639> are<00:02:23.879> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> look<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.269> same<00:02:24.629> thing

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
this are going to look the same thing

this are going to look the same thing
this<00:02:25.469> is<00:02:25.620> kind<00:02:25.859> of<00:02:25.950> ugly<00:02:26.129> but<00:02:26.549> for<00:02:26.879> right<00:02:27.030> now

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
this is kind of ugly but for right now

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.559 
this is kind of ugly but for right now
I'm<00:02:27.329> just<00:02:27.359> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.689> trim<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.019> down<00:02:28.079> and<00:02:29.569> it'll

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
I'm just going to trim it down and it'll

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.589 
I'm just going to trim it down and it'll
do<00:02:30.840> its<00:02:31.019> thing<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.670> we'll<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.239> how<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.420> goes

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
do its thing so we'll see how that goes
