00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:11.849
 driver is required my task is to introduce 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 you no less as shown 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.220
 practice back to the beginning of the series 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.050
 no force it do not stand on the ring 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
 trails in relatively calm 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.789
 the atmosphere is all rolled up enough 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 still in the early stages of nfs development and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.449
 come back to this after 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 unsurpassed bridge wanted cheese 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.450
 gorgeous chase with dozens 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 police cars have no desire 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 realizing this after a dull prostreet 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.930
 developers from io and black box come from 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 for the next driving season in the best 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.219
 traditions of the tenth 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.520
 Undercover through the mouth of developers promised 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.840
 impress us with an exciting plot 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.629
 dynamic gameplay and of course 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.270
 spectacular scenes of persecution and we 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.610
 it was already believed that one more would descend 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.190
 revelation would be most welcome 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.949
 at least after carbon and pro street but 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.680
 Alas, miracle did not happen undercover without 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.540
 exaggeration the clearest symbolizes that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 a series of exhausted developers 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.850
 finally hit the copy 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 they copy to the word very, very so 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.020
 yourself in the role of riders forced under 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.509
 cover collect for police 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 information we infiltrate into the sphere of dashing 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.979
 street racing got rooted there 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.650
 win respect and make your way to the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.110
 riding after which all surrender giblets 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.409
 what did we know the seed long before 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.900
 release picture is generally dismal 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.030
 conveyor production of games cannot but 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.369
 fail with the amount of work 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 growing swing is also good and during 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.960
 make everything becomes practically 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.189
 impossible this time of year to develop 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.189
 obviously not enough 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.439
 undercover cheese like fresh fish town 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.630
 empty without leagues and monotonous graphics 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.270
 creepy keeps only good 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.460
 car models the engine is not optimized and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 not trained in multi-core interaction 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 Komi and the speed of his work is far from 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.600
 local car speeds due to 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.950
 than periodically have to watch 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 textures loaded on the go and even 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.569
 level geometry game pauses 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.690
 no extra comments and we look like 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.030
 highway houses appear on the way 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.490
 and other cars does it say that 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 to the special effects hardly touched the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.240
 have us budge like everyone else 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.760
 around it is forgotten by blur that should 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.070
 symbolize the speed of the collision 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.590
 and other related elements 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.420
 made generally somehow and in no way 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.310
 comparison does not go with physical 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.310
 special effects nedforspid bridge 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.330
 I 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.590
 of course to create the main menu 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.020
 there is no time left but because she 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
 in undercover is missing completely us 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.830
 without warning throwing out on the street 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.450
 and in the future do not leave options 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.460
 except how to conduct your business not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.260
 walking away from the ticket office for lazy only 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.030
 have provided the opportunity by pressing 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.890
 tab keys immediately be in place 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.230
 the next event whether it's a race 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.840
 competition to the detriment of the state or 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.730
 plot episode with racing no problem 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.560
 none because of incurable stupidity 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.140
 computer drivers win all 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.150
 arrivals not difficult much more difficult 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.680
 score points damage uncle sam and would 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.420
 interactivity of the environment here 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.640
 as minimal as it is 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.260
 generally possible except standard 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.450
 undercover cop traps 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.910
 provided with half a dozen more objects 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.170
 who are allowed to kick and search for those 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.300
 takes most of the time 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.240
 allotted to collecting points in this mode 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.280
 yes yes now it 's also on time plot 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.500
 same events are the same races in 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.360
 different modes coming with 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.820
 artistic value video 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.410
 the last dangerous nearing zero and early 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.570
 or later anyway forces 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.370
 merciless about skip ivan iv due 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.860
 the fact that besides chatter there actually 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.810
 nothing but gameplay that should like 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.450
 how to complement these inserts with dynamics 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.460
 its task can not cope of course 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.440
 there is a tuning which you forget 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.540
 after the first two or three visits to the garage 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 useless damage model in any way and 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.040
 not influencing anything strange 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.410
 leadership premiums suddenly improving 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.120
 abstract characteristics of the hero in general 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.220
 a whole carriage of the usual and not very 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.970
 aspects each of which is implemented in 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.410
 times worse than in previous parts 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.200
 you can always invent something new 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.060
 there would be enough imagination and desire if everything 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.790
 exhausted sew elements of fiction 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.710
 and like anyone else especially not damaged but 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.930
 every year to give the game worse 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.540
 the previous is a sure way to kill not 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.820
 only all perspectives of the series but also good 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.950
 the name of many successful episodes in fps of 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.660
 past on bezrybe course on 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.670
 the undercover could be reversed 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.500
 more attention but this year 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.620
 fans of auto simulators large 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.090
 lucky came out race driver grid 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.090
 recommend not to be distracted from him
