showing<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.360> how<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.599> turn<00:00:10.070> one<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.190> these

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
showing you how to turn one of these

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.200 
showing you how to turn one of these
which<00:00:12.269> turns<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.500> switch<00:00:14.160> which<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.759> led<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
which turns in switch which is led by a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.300 
which turns in switch which is led by a
line<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.109> redstone<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.560> power<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.859> redstone

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
line of redstone to power a redstone

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.410 
line of redstone to power a redstone
lamp<00:00:17.670> into<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.690> button<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:20.060> does<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> same

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
lamp into a button that does the same

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.200 
lamp into a button that does the same
thing<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.930> when<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.010> push<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> button<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
thing as this when you push a button it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.410 
thing as this when you push a button it
turns<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.930> then<00:00:25.019> off<00:00:25.670> when<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.880> flick

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
turns it on and then off when you flick

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.620 
turns it on and then off when you flick
a<00:00:27.449> switch<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:28.349> keeps<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.220> off<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.760> know<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
a switch it keeps it on or off I know a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
a switch it keeps it on or off I know a
way<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.900> make<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.070> use<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> button

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
way to make it so when you use a button

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.069 
way to make it so when you use a button
it<00:00:32.969> will<00:00:33.120> either<00:00:33.300> stay<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.840> or<00:00:34.230> stay<00:00:35.130> off<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
it will either stay on or stay off a

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.119 
it will either stay on or stay off a
button<00:00:37.079> does<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> switches<00:00:38.070> job<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:40.010> here's<00:00:41.010> how

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
button does a switches job so here's how

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.600 
button does a switches job so here's how
you<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.760> very<00:00:42.180> very<00:00:42.480> very<00:00:42.960> simple

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
you make it it's very very very simple

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
you make it it's very very very simple
you<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:44.969> redstone<00:00:46.219> lamp<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.760> whatever

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you get your redstone lamp or whatever

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.500 
you get your redstone lamp or whatever
and<00:00:48.829> then<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> line<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> redstone<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and then you get a line of redstone and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.420 
and then you get a line of redstone and
instead<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:53.539> powering<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.260> have

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
instead of powering it with all you have

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.950 
instead of powering it with all you have
switch<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.180> any<00:00:57.360> switches<00:00:57.629> but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
switch you don't have any switches but

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.750 
switch you don't have any switches but
you<00:00:58.109> want<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.530> switch<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you want a switch all you have is a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.969 
you want a switch all you have is a
button<00:01:00.079> here's<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:03.270> make<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
button here's what you do you make this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.289 
button here's what you do you make this
Tetris<00:01:04.979> looking<00:01:05.489> shape<00:01:06.650> like<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:09.060> place

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Tetris looking shape like this you place

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.030 
Tetris looking shape like this you place
a<00:01:09.450> redstone<00:01:09.570> torch<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> wall<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.860> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a redstone torch on the wall of that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
a redstone torch on the wall of that
block<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> ground<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.930> block

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
block and on the ground of that block

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.660 
block and on the ground of that block
and<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.960> redstone<00:01:16.380> dust<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> read<00:01:17.490> some

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and a redstone dust here and I read some

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.590 
and a redstone dust here and I read some
dust<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.150> repeater<00:01:21.150> set<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so if I get are not Jaden for button I'm

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.330 
so if I get are not Jaden for button I'm
Johnny's<00:01:40.860> friend<00:01:41.390> youtube<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.930> Jaden

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
anyway um so now the button does the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.920 
anyway um so now the button does the
same<00:01:48.840> job<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> switch<00:01:49.500> oh<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.810> there<00:01:54.810> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
same job as a switch oh so there you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.719 
same job as a switch oh so there you
have<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.860> turn<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:57.619> switch

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
have it that's how you turn a switch

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
have it that's how you turn a switch
into<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> button<00:02:00.229> making<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.740> switch<00:02:01.950> I
