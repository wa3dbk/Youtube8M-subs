00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.379
 but obviously we'll start with the 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.629
 construction of the isometric cube as 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.160
 we should have seen we have to have 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.200
 our margin of one centimeter in each 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.150
 line after this we will mark what 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.710
 are centimeters two centimeters or 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.640
 desired centimeters to be able to obtain 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.640
 our support lines 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.750
 but obviously we take what is a 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.060
 squad whichever is not necessary 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.340
 distinguish which one and plot what is 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.340
 our top line of support 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.560
 then we can draw the bottom line 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.560
 support line 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.730
 once obtained we grab what is the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.470
 45 degree square positioning the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.020
 on one of the support lines 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.800
 to be able to place the squadron later 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.350
 of 30 degrees 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 using this same angle to be able 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.940
 trace what is a random line to 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.490
 to get one of the axes of 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.100
 what is the cube like that also getting 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.350
 those on the same side taking into account the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.350
 point where they collide what are the lines 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.440
 in the same way we can make what 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.540
 are 6 centimeters of each line or of the 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.750
 centimeters wanted to the cube that we go 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.750
 To make 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.050
 once obtained the six centimeters 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.740
 we erase what are the lines that we 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.740
 they are left over 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.010
 we put back the square of 45 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.010
 as our our support 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.459
 then we take the squadron of 30 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.230
 degrees positioning the in what they are 90 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.870
 degrees to draw a line 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.640
 vertical 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.080
 we can also do it in the next 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:29.150
 another point would be our focal point 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.150
 and in our side point 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.519
 once obtained we mark what they are 6 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.849
 centimeters in each of the lines 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.849
 vertical 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.260
 to correspond to the next thing that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.569
 would be to place our squadron of 30 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.360
 degrees on the support squad that is 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.040
 the one of 45 taking into account the point and has 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.380
 given the 6 centimeters for 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.380
 intercept with the other line 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.350
 so we will get what is one of the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.340
 cube faces or one of your views like 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.340
 they want to mention it 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.910
 in the same way we did the other 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.490
 side to get the second side 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.550
 so we do it from the point where 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.430
 intersect the lines to be able 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.390
 get what is one of the one of the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.390
 upper axes 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.840
 in the same way we do it from the side 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.840
 contrary 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.000
 so we will get what is our cube 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:53.879
 but you have to delete the lines and also 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.829
 we still need a few steps 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.040
 so that the cube is correctly ' 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.040
 all right 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.300
 we must take into account that these 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.190
 lines are walnut lines so you do not 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.380
 confuse at the moment if they emphasize it 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.030
 much or any other situation 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.190
 we will take what is the squadron of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.020
 any other squad does not matter the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.990
 angle to be able to mark those that are 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.880
 reference lines would be the view 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.400
 back or the view that we do not 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.560
 we can visualize that only 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.300
 they are lines as if it were a support for 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.810
 can see that the cube is fine to the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.810
 perfection 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.740
 as you can see our cube is 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.040
 sees perfectly well no longer looks like 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.040
 before 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.550
 now we can grab our pencil hb and 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.950
 highlight what the cube is for 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.129
 a better view with a better way of 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.349
 see him 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.529
 with impressive quality you can 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.529
 watch 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.379
 we mark our lines that we could 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.949
 call the support or lines that do not 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:26.150
 could see how to visualize that the 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.340
 cube is in a way 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:33.530
 corresponding in which we can 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.530
 visualize it in that correct way 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.900
 erasing in a bird the points that are 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.669
 left over so the cube can have its 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.659
 better way with this we have our 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.659
 isometric cube
