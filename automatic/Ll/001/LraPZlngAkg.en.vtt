00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.320
 everyone was ico little video 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.269
 to present you two glitch on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.160
 very nice minecraft I want to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.990
 so specify you have you could have 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 see at the beginning of the video so the intro 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 geek aqsfr so she will be sent 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.490
 sent to this channel then the first 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 glitch is to corner a blog a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 forgiveness chest in a block to make click 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.929
 right and we can see that it opens us 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.170
 the wa gonnet and we can lay blocks 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 of teeth or items what we want 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.520
 so obviously it's camouflaging 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.960
 you can see it here 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.280
 so to realize them nothing more 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 simple a block a rail at the top the mind 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 storage card placed on the rail 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.309
 break the block so that the mike hart 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.910
 fall to the ground you do a tower of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.710
 three cubes next you see the block 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.640
 here on which one does he right you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.170
 go the m right above the myocardium 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.439
 so we'll put we'll get closer 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 without too much sticking to the mind map for 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.189
 avoid pushing it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.640
 we put the piston with a torch 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.000
 on top to light it up we take off on 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 break all that and there we can see that he 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.430
 is there a side where the same card is not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.210
 apparent angot moves everywhere 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.110
 and here's the ubs apologized to me so 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.540
 so here I am to subscribers we put this 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.950
 we want in the pop up 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 here is very discreet here 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 if someone does not get close to that in a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.399
 sorry wall we will not have fun 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.579
 to make clips everywhere to open 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.740
 this second glitch consists of 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.689
 come out of a cave in very multiplayer 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.159
 easily 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.990
 so imagine that you are here 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.380
 in your cave you go digging 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.039
 three cubes put you under this so 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.170
 under this vacuum 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.000
 you're going to block here so yes we 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.329
 can jump out but it's not the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.100
 goal 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.469
 you put a gravel on top of 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.019
 your head you replace the sword 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.910
 the gravel here beyond by a block of which 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.980
 we are really totally stuck in 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.130
 what in this gravel have as soon as they get me 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.410

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.420
 immediately show you that it is 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.400
 very real 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.709

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.480
