now I can't talk about player eggs is

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.440 
now I can't talk about player eggs is
usually<00:03:30.630> when<00:03:31.530> he's<00:03:32.370> trying<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.820> sign<00:03:33.060> them<00:03:33.300> or

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
usually when he's trying to sign them or

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.840 
usually when he's trying to sign them or

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
get a message to them that he wants them

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.880 
get a message to them that he wants them
or<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.690> this<00:03:36.840> case<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.350> not<00:03:37.470> necessary

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
or in this case it's not necessary

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.280 
or in this case it's not necessary
because<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.100> player<00:03:38.400> already<00:03:38.670> knows<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.480> can

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
because the player already knows I can

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.610 
because the player already knows I can
think<00:03:40.470> about<00:03:41.570> one<00:03:42.570> example<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:42.960> this<00:03:43.020> was<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
think about one example of this was the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.540 
think about one example of this was the
Rickie<00:03:44.160> Lambert<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.640> think<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.970> was<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.860> I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
Rickie Lambert I think it was and I

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.880 
Rickie Lambert I think it was and I
can't<00:03:47.820> think<00:03:48.030> who<00:03:48.270> else<00:03:48.540> be<00:03:49.020> prior<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.440> him

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
can't think who else be prior to him

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.590 
can't think who else be prior to him
there<00:03:50.040> was<00:03:50.130> another<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.460> praia<00:03:50.730> team<00:03:50.940> closer

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
there was another one praia team closer

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.700 
there was another one praia team closer
then<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:54.540> can't<00:03:55.050> go<00:03:55.200> back<00:03:55.410> through<00:03:55.620> almost

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
then I I can't go back through almost

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.320 
then I I can't go back through almost
press<00:03:56.040> conferences<00:03:56.550> but<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.760> know<00:03:56.880> for<00:03:57.240> a<00:03:57.270> fact

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
press conferences but I know for a fact

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.870 
press conferences but I know for a fact
that<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.590> what<00:03:58.920> Brendan<00:03:59.280> Rodgers<00:03:59.640> does

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
that this is what Brendan Rodgers does

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.930 
that this is what Brendan Rodgers does
okay<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.290> can't<00:04:01.980> confirm<00:04:02.190> either<00:04:02.610> wear

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
okay so I can't confirm either wear

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.000 
okay so I can't confirm either wear
bright<00:04:03.420> so<00:04:03.690> like<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:04.080> he<00:04:04.200> was<00:04:04.230> normally<00:04:04.830> would

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
bright so like if he was normally would

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.400 
bright so like if he was normally would
say<00:04:05.220> i'm<00:04:06.060> not<00:04:06.480> talking<00:04:06.840> about<00:04:06.900> transfer

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
say i'm not talking about transfer

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.350 
say i'm not talking about transfer
speculation<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.250> stops<00:04:08.520> at<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.910> yeah

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
speculation and it stops at that yeah

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.180 
speculation and it stops at that yeah
but<00:04:10.020> he<00:04:10.080> says<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.260> can't<00:04:10.350> confirm<00:04:10.800> either<00:04:11.010> way

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
but he says I can't confirm either way

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.650 
but he says I can't confirm either way
you<00:04:11.370> know<00:04:11.490> mean<00:04:11.670> terms<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.120> speculation<00:04:12.600> of

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
you know mean terms of speculation of

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.960 
you know mean terms of speculation of
players<00:04:12.900> right<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.530> that's<00:04:13.680> right<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.190> then

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
players right so that's right and then
