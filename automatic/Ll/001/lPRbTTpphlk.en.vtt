and then take them up so there's that so
I<00:00:26.550> believe<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.330> palette<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> roughly<00:00:28.650> around

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
I believe this palette is roughly around

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.519 
I believe this palette is roughly around
ten<00:00:29.670> dollars<00:00:30.119> 1012<00:00:30.779> doll<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.109> something<00:00:31.260> like

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
ten dollars 1012 doll or something like

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
ten dollars 1012 doll or something like
that<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.820> three<00:00:33.149> four<00:00:33.390> five

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that and you get one two three four five

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.420 
that and you get one two three four five
six<00:00:33.719> twelve<00:00:34.320> shades<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> mixture<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.180> um

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
six twelve shades it's a mixture of um

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.270 
six twelve shades it's a mixture of um
math<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.020> shimmers<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:41.040> there

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
math and shimmers as you can see there

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.090 
math and shimmers as you can see there
I've<00:00:41.579> probably<00:00:42.000> used<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:43.410> two<00:00:43.710> three<00:00:43.920> four

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
I've probably used one two three four

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.529 
I've probably used one two three four
five<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.760> least<00:00:44.940> half<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:47.539> just

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
five like at least half of them and just

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
five like at least half of them and just
because<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:48.989> colors<00:00:49.289> i<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:50.039> i

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because the other colors i don't think i

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.389 
because the other colors i don't think i
would<00:00:50.190> necessarily<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:51.420> use<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.399> um

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
would necessarily actually use so um

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.270 
would necessarily actually use so um
best<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.860> fresh

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
best to just have this now as it's fresh

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.110 
best to just have this now as it's fresh
do<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.840> um<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.250> bad<00:00:59.879> at

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
all I think these two colors are worth

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.700 
all I think these two colors are worth

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
not the palette for you unless you just

that<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.860> color<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> even<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.390> not

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that one color and even then it's not

that one color and even then it's not
really<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.229> crazy<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> would<00:01:47.009> say<00:01:47.130> it's

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
really really crazy but I would say it's

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
really really crazy but I would say it's
probably<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.820> most<00:01:48.000> pigmented<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.960> this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
probably the most pigmented out of this
palette<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.280> those<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.790> who<00:01:51.090> like

washes<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.250> color<00:02:22.410> if<00:02:23.410> you're<00:02:23.590> looking<00:02:23.800> for

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
washes of color if you're looking for

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.150 
washes of color if you're looking for
something<00:02:25.150> where<00:02:25.870> it's<00:02:25.989> really<00:02:26.440> heavy<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
something where it's really heavy and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.190 
something where it's really heavy and
dramatic<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.360> not<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.630> palette<00:02:28.959> for<00:02:29.080> you

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200

but for everyday use I think it actually

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.960 
but for everyday use I think it actually
is<00:02:31.930> for<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.770> price<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.520> all<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.880> these

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
is for that price to get all of these

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.120

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260

super fluffy blending brush rather than

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.660 
super fluffy blending brush rather than
a<00:03:43.480> laydown<00:03:43.930> brush<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.890> can<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.400> do

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
a laydown brush so then you can just do

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.920 
a laydown brush so then you can just do
a<00:03:45.700> nice<00:03:46.450> wash<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.840> color<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.370> would<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.239> say<00:03:49.630> that

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
a nice wash of color so would I say that

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.009 
a nice wash of color so would I say that
these<00:03:50.500> are<00:03:50.829> like<00:03:51.010> dupes<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.609> NARS<00:03:52.000> or<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.810> is

anything like if I going to yoga and

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.540 
anything like if I going to yoga and
because<00:06:05.110> I<00:06:05.139> really<00:06:05.560> don't<00:06:05.740> have<00:06:05.950> a<00:06:05.979> brow<00:06:06.280> I'm

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
because I really don't have a brow I'm

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.550 
because I really don't have a brow I'm
we'll<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:07.000> whip<00:06:07.270> that<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:07.780> just<00:06:07.930> swipe<00:06:08.320> that

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
we'll just whip that and just swipe that

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.010 
we'll just whip that and just swipe that
through<00:06:08.950> maybe<00:06:09.280> twice<00:06:09.760> and<00:06:10.150> it<00:06:10.660> just<00:06:10.870> gives

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
through maybe twice and it just gives

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.629 
through maybe twice and it just gives
that<00:06:11.169> hint<00:06:11.560> of<00:06:11.650> definition<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.430> that's

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
that hint of definition and that's

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.460 
that hint of definition and that's
enough<00:06:12.970> and<00:06:13.210> so<00:06:13.360> I<00:06:13.389> think<00:06:13.660> really<00:06:14.110> for<00:06:14.350> less

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
enough and so I think really for less

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.020 
enough and so I think really for less
than<00:06:14.650> 10<00:06:14.860> bucks<00:06:15.100> when<00:06:15.340> the<00:06:15.430> other<00:06:15.550> things<00:06:15.850> are

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
than 10 bucks when the other things are

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.120 
than 10 bucks when the other things are
like<00:06:16.180> closer<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.570> 30<00:06:16.990> it<00:06:17.229> totally<00:06:17.919> is

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
like closer to 30 it totally is

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.090 
like closer to 30 it totally is
comparable<00:06:18.690> the<00:06:19.690> formulation<00:06:20.440> as<00:06:20.710> you<00:06:20.950> can

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
comparable the formulation as you can

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.040 
comparable the formulation as you can
see<00:06:21.310> it's<00:06:21.520> more<00:06:21.729> on<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.060> ashy<00:06:22.240> cool<00:06:22.810> tone

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
see it's more on the ashy cool tone

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.719 
see it's more on the ashy cool tone
which<00:06:23.289> is<00:06:23.410> what<00:06:23.560> I<00:06:23.590> want<00:06:23.889> I<00:06:24.070> don't<00:06:24.130> want<00:06:24.370> like<00:06:24.700> a

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
which is what I want I don't want like a

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.020 
which is what I want I don't want like a
ready<00:06:25.090> brown<00:06:25.450> brow<00:06:26.350> at<00:06:26.620> all<00:06:26.770> so<00:06:27.430> I<00:06:27.460> think<00:06:27.729> that

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
ready brown brow at all so I think that

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.170 
ready brown brow at all so I think that
both<00:06:28.539> of<00:06:28.570> these<00:06:28.960> are<00:06:29.620> actually<00:06:30.280> a<00:06:30.490> really<00:06:31.060> good

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
both of these are actually a really good

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.300 
both of these are actually a really good
value<00:06:31.690> for<00:06:31.930> money<00:06:32.140> and

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
value for money and

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.190 
value for money and
and<00:06:33.400> don't<00:06:34.060> be<00:06:34.210> expecting<00:06:34.510> crazy

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
and don't be expecting crazy

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.780 
and don't be expecting crazy
pigmentation<00:06:35.980> with<00:06:36.100> that<00:06:36.250> you<00:06:36.430> will<00:06:36.610> be

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
pigmentation with that you will be

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.520 
pigmentation with that you will be
disappointed<00:06:36.970> but<00:06:37.570> if<00:06:37.750> you're<00:06:37.960> sort<00:06:38.290> of<00:06:38.350> like

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
disappointed but if you're sort of like

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.040 
disappointed but if you're sort of like
an<00:06:38.680> everyday<00:06:39.010> natural<00:06:39.730> makeup<00:06:39.970> where<00:06:40.360> you

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
an everyday natural makeup where you

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.090 
an everyday natural makeup where you
don't<00:06:41.230> you<00:06:41.500> know<00:06:41.620> you're<00:06:41.740> certainly<00:06:42.040> not

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
don't you know you're certainly not

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.830 
don't you know you're certainly not
wearing<00:06:42.490> as<00:06:42.610> much<00:06:42.760> makeup<00:06:42.970> as<00:06:43.180> I<00:06:43.330> am<00:06:43.450> now<00:06:43.630> in

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
wearing as much makeup as I am now in

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.390 
wearing as much makeup as I am now in
terms<00:06:43.990> of<00:06:44.110> with<00:06:44.260> all<00:06:44.410> the<00:06:44.530> liner<00:06:44.770> and<00:06:44.980> sort<00:06:45.340> of

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
terms of with all the liner and sort of

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.100 
terms of with all the liner and sort of
the<00:06:45.460> shadow<00:06:45.730> I<00:06:45.970> think<00:06:46.720> that<00:06:46.750> would<00:06:46.960> be<00:06:47.020> really

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
the shadow I think that would be really

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.110 
the shadow I think that would be really
good<00:06:47.440> for<00:06:47.500> you<00:06:47.770> and<00:06:47.920> I<00:06:47.980> think<00:06:48.010> anybody<00:06:48.760> who

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
good for you and I think anybody who

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.320 
good for you and I think anybody who
uses<00:06:49.450> a<00:06:49.750> brow<00:06:50.050> product<00:06:50.620> um<00:06:51.180> that's<00:06:52.180> not<00:06:52.240> a

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
uses a brow product um that's not a

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.360 
uses a brow product um that's not a
pencil<00:06:52.750> that's<00:06:52.960> more<00:06:53.170> of<00:06:53.350> just<00:06:53.560> sort<00:06:53.860> of<00:06:53.950> a

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
pencil that's more of just sort of a

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.630 
pencil that's more of just sort of a
wash<00:06:54.850> of<00:06:55.060> color<00:06:55.330> through<00:06:55.900> then<00:06:56.620> I<00:06:56.650> think<00:06:57.040> high

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
wash of color through then I think high

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.430 
wash of color through then I think high
and<00:06:58.150> low<00:06:58.390> end<00:06:58.600> it<00:06:58.750> doesn't<00:06:59.020> matter<00:06:59.050> I<00:06:59.230> think

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
and low end it doesn't matter I think

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.200 
and low end it doesn't matter I think
you'll<00:06:59.590> all<00:06:59.740> really<00:07:00.340> really<00:07:00.370> dig<00:07:00.760> this<00:07:00.940> so
