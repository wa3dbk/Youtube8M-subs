 apparently it's a place 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.950
 and against visitors who are

 to find some very faithful decorations 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.280
 the television series then the people 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.180

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.780
 the hospital from the beginning where is the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.430
 door not open 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.800
 dead I have for nothing 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 they will recognize all many of the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.580
 best decorations 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.060
 and what do you think that differentiates the passage 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 bakker ned experience the rest of the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.950
 passage what differentiates walking 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.520
 dead 'experience of a passage of terror 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.230
 to use is that you are not traveling 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 rooms and different creatures come out 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.090
 kittens 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.670
 a wire 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.350
 a site and you have to try to get there 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.850
 until the end you will find 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 human characters that interact 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.969
 with you who ask for things touches you 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.799
 they wrap a little in the story is not 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.659
 the same operation there are people who 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.119
 believe that this is what the old man was 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.610
 big house that you give you legal scare if you do not 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.850
 what we are looking for here we have colors that 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.609
 they evoke forest burned flesh to a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 hospital we have different types 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.380
 of effects on the just or missing by 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.720
 course but it's more in going back to the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.840
 people in an experience giving them a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.110
 mission motive and guidelines how 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.110
 arrive 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.650
 these are some of the masks that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 we use for the show that are 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.590
 replicas of walkers that come out in the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.900
 series there are some actors that go 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.910
 that they are made up and there are others that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.740
 they use these masks what is the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.200
 reason for these masks because we want 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.580
 make the experience as good as possible 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.410
 then for the walkers to be 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.660
 same as those seen in the show 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.300
 television under the guidelines 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.730
 We have been modeling the faces of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.290
 the fingers 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.209
 of the walkers more more 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.120
 representative and this is a sample of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.590
 a thing of what comes 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 so you are going to find 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.990
 this is one of the corridors we have 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.220
 in the tour if you are so brave 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.220
 I stayed until the end 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.069
 now let's take them to a place 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.460
 safe 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.760
 people 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.930
 the prelate does it very strangely 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.930
 so I do not you 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.659
 plus 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.650
 Y 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.650
