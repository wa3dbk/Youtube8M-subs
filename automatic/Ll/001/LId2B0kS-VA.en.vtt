00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.490
 in this video we will calculate the integral 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.860
 of arc tangent of x match a number 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.430
 which is the square of x we ​​have in the 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.059
 denominator 1 + something squared we can 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.850
 think that the formula to use that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.900
 is here dt one more match 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 t squared equal tangent arc of t 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.470
 plus 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.580
 in our case this is at 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:38.130
 square in the denominator one plus one 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.130
 more we have below and it would be you x 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.540
 is x 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.620
 dt the crater x that is one of x where 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.620
 tx this tea 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.820
 and this would be equal to up to the arc 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.820
 tangent of x 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:06.830
 down 1 plus x squared 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:08.990
 plus x that is squared by x3 cc as 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.240
 we have put here 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.759
 but to apply the formula they have to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.610
 disappear the Xs here we have 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.770
 up a tangent arc of X that 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.600
 take it out we can not because it depends 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 of x you can only get the numbers 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.310
 loose crazy tangent that can not be 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.930
 take out and this stays like this is not 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.990
 You can remove the X from inside the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.979
 integral therefore it seems that that does not 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.979
 is the right formula 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.630
 which can then be the formula 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.380
 with observe that arc tangent of what 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.380
 is this from here 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.880
 its derivative is 1 match one plus x 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.500
 square this we have here a one 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.510
 that you can always put on during the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.890
 numerator and called one plus x when 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.540
 I know the arc tangent that your 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.850
 delicate work 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.000
 as you can think of this formula of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.000
 here 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.950
 Of course there is no power there but 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.950
 as we know 5 the same as 5 watering 1 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.750
 then we could try 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.020
 stark otan betis people seeing it as 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.410
 tangent of x raised to 1 with what 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.410
 we would have 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.550
 we will call 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.320
 it's against people that it's what 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.770
 this case 1 is elevated the derivative of 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.310
 t the drift of otan people x create 1 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.020
 match one plus x to the square of x 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.700
 remember in the derivative of what 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.200
 inside party one more what from within 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:03:00.660
 square and we clear tx of x would be 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.660
 equal to 1 plus x squared 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.500
 then this would be equal to the integral 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.010
 of alcóntar people of x that this elevated 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.900
 One plus one party stays squared 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.599
 what is elevated to one 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.970
 if we want we do not put anything and of x then 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.440
 one plus x squared 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.530
 dt 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.310
 this is simplified with this we have t 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.150
 raised to perfect ones in x we ​​apply 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:38.520
 the formula raised to 11 match one 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.070
 more one more would be primed donner that is 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.070
 They have square match 2 more 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.380
 we already have written this test arc 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.250
 tangent of x we replace them arc 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.630
 tangent 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.540
 that 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.540
 squared match 2 more 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.709
 another way of expressing it is this 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.260
 square to avoid the parenthesis 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.990
 well put it there is the same arc 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.970
 tangent 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:13.720
 square of x matches more 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.790
 c varying in r this is the result of 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.790
 the integral
