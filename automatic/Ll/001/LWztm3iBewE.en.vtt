00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
involve laughs well the reason that it
hasn't<00:00:35.280> happened<00:00:35.610> yet<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
hasn't happened yet is because the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
hasn't happened yet is because the
licensing<00:00:37.739> rights<00:00:37.950> alone<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.000> figure<00:00:39.329> line

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
licensing rights alone on a figure line

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540 
licensing rights alone on a figure line
like<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.520> really<00:00:41.520> really

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
like that would be really really

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.799 
like that would be really really
expensive

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
expensive

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.910 
expensive
I<00:00:42.870> guess<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:45.239> order<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> right

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
I guess the in order to have the right

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
I guess the in order to have the right
to<00:00:47.129> produce<00:00:47.489> Zelda<00:00:48.360> figures<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.870> somewhere

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
can also be a really tough process but
