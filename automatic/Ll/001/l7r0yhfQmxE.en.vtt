surprising<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.080> didn't<00:01:22.560> even<00:01:22.619> realize<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
surprising I didn't even realize it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
surprising I didn't even realize it
could<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> push<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
could do that you kind of got to push it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
could do that you kind of got to push it
in<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> grips<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> hold<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
in but the grips kind of hold it in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
in but the grips kind of hold it in
there<00:01:27.060> very<00:01:27.210> securely<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> mean<00:01:28.470> that's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
there very securely so I mean that's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.350 
there very securely so I mean that's
very<00:01:29.250> awesome<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.030> put<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.240> in

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
horizontally of course you could you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.130 
horizontally of course you could you
really<00:01:32.909> kind<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.630> careful<00:01:33.810> with

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
really kind of got to be careful with

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
really kind of got to be careful with
the<00:01:34.229> size<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> gets<00:01:34.979> any<00:01:35.100> bigger<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.790> don't

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.160 
the size if it gets any bigger I don't
know<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.630> fit<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> there

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.370 
know if it's going to fit in there
horizontally<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.070> but<00:01:38.850> anyways<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.200> put

the sides in here and when I push the
sides<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> basically<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.509> will<00:01:45.689> secure<00:01:46.649> my

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
sides and basically it will secure my

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.039 
sides and basically it will secure my
device<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.549> here<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.090> you'll<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
device right here so you'll see it's

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.590 
device right here so you'll see it's
very<00:01:49.320> hard<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> pull<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.939> would<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> very

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
very hard to pull out it would be very

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
very hard to pull out it would be very
hard<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.960> drop<00:01:52.350> see<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.649> shaking<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.399> not

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
hard to drop see I'm shaking in it's not

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.420 
hard to drop see I'm shaking in it's not
even<00:01:53.759> coming<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.840> mean<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.619> don't

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
even coming out I mean you really don't

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.980 
even coming out I mean you really don't
have<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> worry<00:01:57.299> about<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.659> coming<00:01:57.840> out

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
have to worry about it coming out

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.209 
have to worry about it coming out
especially<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> bump<00:01:59.009> or

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
especially if you go over a bump or

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.969 
especially if you go over a bump or
anything<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> car<00:01:59.939> no<00:02:00.930> worries<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
anything in the car no worries there so

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
anything in the car no worries there so
and<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.880> course<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.329> press<00:02:03.540> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and of course you have to press this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.359 
and of course you have to press this
button<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> make<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.409> expand<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> can't

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
button to make it expand so you can't

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
button to make it expand so you can't
pull<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.640> apart<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> worry

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
pull it apart so you don't have to worry

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.020 
pull it apart so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.409> either<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.429> works<00:02:08.640> very<00:02:08.910> well

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
about that either so it works very well

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.760 
about that either so it works very well
to<00:02:09.239> keep<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.629> thumb<00:02:09.840> secure<00:02:10.319> especially

to keep your thumb secure especially

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.660 
to keep your thumb secure especially
when<00:02:10.920> driving

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
when driving

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
when driving
you<00:02:12.180> basically<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.930> different

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
you basically you have different

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
you basically you have different
customizations<00:02:14.190> you'll<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.880> can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
customizations you'll see here you can

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.180 
customizations you'll see here you can
you<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.480> turn<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.959> basically<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:17.040> can

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
you can turn this basically you can

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.699 
you can turn this basically you can
twist<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.640> right<00:02:17.880> here<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.270> unlock

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
twist this right here to unlock

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.050 
twist this right here to unlock
unlocking<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.830> makes<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.160> really<00:02:20.459> easy<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
unlocking it makes it really easy to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.030 
unlocking it makes it really easy to
turn<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.720> rotate<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.260> your<00:02:22.380> liking<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.890> then

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
turn and rotate to your liking and then

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800 
turn and rotate to your liking and then
basically<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.459> Twitter<00:02:23.760> ight<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.630> kind

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
basically you Twitter ight and it kind

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.479 
basically you Twitter ight and it kind
of<00:02:24.840> locks<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.190> it's

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
of locks it in there for you so it's

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.510 
of locks it in there for you so it's
more<00:02:26.940> difficult<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.569> turn<00:02:27.930> your<00:02:28.709> device<00:02:28.830> with

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
more difficult to turn your device with

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.030 
more difficult to turn your device with
this<00:02:29.760> basically<00:02:30.690> it's<00:02:31.020> very<00:02:31.350> difficult<00:02:31.650> but

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
this basically it's very difficult but

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.550 
this basically it's very difficult but
you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.340> still<00:02:32.640> make<00:02:33.300> turn<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> I'm<00:02:34.319> not<00:02:34.500> sure

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
you can still make turn it I'm not sure

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.470 
you can still make turn it I'm not sure
what<00:02:34.830> material<00:02:35.310> material<00:02:35.940> that's<00:02:36.090> made<00:02:36.300> of

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
what material material that's made of

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.410 
what material material that's made of
but<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.200> very<00:02:37.380> sturdy<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.069> strong<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.519> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
but it's very sturdy and strong and it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.660 
but it's very sturdy and strong and it's
difficult<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.620> basically<00:02:40.920> bend<00:02:41.280> but<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
difficult to to basically bend but you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.190 
difficult to to basically bend but you
can<00:02:41.819> definitely<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.630> makes<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.900> stay

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
can definitely do it so it makes it stay

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.900 
can definitely do it so it makes it stay
still<00:02:43.530> since<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.160> difficult<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.640> bend

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
still since it's so difficult to bend

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.729 
still since it's so difficult to bend
which<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.600> great<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.350> obviously

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
which is great because you can obviously

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.350 
which is great because you can obviously
customize<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.550> how<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.790> want<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.120> whether

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
customize it to how you want it whether

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.180 
customize it to how you want it whether
you<00:02:48.540> want<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> bend<00:02:48.989> straight<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:50.010> do

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
you want it to bend straight up or do

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.800 
you want it to bend straight up or do
you<00:02:50.250> want<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.580> be<00:02:50.640> exact<00:02:51.150> perfectly

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
you want it to be exact perfectly

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.900

but<00:06:04.130> it<00:06:04.550> does<00:06:04.790> it<00:06:04.970> is<00:06:05.120> kind<00:06:05.330> of<00:06:05.360> nice<00:06:05.540> that<00:06:05.780> it

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
but it does it is kind of nice that it

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.660 
but it does it is kind of nice that it
shakes<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:06.410> little<00:06:06.530> just<00:06:06.950> because<00:06:07.250> I'm<00:06:07.430> sure<00:06:07.640> I

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
shakes a little just because I'm sure I

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.240 
shakes a little just because I'm sure I
can<00:06:07.820> make<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:08.150> a<00:06:08.210> little<00:06:08.330> more<00:06:08.450> tight<00:06:09.140> on<00:06:10.070> the

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
can make it a little more tight on the

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.250 
can make it a little more tight on the
setting<00:06:10.610> but<00:06:10.850> it<00:06:11.180> is<00:06:11.300> nice<00:06:11.480> that<00:06:11.540> it<00:06:11.810> shake<00:06:12.050> so

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
setting but it is nice that it shake so

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.900 
setting but it is nice that it shake so
it's<00:06:12.410> not<00:06:12.500> putting<00:06:12.800> stress<00:06:13.190> on<00:06:13.250> where<00:06:13.820> the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
it's not putting stress on where the

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.180 
it's not putting stress on where the
suction<00:06:14.390> is<00:06:14.540> so<00:06:15.080> you<00:06:15.140> know<00:06:15.380> it's<00:06:15.620> really<00:06:15.890> not

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
suction is so you know it's really not

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.950 
suction is so you know it's really not
going<00:06:16.460> to<00:06:16.580> pop<00:06:16.880> off<00:06:17.090> where<00:06:17.360> the<00:06:17.390> suction<00:06:17.840> is

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
going to pop off where the suction is

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.420 
going to pop off where the suction is
especially<00:06:18.440> because<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:18.710> little<00:06:18.860> shake<00:06:19.220> is

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
especially because that little shake is

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.020 
especially because that little shake is
there<00:06:20.180> but<00:06:20.750> anyways<00:06:21.590> I<00:06:21.980> mean<00:06:22.160> you<00:06:22.460> really<00:06:22.670> see

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
there but anyways I mean you really see

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.910

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.860 
you've got no issues with it's coming
off<00:06:25.100> I<00:06:25.460> mean<00:06:25.490> it<00:06:25.700> doesn't<00:06:26.000> distort<00:06:26.390> distract

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
off I mean it doesn't distort distract

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.570
