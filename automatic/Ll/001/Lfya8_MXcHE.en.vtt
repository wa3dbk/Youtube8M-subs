00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello to all today we find ourselves 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.839
 for a particular video on my 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.519
 chain I simply decided 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.200
 to introduce a new category of 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.780
 videos I will introduce you 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.190
 creations I do gold video so this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.870
 will not be creations I'm doing 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.670
 during my tutorial but creations that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.740
 you do not know yet so that's it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.270
 I hope you like the concept and we 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.580
 will start all over again with creations 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.369
 which starts dating a little bit 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 first here is my very first creation 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 so this is the kinder of course 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 I already showed you in my 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 video faq and in some lives too 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.649
 I think nothing folichon but good 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's my first creation that he 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.730
 is very particular to heart very little 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 after I realized that 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 portal companion so here I was 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.829
 quite happy with the result on the moment 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.899
 but in fact with hindsight now I 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.050
 really find it absolutely wrong 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 is there really no clean saab before 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 can be everywhere but the same 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.920
 sentimental I like a lot a little 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.350
 mario cube that I had realized the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.489
 for a very long time like this one sees there nothing 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 very particular 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.260
 it's the first one I had 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.710
 realized and we continue with the famous 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.710
 banana skin in mario kart so lane 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.939
 new what it looks like for m and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 old creations I'm not going 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.360
 to dwell on it a lot but for the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.400
 newer creations I wanted 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.740
 show in more detail one day it was me 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.479
 taken here I had a big delusion I 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 wanted to make a carnivorous plant of 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.790
 Mario version greediness so I did 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.549
 a little the main colors and as 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.810
 haunting, ie champagne 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.009
 chocolate after I made a macaroon 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.340
 it was my first macaroon 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.970
 besides and there a kind of I do not know 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 no lollipops maybe borrow a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 poet and that as you want and I 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.280
 like it a lot 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.600
 also if some of you know 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.490
 League of Legends 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.770
 you will definitely recognize the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.020
 little cupcake of mulhouse I had 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 really struggled to make the basis of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.649
 cupcake 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.969
 here I am not going to make my mold in 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:10.229
 So here is the little anecdote 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.670
 then a little bit alone this is the one 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.970
 and every first creation is often 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.190
 like that and to finish on old 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.470
 creations we will obviously talk 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.690
 of walkie talkie donatella 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.430
 it was my old picture profits on 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.860
 youtube and that's actually my current 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.299
 on Facebook 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.269
 so here are many of you 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.769
 request a tutorial to realize it and I 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.799
 really do not know if I'll do it at all 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.299
 case I do not know when to 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.069
 the moment I really have other videos 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.610
 that I really want to do before 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.260
 this tutorial has it so here I do not know the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:51.329
 everything when I do it with the little one 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:53.040
 choir of cream on hot chocolate 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.780
 video where I show you my old 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.670
 creations is now over 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 I hope you enjoyed it and that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 you like the concept that I show you 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 creations that I do off all 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.560
 just the next it will be fine 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.510
 obviously with more creations 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
 recent and who I hope you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.319
 will appeal much I made this one 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.209
 do not know if I will have regularity 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.340
 particular for this type of video because 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.459
 it just depends on the number 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.290
 of creations that I do and so I do not 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.930
 do not know if I'll have time to do it 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.549
 in addition to the videos not anyway I 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.000
 will keep you informed on the networks 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.230
 social 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.359
 you will find the links in the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.859
 description i'm telling you to friday for 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.859
 a new tutorial by everyone
