00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
computer so it's gonna work just like

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
computer so it's gonna work just like
you<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.899> any<00:00:55.140> computer<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.739> touchscreen

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you know any computer it is touchscreen

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
you know any computer it is touchscreen
you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> write<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.020> move<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> mouse

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you can write you can move the mouse

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.840 
you can write you can move the mouse
there's<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.070> buttons<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> side<00:00:59.820> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
there's some buttons on the side that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
there's some buttons on the side that
kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.359> thing<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.320> navigate<00:01:01.590> around

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
kind of thing you just navigate around

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
kind of thing you just navigate around
so<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> theory<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.049> sit<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.290> you

so we're gonna see if we take it up a
stand<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.860> probably<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.189> turn<00:01:32.340> itself<00:01:32.610> off

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
stand is probably gonna turn itself off

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
stand is probably gonna turn itself off
go<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> Microsoft

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
go for it all right so this is Microsoft

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.149 
go for it all right so this is Microsoft
super<00:01:36.360> display<00:01:36.840> technology<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.070> was

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
super display technology it was

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.310 
super display technology it was
codenamed<00:01:38.369> mera<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> while<00:01:39.450> yes<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.259> now

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
codenamed mera for a while yes and now

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
codenamed mera for a while yes and now
it's<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.189> available<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.820> think

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

you guys probably saw some of this it's
the<00:01:44.100> pollutants<00:01:44.970> yeah<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.470> mean

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the pollutants yeah so this is I mean

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.899 
the pollutants yeah so this is I mean
it's<00:01:46.740> sort<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> tablet<00:01:47.340> PC<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it's sort of like a tablet PC but of

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
it's sort of like a tablet PC but of
course<00:01:48.090> there's<00:01:48.210> no<00:01:48.299> actual<00:01:48.540> PC<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.049> there

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
course there's no actual PC in there

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
course there's no actual PC in there
right<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.220> don't<00:01:50.369> need<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.579> stand<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.090> and

face<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.800> get<00:02:38.950> exactly<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.520> there's<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.790> few

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
face I get exactly and there's a few

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.970 
face I get exactly and there's a few
drawbacks<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:40.570> we<00:02:40.750> got<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:40.930> say<00:02:41.230> one<00:02:41.770> is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
drawbacks to this we got to say one is

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.320 
drawbacks to this we got to say one is
it<00:02:42.130> doesn't<00:02:42.280> work<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.670> only<00:02:42.790> works<00:02:43.000> with<00:02:43.150> newer

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
it doesn't work it only works with newer

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.000 
it doesn't work it only works with newer
max<00:02:43.630> we<00:02:43.840> had<00:02:43.930> an<00:02:43.990> old<00:02:44.110> Mac<00:02:44.320> here<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.650> could<00:02:44.800> not

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
max we had an old Mac here we could not

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.170 
max we had an old Mac here we could not
get<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.340> work<00:02:45.520> that<00:02:45.730> wasn't<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
get it to work that wasn't for the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.910 
get it to work that wasn't for the
longest<00:02:46.480> time<00:02:46.720> we<00:02:46.870> had<00:02:46.960> emergency<00:02:47.260> new<00:02:47.680> Mac

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
longest time we had emergency new Mac

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.560 
longest time we had emergency new Mac
replacement<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.940> even<00:02:52.210> think<00:02:52.330> it's<00:02:52.450> not

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
replacement and even think it's not

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.940 
replacement and even think it's not
gonna<00:02:52.660> work<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.020> your<00:02:53.110> PC<00:02:53.410> unless<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.860> buy

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
gonna work with your PC unless you buy

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.050 
gonna work with your PC unless you buy
an<00:02:54.040> extra<00:02:54.190> converter<00:02:54.550> which<00:02:54.730> i<00:02:54.790> think<00:02:54.880> is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
an extra converter which i think is

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.970 
an extra converter which i think is
about<00:02:55.120> $300<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:55.990> it's<00:02:56.590> kind<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:56.770> a<00:02:56.860> lot<00:02:56.950> of

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
about $300 and it's kind of a lot of

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.380 
about $300 and it's kind of a lot of
trouble<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.340> if<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.520> already<00:02:57.610> have<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:58.240> new

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
trouble but if you already have a new

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.630 
trouble but if you already have a new
Mac<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.870> money<00:02:59.470> you're<00:02:59.680> saving<00:02:59.950> because<00:03:00.550> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
Mac that money you're saving because the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640 
Mac that money you're saving because the
price<00:03:00.820> drop<00:03:01.150> take<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.600> extra<00:03:01.810> $500<00:03:02.380> by<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
price drop take that extra $500 by the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.680 
price drop take that extra $500 by the
converter<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.250> still<00:03:03.490> have<00:03:03.670> $200<00:03:04.510> left

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
converter and you still have $200 left

are<00:04:37.850> getting<00:04:37.910> so<00:04:38.120> cheesy<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:38.630> know<00:04:38.780> it's<00:04:39.050> like

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
are getting so cheesy you know it's like

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.510 
are getting so cheesy you know it's like
that<00:04:39.350> kind<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.590> thing<00:04:39.710> like<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:40.010> technology

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
that kind of thing like this technology

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.860 
that kind of thing like this technology
is<00:04:40.610> really<00:04:40.790> coming<00:04:40.970> down<00:04:41.090> in<00:04:41.270> price<00:04:41.449> becoming

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
is really coming down in price becoming

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.480 
is really coming down in price becoming
more<00:04:42.110> available<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.620> regular<00:04:42.919> user<00:04:43.100> right

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
more available so the regular user right

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.530 
more available so the regular user right
but<00:04:43.699> I<00:04:43.760> don't<00:04:43.820> think<00:04:44.030> it's<00:04:44.120> gonna<00:04:44.210> show<00:04:44.419> up<00:04:44.479> in

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
but I don't think it's gonna show up in

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.510 
but I don't think it's gonna show up in
my<00:04:44.630> house<00:04:44.780> anytime<00:04:45.020> soon<00:04:45.350> no<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.280> one

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
my house anytime soon no but this one

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.010 
my house anytime soon no but this one
unlike<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.090> cinema<00:04:47.360> display<00:04:47.570> this<00:04:47.720> one<00:04:47.870> does

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
unlike the cinema display this one does

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.950 
unlike the cinema display this one does
work<00:04:48.169> with<00:04:48.290> Mac<00:04:48.470> or<00:04:48.830> PC<00:04:48.889> or<00:04:49.190> Linux<00:04:49.850> or<00:04:50.090> UNIX<00:04:50.120> so

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
work with Mac or PC or Linux or UNIX so

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.600 
work with Mac or PC or Linux or UNIX so
and<00:04:51.560> when<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.830> move<00:04:51.979> them<00:04:52.070> out<00:04:52.190> here<00:04:52.430> it's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
and when you move them out here it's

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.520 
and when you move them out here it's
really<00:04:52.790> it's<00:04:53.120> it's<00:04:53.330> more<00:04:53.780> of<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.139> that<00:04:54.380> you

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
really it's it's more of like that you

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.170 
really it's it's more of like that you
can<00:04:54.650> see<00:04:54.800> in<00:04:54.860> your<00:04:54.979> peripheral<00:04:55.430> vision<00:04:55.550> yeah

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
can see in your peripheral vision yeah

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.490 
can see in your peripheral vision yeah
you<00:04:56.240> can<00:04:56.389> put<00:04:56.510> them<00:04:56.600> all<00:04:56.720> around<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:57.110> yeah

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
you can put them all around you yeah

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.020 
you can put them all around you yeah
cool<00:04:57.950> yes<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.460> is<00:05:00.610> actually<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.760> early

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
cool yes this is actually the early

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.270 
cool yes this is actually the early
adopter<00:05:02.389> gadget<00:05:02.750> lever<00:05:02.930> yeah<00:05:03.290> wants<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.830> you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
adopter gadget lever yeah wants to you

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.350 
adopter gadget lever yeah wants to you
know<00:05:04.370> once<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.760> lot<00:05:04.940> of<00:05:05.000> people<00:05:05.180> are<00:05:05.240> using

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
know once a lot of people are using

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.560 
know once a lot of people are using
multiple<00:05:05.720> monitors<00:05:05.810> yeah<00:05:06.910> all<00:05:07.910> right<00:05:08.120> should

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
multiple monitors yeah all right should

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:17.409 
multiple monitors yeah all right should
we<00:05:08.600> move<00:05:08.780> on<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.440> mega<00:05:09.650> okay<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:17.150> can't

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
we move on to the mega okay you can't

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:18.850 
we move on to the mega okay you can't
really<00:05:17.570> see<00:05:17.780> that<00:05:17.810> well<00:05:18.169> right<00:05:18.350> now<00:05:18.470> because

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
really see that well right now because

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.490 
really see that well right now because
it<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.760> little<00:05:20.120> bit<00:05:20.270> light<00:05:20.450> it's<00:05:21.020> based<00:05:21.320> on

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
it is a little bit light it's based on

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.200 
it is a little bit light it's based on
projector<00:05:22.100> technology<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.760> projectors

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
projector technology the projectors

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.360 
projector technology the projectors
right<00:05:23.479> under<00:05:23.810> where<00:05:24.320> Leo<00:05:24.560> is<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.130> can<00:05:25.250> just

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
right under where Leo is you can just

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.340 
right under where Leo is you can just
lift<00:05:25.520> it<00:05:25.639> up<00:05:25.700> actually<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.300> you<00:05:26.389> can<00:05:26.539> you<00:05:27.320> can

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
lift it up actually and you can you can

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.960 
lift it up actually and you can you can
take<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.740> look<00:05:27.950> at<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.340> did<00:05:28.580> we<00:05:28.669> say<00:05:28.789> what<00:05:28.910> this

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
take a look at it did we say what this

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.210 
take a look at it did we say what this
is<00:05:29.150> this<00:05:29.240> is<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.479> lumens<00:05:29.900> 180<00:05:30.410> display<00:05:30.830> yes

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
is this is the lumens 180 display yes

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.770 
is this is the lumens 180 display yes
and<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.550> point<00:05:31.789> is<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.270> it's<00:05:32.419> in<00:05:32.660> your

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
and the point is that it's in your

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.060 
and the point is that it's in your
peripheral<00:05:33.169> vision<00:05:33.500> as<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:33.740> look<00:05:33.889> at<00:05:34.010> you

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
peripheral vision as you look at you

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.890 
peripheral vision as you look at you
know<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.250> see<00:05:34.520> up<00:05:34.669> you<00:05:34.880> see<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.060> sides<00:05:35.450> all

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
know you see up you see the sides all

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.719 
know you see up you see the sides all
you<00:05:36.200> see<00:05:36.410> is<00:05:36.530> what's<00:05:36.740> in<00:05:36.889> there<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.370> it

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
you see is what's in there and it

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.159 
you see is what's in there and it
connects<00:05:38.090> actually<00:05:38.510> just<00:05:38.750> straight<00:05:38.930> to<00:05:39.050> the

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
connects actually just straight to the

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.710 
connects actually just straight to the
port<00:05:39.440> on<00:05:39.560> your<00:05:39.590> computer<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.340> you<00:05:40.669> need<00:05:40.720> any

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
port on your computer and you need any

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.839 
port on your computer and you need any
good<00:05:42.200> graphics<00:05:42.770> card<00:05:43.010> let's<00:05:43.220> take<00:05:43.340> dress<00:05:43.639> drop

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
good graphics card let's take dress drop

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.070 
good graphics card let's take dress drop
the<00:05:43.970> lights<00:05:44.150> a<00:05:44.240> little<00:05:44.330> bit<00:05:44.450> could<00:05:44.780> I<00:05:44.870> play

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
the lights a little bit could I play

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.600 
the lights a little bit could I play
because<00:05:45.530> this<00:05:45.680> would<00:05:45.800> be<00:05:45.830> so<00:05:46.070> cool<00:05:46.280> with<00:05:46.370> quite

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
because this would be so cool with quite

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.010 
because this would be so cool with quite
three<00:05:46.849> because<00:05:47.000> it<00:05:47.120> really<00:05:47.300> does<00:05:47.479> go<00:05:47.630> right<00:05:47.810> to

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
three because it really does go right to

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.930 
three because it really does go right to
the<00:05:48.139> edge<00:05:48.650> of<00:05:48.830> your<00:05:48.919> peripheral<00:05:49.370> well<00:05:49.610> you

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
the edge of your peripheral well you

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.610 
the edge of your peripheral well you
need<00:05:50.090> a<00:05:50.120> little<00:05:50.479> bit<00:05:50.690> you<00:05:51.110> need<00:05:51.229> to<00:05:51.289> adapt<00:05:51.500> the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
need a little bit you need to adapt the

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.440 
need a little bit you need to adapt the
software<00:05:51.800> a<00:05:52.070> little<00:05:52.220> bit<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.729> they<00:05:52.970> they<00:05:53.389> do

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
software a little bit and they they do

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.180 
software a little bit and they they do
offer<00:05:53.780> like<00:05:54.530> all<00:05:54.650> that<00:05:54.830> stuff<00:05:54.860> on<00:05:55.070> their

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
offer like all that stuff on their

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.640 
offer like all that stuff on their
website<00:05:55.550> you<00:05:56.120> know<00:05:56.270> ways<00:05:56.479> that<00:05:56.720> you<00:05:56.870> can<00:05:57.080> adapt

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
website you know ways that you can adapt

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.790 
website you know ways that you can adapt
like<00:05:57.860> quake<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.700> say<00:05:59.150> on<00:05:59.270> this<00:05:59.800> because

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
like quake to say on this because

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.500 
like quake to say on this because
there's<00:06:01.010> let's<00:06:01.669> not<00:06:01.820> drop<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.180> light<00:06:02.330> so<00:06:02.450> we

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
there's let's not drop the light so we

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.900 
there's let's not drop the light so we
can<00:06:02.660> take<00:06:02.840> a<00:06:02.870> look<00:06:03.050> at<00:06:03.200> it<00:06:03.349> because<00:06:04.190> when<00:06:04.789> you

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
can take a look at it because when you

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.610 
can take a look at it because when you
run<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.300> there's<00:06:05.510> no<00:06:05.690> distortion<00:06:06.260> on<00:06:06.349> the<00:06:06.380> size

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
run it there's no distortion on the size

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.230 
run it there's no distortion on the size

this<00:06:19.290> is<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.590> smallest<00:06:19.860> one<00:06:20.070> you<00:06:20.250> can

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
this is the smallest one you can

this is the smallest one you can
actually<00:06:20.520> get<00:06:20.700> bigger<00:06:20.910> and<00:06:21.120> more<00:06:21.210> expensive

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
actually get bigger and more expensive

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.270 
actually get bigger and more expensive
ones<00:06:21.810> than<00:06:22.260> this<00:06:22.410> if<00:06:22.740> you<00:06:22.890> want<00:06:23.040> these<00:06:23.130> are

ones than this if you want these are

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.170 
ones than this if you want these are
mostly<00:06:23.550> they're<00:06:23.730> used<00:06:23.910> for<00:06:24.030> flight

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
mostly they're used for flight

corporations autos you see an architect

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.610 
corporations autos you see an architect
might<00:06:27.390> do<00:06:27.540> it<00:06:27.630> for<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:27.810> walkthrough<00:06:28.080> yes

museums they're not even actually used
and<00:06:32.550> you'd<00:06:33.150> think<00:06:33.300> it<00:06:33.450> would<00:06:33.540> be<00:06:33.570> cool<00:06:33.780> in

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
and you'd think it would be cool in

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.150 
and you'd think it would be cool in
arcade<00:06:34.260> but<00:06:34.470> they're<00:06:34.560> not<00:06:34.620> even<00:06:34.830> used<00:06:35.010> there

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
arcade but they're not even used there

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.380 
arcade but they're not even used there
yet<00:06:35.370> because<00:06:35.460> they're<00:06:35.790> really<00:06:36.060> expensive

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
yet because they're really expensive

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.180 
yet because they're really expensive
expensive<00:06:36.960> but<00:06:37.440> I<00:06:37.470> think<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.890> mean<00:06:38.010> I<00:06:38.070> think

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
expensive but I think I mean I think

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.530 
expensive but I think I mean I think
with<00:06:38.430> any<00:06:38.520> technology<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.180> price<00:06:39.360> is

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
with any technology the price is

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.730 
with any technology the price is
dropping<00:06:39.840> and<00:06:39.960> I<00:06:40.050> would<00:06:40.170> love<00:06:40.320> to<00:06:40.410> have<00:06:40.530> one<00:06:40.560> of

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
dropping and I would love to have one of

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.520 
dropping and I would love to have one of
these<00:06:40.800> larger<00:06:41.600> in<00:06:42.600> my<00:06:42.780> own<00:06:42.870> home<00:06:43.080> and<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.320> think

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
these larger in my own home and I think

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.610 
these larger in my own home and I think
I<00:06:43.740> think<00:06:44.610> games<00:06:44.850> are<00:06:45.030> gonna<00:06:45.120> start<00:06:45.450> to<00:06:45.600> be<00:06:45.630> put

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
I think games are gonna start to be put
