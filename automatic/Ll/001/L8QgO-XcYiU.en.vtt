00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
weight quickly let's say before a

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.160 
weight quickly let's say before a
wedding<00:00:08.550> or<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> special<00:00:09.420> event<00:00:09.510> or<00:00:09.990> their

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
athletes and they need to get rid of

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.629 
athletes and they need to get rid of
that<00:00:12.719> excess<00:00:13.170> water<00:00:13.380> weight<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.340> not

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
that excess water weight this is not

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.890 
that excess water weight this is not
that<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.089> not<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.420> video<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.750> about

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that is not what this video is about

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
that is not what this video is about
because<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.980> recommend<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.699> I

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
because I do not recommend that I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.700 
because I do not recommend that I
personally<00:00:18.510> think<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.810> unhealthy<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
personally think it's unhealthy for you

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.769 
personally think it's unhealthy for you
this<00:00:20.580> video<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.939> more<00:00:21.060> about<00:00:21.270> whether<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.689> not

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
this video is more about whether or not

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.670 
this video is more about whether or not
I<00:00:22.050> think<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.560> suit<00:00:23.250> gives<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.640> result<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
I think the suit gives you result and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.050 
I think the suit gives you result and
other<00:00:25.680> things<00:00:25.920> associated<00:00:26.189> with<00:00:26.460> safety<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
other things associated with safety and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.950 
other things associated with safety and
so<00:00:27.240> forth

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
so forth

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.820 
so forth
this<00:00:28.920> suit<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.429> got<00:00:29.789> probably<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.960> two

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
this suit I got probably about two

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
this suit I got probably about two
months<00:00:32.070> ago<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.820> roast<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.420> $6.99

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
months ago I got a roast for about $6.99

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.790 
months ago I got a roast for about $6.99
which<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:36.559> it's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> nice

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
which is not that much it's a nice

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
which is not that much it's a nice
little<00:00:37.950> suit<00:00:38.309> fits<00:00:38.760> well<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.450> sweat<00:00:39.719> very

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
little suit fits well you do sweat very

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.380 
little suit fits well you do sweat very
well<00:00:40.200> snow<00:00:40.440> elastic<00:00:41.160> comfort<00:00:41.820> fit<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.239> so

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
well snow elastic comfort fit there so

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.410 
well snow elastic comfort fit there so
it<00:00:42.510> does<00:00:42.890> have<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:43.980> elastic<00:00:44.190> fit<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.210> thing

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it does have an elastic fit the thing

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
it does have an elastic fit the thing
the<00:00:45.570> reason<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.899> got<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> wasn't<00:00:46.829> for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the reason I got it for it wasn't for

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
the reason I got it for it wasn't for
the<00:00:47.070> weight<00:00:47.309> loss<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.030> personally

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the weight loss because I personally

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
the weight loss because I personally
think<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> lose<00:00:49.170> weight<00:00:49.200> change

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
think if you want to lose weight change

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.779 
think if you want to lose weight change
your<00:00:50.039> diets<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.850> better<00:00:51.980> exercise<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.520> have

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
your diets you better exercise and have

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.069 
your diets you better exercise and have
a<00:00:53.820> positive<00:00:54.329> attitude<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a positive attitude about it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
a positive attitude about it
this<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:55.949> more<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.219> less<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
this was more or less for just kind of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.299 
this was more or less for just kind of
detoxification<00:00:57.629> part<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:59.070> there's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
detoxification part of it now there's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
detoxification part of it now there's
two<00:00:59.460> schools<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> thought<00:00:59.910> one<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
two schools of thought one is go in the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.889 
two schools of thought one is go in the
sauna<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.430> detox<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.239> with

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sauna and you can detox that way with

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
sauna and you can detox that way with
also<00:01:04.199> cleansing<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.890> juices<00:01:05.369> or<00:01:05.700> other

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
also cleansing it with juices or other

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
also cleansing it with juices or other
programs<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.600> which<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.930> great<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
programs as well which are great and I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
programs as well which are great and I
think<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> sauna<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.490> way<00:01:08.700> better<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:09.150> using

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
think the sauna is way better than using

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.359 
think the sauna is way better than using
this<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> only<00:01:10.409> reason<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.740> say<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.040> just

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this and the only reason I say is just

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
this and the only reason I say is just
because<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> material<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> suit<00:01:12.689> it's

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because the material of the suit it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.399 
because the material of the suit it's
that<00:01:13.320> poly<00:01:14.210> whatever<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.420> made<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.810> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that poly whatever it's made out of it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.070 
that poly whatever it's made out of it's
just<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.509> guess<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
just it's not good I guess have that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
just it's not good I guess have that
when<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.380> pores<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.220> open<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.640> sweating

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
when your pores are open you're sweating

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.200 
when your pores are open you're sweating
and<00:01:21.180> yeah<00:01:22.009> you<00:01:23.009> are<00:01:23.159> susceptible<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.970> whatever

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and yeah you are susceptible to whatever

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
and yeah you are susceptible to whatever
chemicals<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.049> suit<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:25.799> I'm<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
