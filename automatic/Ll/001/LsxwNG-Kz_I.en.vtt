00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.110
 ah 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 and 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.300
 what happened with the prizes is that 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.150
 when the first versions started 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.350
 that were made other things were rewarded 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.060
 also the problems only 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.270
 modifications are awarded actors 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.939
 and released and what we did from the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.630
 2002 was to decide to make some prizes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.420
 shock that really rewards not only 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.090
 music and that's why the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.700
 music progress 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.060
 we are doing this 2013 side for your 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.500
 number the idea was how are you going from 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.970
 what was happening and what was happening 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.399
 counting from the music in 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.530
 Colombia to give him something back was 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.780
 an acknowledgment to the musicians was 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 give them a place and somehow 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.799
 start to bond with what was 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.450
 happening in the whole world in terms of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.069
 that kind of activations activities 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 when they are in the arc that learned that 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:50.159
 what we do is review the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.399
 audiovisual material from the hand of the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.980
 jaime team then we do with a 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
 selecting each video equipment 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.970
 obviously you are in a very task 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.370
 rigorous from the technical side of the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.550
 part of how that video was made and 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.080
 then we cross as our opinions 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.760
 we share and we get out of there at 10 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.640

 look to the future of what is 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.290
 happening in the audiovisual and that the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.910
 people who are participating and that the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.110
 people that because it also rewards and 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.030
 people who are voting all the time 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.440
 understand that it is not a selection that 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.940
 We do this for pleasure, we do not do it 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.710
 because it seems nice because we 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.210
 it seems cool really is because in 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.250
 technical issues and issues 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.290
 aesthetic and then some things there 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.110
 much more thoroughly with the subject 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.120
 audiovisual and video clip is in charge of 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.350
 people trained for this people who have 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.300
 worked in this industry during 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.860
 a lot of time and people who do not 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.580
 only we respect but that 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.750
 the general world of art cinema 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.460
 of the entertainment of colombia los 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.160
 know and respect them also 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.220
 the festival of shorts from Bogotá bogotá 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.970
 summer the alliance with the south magazine 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.180
 It is first of all an honor especially because 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.120
 the support for the path through 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.010
 experience that the magazine has in 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.560
 musical field but additionally by 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.080
 for the credibility and for the way in 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.060
 that the Colombian music scene 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.880
 assumes the importance it has within 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.590
 they provide us and they have their great 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.460
 power of call among the musicians 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.490
 that make them live shocks and 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.530
 all the selection of videoclips and bogota 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.230
 has through the platform I to 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.540
 end discs in which he receives works 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.520
 for the short film festival that 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.590
 performs from 5 to 11 in Bogota 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.870
 to the possibility of reaching the 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.190
 filmmakers then we managed to gather 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.090
 as the force of great artists with 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.580
 restless filmmakers who are 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.860
 seeking to make themselves known through the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.900
 videos and I think football I think 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.630
 that we are above 600 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.920
 registered to see arrive at 10 but 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.810
 about two and a half months in which 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.820
 they listened and saw first 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.830
 We in some categories were 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.270
 seeing what else we could pass to them what 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.560
 It is also published throughout the year 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.720
 on the internet then we make a 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.430
 review of that and we started sharing 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.440
 information mails for more or 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.690
 minus about three four weeks until 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.520
 we already have the final list that is the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.950
 I was in shock right now 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.410
 puntocom in voting with this video 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.540

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.460
 top awards people will be able to vote for their 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.800
 favorite and it's very valuable because they're going to 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.780
 have this recognition in addition to this 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.860

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.700
 proposals 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.680
 it's going to be a prize more towards the 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:50.020
 director that towards the musical artist 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:54.190

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.320
 14 your prize and those 14 one is the best 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.840
 of the pink team which means that 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.180
 of his prize that means a lot then 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.360
 for the industry for shock and for the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.240
 artists the girl and at the same time that 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.640
 it's going to be a waste of time to tell the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.100
 people from youtube is a way of 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.440
 cinematographic expression that has 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.570
 very high value and that reveals many 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.730
 things of what you can even get to 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.920
 be happening and I could do it towards 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.470
 forward Colombian sessions we have 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.690
 received videos of all kinds of gender 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.230
 all have been seen and have been 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.920
 evaluated 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.940
 from the coherence between the 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.560
 realization and the artist's search 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.750
 musical we are opening a path 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.640
 important as well as when I started 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.080
 making these awards what they are 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.389
 doing with us and really 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.250
 and creating an industry that will take 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.990
 who knows how long but it is 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.849
 doing the homework we invite all of you 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.560

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.599

 and we can see in detail and on screen 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.240
 giant that we almost never have the 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.849
 opportunity to see in detail all the 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.219
 realization the video clip has gone to 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.199
 tiny formats then it's a 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:17.939
 very cool opportunity for the 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.939
 filmmakers share
