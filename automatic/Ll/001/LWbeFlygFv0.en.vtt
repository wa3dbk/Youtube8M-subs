00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.679
 I also welcome you this week 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.210
 heartily to the sak tv magazine the gas 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 condensing technology has been with users 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.340
 and skilled trades established that was before 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 Ten years later, things are very different 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 had to do conviction work 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.840
 become 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.090
 but where does this technology stand in ten? 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.119
 years, it continues to be one 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.109
 important base in the heat supply 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 before we get the situation of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.009
 illuminate today's condensing technology 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.309
 and take a look into the future 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.110
 first, a look back in 2004 so before 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.579
 ten years was the condensing technology 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.350
 actually already known 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.649
 but skilled craftsmen still existed 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 We have a great deal of training 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.079
 at the time our company vaillant ours 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.899
 professional craftsmen in large measure to the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.550
 New equipment trained at that time was the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 technology for many professional craftsmen 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.149
 new one is very strong on the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.530
 System thoughts received there were new ones 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.210
 exhaust to be made of plastic there was 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.860
 important information regarding the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 condensate removal that was also at that time 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 new and of course maintenance and 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.600
 Service topics were at that time 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.159
 skilled trades very much in demand 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 technically mature and comfortable 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.450
 systems are available today 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.600
 today, the condensing appliances 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.580
 of course fully mature we have high 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.070
 modern and highly efficient pumps 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.619
 integrated we have a lot of sensorics 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.000
 in the devices installed a high 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 modulation and a high 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.560
 operational safety enable the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.900
 Devices themselves are from the gas 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.579
 combustion her gas adaptive there is 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.040
 an electronic air composite in the 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.350
 Contrary to earlier where the gas is air 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.720
 verbund was pneumatic and we provide 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.090
 Of course this is a very good one today 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.439
 Adaptation to the heating system safe and sound 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.329
 synonymous in conjunction with the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.640
 control technology the control technology 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.920
 and the electronic devices are playing tight 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.140
 together, for example, during the adaptation 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.659
 to the heating curve of the professional craftsmen 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.070
 today, the heating curve does not need 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.500
 to set more that makes the device 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 automatically and also the performance of 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 device is automatically on the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.379
 lowest possible point and reduced 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.000
 There you can do a lot 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.930
 energy and then of course also cost 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.769
 saving you see weiland energy-equipment 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.140
 today one recognizes here the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.760
 state-of-the-art high-efficiency pump 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.819
 no longer manually adjustable 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.260
 but from the electronics exactly 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.680
 adjusted and monitored 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.090
 one recognizes here in this area the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.040
 electronic gas air composite with 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.579
 electronic gas fittings and 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 special sensors also in the gas way and 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.810
 you can see it in the back area 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.220
 modern temperature sensors and modern ones 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.799
 flow sensors to everyone 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.049
 operating state of the heat exchanger and 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.430
 of the heating system monitor the 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.829
 condensing technology will also be available in the future 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.079
 an important but changed role in 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.239
 The heating technology is currently playing in the 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.459
 System technology is particularly important 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.650
 that there is the condensing technology as 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.409
 an important pillar sees the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.780
 condensing technology itself is becoming and 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.129
 after more and more in hybrid systems like 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.910
 for example with heat pumps 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.010
 combined heat and power coupling and 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.260
 this combination makes it possible 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.579
 with large systems still much 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.060
 to run more efficiently 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:28.329
 a heat pump, for example, can 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.060
 a basic heating load for the building 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.060
 ensure and a condensing boiler in the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.930
 system represents for example one 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.180
 highly efficient and hygienic 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.129
 Drinking water preparation sure yes what we 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.430
 see here is one already today 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.069
 available combination of gas calorific value 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.430
 technology and cogeneration like 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.129
 for example, a modern eco tech 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.379
 Exclusive gas condensing boiler and one 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.750
 micro power heat coupling device here 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.970
 Make sure you're in one 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.549
 building the base load for electricity and 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.810
 heat continuously at all times through the 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.879
 force heat coupling device to 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.639
 provide the device and the condensing boiler 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.909
 plays the role here for higher 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.560
 the heat is then at strong 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.209
 outside temperatures at strong low 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.760
 outside temperatures is available 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.709
 This technology will be in ten years 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.539
 be increasingly standard on the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.340
 Heating technology can be used by heating engineers 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:24.979
 also in ten years 6 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.740
 of course it will still be there in 2024 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.960
 the condensing technology ii both in old buildings 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.279
 as well as being used in new construction 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.349
 just in the big one 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:35.810
 rehabilitation area will be the calorific value 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.889
 technology in 2024 still theirs 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.840
 application case find 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.180
 but there too strengthened in hybrids 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.669
 systems that means the combination 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.650
 with heat pump with combined heat and power plants 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.419
 or even with the fuel cells 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.050
 Technology becomes the condensing technology 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.029
 which actually already today from the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.669
 physical boundaries then works 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:57.409
 additionally as a supplement for a high 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.330
 Power requirements stand as they will for 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.639
 the hot water and of course 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.909
 also for the peak load heat demand there 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.919
 that was still our sak tv 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.569
 magazine for today we are already on 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.139
 thursday with the news again 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.279
 there for her 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.279
 until then, all the best
