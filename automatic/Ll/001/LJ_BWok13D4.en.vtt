00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello now we will look at how to do it in 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.840
 short a handle that is developed 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.790
 conceived and created a handle this is a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.839
 handle practically finished by itself 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:23.519
 finished sanded and then painted 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:25.859
 mounted on the instrument the handle starts 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.369
 mainly from a text link like 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.880
 this is a wooden plank of thickness 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.680
 finished 20 20 mm or 200 yuri 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.450
 this his nymph case organized 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 everything went clean sanded 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.160
 because it's still ugly until you get there 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 I go ahead with this finish 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 this and more as i then do it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 Canadian for differences in limits 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.559
 I refer to our video on the channel 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.940
 youtube explained this year 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 the differences between the various types of kidneys 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.449
 between if they go by the handle between 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.030
 rosewood to the sky and go to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.160
 keyboards and so on 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.739
 instead we will be words neither see nor of 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.799
 make fans you go to this one succeeds in Rome 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 rezzato you should see in camera 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.850
 the difference of the wood as it moves 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320
 all these marie stature that they are 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.799
 these stars ct color slightly 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.799
 different 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.090
 and this is what will become a 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.610
 handle once you know this axis 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.710
 pearled 20 mm thick 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.930
 we leave and we make a cutter with the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.420
 definitely milling machine for taps 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.840
 perfectly told the right size 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.170
 which will become ivano poles castro 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.920
 this is robert than the metal coffin 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.840
 and inserted into the handle that serves to 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.299
 adjust the curvature of the same 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 that is, depending on the zeal I turn in a 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.599
 logical sense in the other this bar 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.000
 metal on top arches or relaxes 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.770
 bending upright the handle 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.209
 once this is milled it is cut 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.970
 all the handle control with the 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:05.179
 palette and you also get this one 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.140
 once this is achieved we see the shape 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.549
 of the headstock the shape of the handle 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 milling of the trust road 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.140
 we can announce within it 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.910
 the trust road 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.590
 once inserted inside we choose 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.709
 typology life challenge we want 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.280
 attack supermarco in this case chi 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.280
 we have 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.680
 receive we can use in exotic woods e 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.630
 details with vigilant depictions and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.590
 very particular and very beautiful as 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.570
 this or they can go to 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.090
 classic and if in this case with an ace 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.090
 Romanized equal to that of the handle 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.000
 and we have an olive keyboard 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.040
 this one is the ebony fretboard 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.040
 black and white 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.720
 or these are everyone's 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.700
 details aside from the launch bitterness 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.920
 or how are the only less go 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.600
 traditional type of selection this 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.500
 end he wants all dirt missing or 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.930
 rosewood and alley in the classic one 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.350
 once you do this we have a keyboard 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.120
 glued over the handle we can 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.840
 send the keys and we reach this 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.690
 result or the ready pallet the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.430
 handle completely trimmed to keyboard 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.600
 paste all the keys already glued 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.790
 above this point we give ourselves the handle 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.180
 let's start with the rasp by hand to make the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.560
 convex delmonico delmonico bags up 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.560
 to get the finished handle 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.050
 that is this
