00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.490
 So yes, stop is bad 4 and I know that 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.000
 had been going under net already says here 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.950
 remained 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 but I think everyone can be human 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.730
 mistype that is me in the world 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.490
 Sometimes , I often get done with it 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 Yes, it's half past three and I'm here today 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.850
 not that important i do 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.189
 did not expect today 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
 namely the party of my friend and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 we still have to build a total of four and 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 I still have to bake and am actually 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.340
 I'm totally in the stress too 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.599
 even fast hydrogen clapped yes 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.510
 I think then maybe in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.230
 but I still think about the ears 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.149
 today comes just another 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 extension video to the video yesterday 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.719
 and that was the topic 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.890
 internship and I have you there 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.600
 little thing to my internship 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.129
 I'm a bit worn off me 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.719
 but you can stop the question how 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.280
 behaves one is best so you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.940
 not so exploited and thus the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.210
 not so fucking internship in german 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 and yes it is the same 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 first impression must you so if you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.239
 hold application interview have it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.519
 I had to go with that too because of mine 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.689
 my ninth internship also pulls you 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.490
 really neat 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.750
 as he learned at school 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.040
 and most do that right now 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.259
 This should be advertising samples but 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 It does not exaggerate you have to, of course 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.159
 not if you are doing internships 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.659
 starts in suit just wear guys 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.119
 do not have to wear a suit and girl 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.729
 do not need a blazer and jacket and 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.990
 wear other clothes so just pull 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.610
 just a bit ordinary at because 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.320
 girl i would just be a simple one 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.140
 top buy nothing with glasses 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 places or so stricker sounds over and over 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.579
 a beautiful rose that too easy 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.409
 simple and with the boy I would 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.759
 maybe you just guess 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.680
 neutral shirt to wear 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.689
 whether please not light green or other 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.700
 rus lipp nord or any band t 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.250
 shirts that can be pretty much 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.570
 Wrong a bad view said that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.900
 can then pretty much in the pants 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.820
 because you can easily go wrong 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.470
 even if you have piercings 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.710
 what neutral I could have had at that time 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.320
 my tunnel look in there so one of the 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.640
 she has to have a degree and a cold house 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.840
 is not that good impression if you 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.880
 follow piercing comes and or take it 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.410
 out and over, or something 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.540
 but will not be so good for space 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 but ignition just makes it so 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.430
 really not like her for example 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.880
 turning itself off is pure or if he turns 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.290
 here on and piercings is really doing 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.820
 what neutral in there so there is 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.990
 nice solutions which also the sister 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.580
 mostly use 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.260
 and there you can just one 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.490
 internet googles depending on your look like 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.970
 It's best to do that a bit 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.640
 can hide then yes in girls to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.550
 theme make-up does not exaggerate it 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.720
 your daily look makes this one 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.880
 already market sees that they maintained 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.040
 looks would have expensive hair beautiful makes 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.250
 maybe a nice hairstyle but everything 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.500
 not so quiet i'm so excited 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 but just everything totally left her 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.620
 can also go with open hand but 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.420
 then just take care so that you cared 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.500
 might look tackles wash 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.530
 not that they finished so hahn 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.830
 shows up and make-up really 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.530
 mascara the standard program though 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.840
 not that you start with smokey 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.280
 eyes and other really easy times 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.019
 Going and grad 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.570
 Application interview then easy easy 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.640
 stay and I was pretty excited 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.860
 try this a bit with grip to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.450
 get and then just makes your 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.070
 thing and you probably will 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.870
 then go to the internship probably 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.459
 has interest and conveys that that 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.010
 you are actually interested in them 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.190
 internship sure and if you 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.000
 then just loose and confident 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.680
 really that much better if you are 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.780
 then on the first day in an internship 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.370
 since you before what informs them 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.150
 then she should not wear it 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.799
 You do not have a hospital 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.410
 make sure your hair is back 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:04.250
 and I would be very happy otherwise 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.070
 Pay attention to what he puts on what the 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.170
 company and the company would like and 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.290
 then it will be fine 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.489
 always nice so always smile too 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.250
 if some of you always come across 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.739
 smile and think audience but smiles 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.639
 be friendly and just happy 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.639
 Act and then look depending on you 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.400
 as you are the first time so sit down 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.410
 looks back and shows interest 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.270
 then you explain it most of the time 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.820
 are also responsible if much more 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.889
 you are not sitting there in a pure rust 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.750
 or a big flap but always has 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.550
 a little bit forward wanted to watch 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.470
 and asks what does this mean that we 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.050
 fixed that and that in mars 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.550
 not that we are annoying right now and so 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.350
 I'm definitely even on 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.210
 That's good and impress you now 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.500
 Do a bit because if you do that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.889
 a project I had easier 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 if you want to help then then 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.000
 I would just increase it so on the first 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.130
 day of more and more freedom and more 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.660
 shows're interested and on 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:07.060
 second day I would be slow then 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.919
 help so that means together 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.960
 yes what can not do on or when 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.350
 who say yes and so fast 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.270
 I would go there and I would be in 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.700
 Hospital has everything immediately 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.680
 then I prepared the cd for free 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.060
 I stopped on the first day looked Pope 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.650
 on the second day then alone 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.210
 made because I looked at and 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.789
 then you just take an hour off 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.590
 the sisters or dear ones over you 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.780
 stand and that you should do that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.370
 show good impression if you then 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.900
 really helps and even if the first 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.690
 The never-get-done positions, then 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.160
 if you really cleans or so but the 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.620
 good thing is when you see her 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.539
 main interest and everything that you 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.970
 more and more trust that the lakes are okay 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.320
 the tanks or he can do what and then 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.270
 we can show it and always the 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.310
 Show course then it works but already 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.710
 do not overdo it you do not have to 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.360
 rausbringen or otherwise the guests otherwise 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.890
 take advantage of it you have the 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.630
 it does not find the center 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.460
 ever in the wrong direction 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.680
 but actually that is pretty easy 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.240
 he does not notice that if you only ever from 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.400
 Alone, I can help that 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.860
 if you be anywhere for example where 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.220
 is a kuli and so expect is here 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.400
 not that you bank the dj sofa or 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.500
 so it will be over again 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.850
 of course you have to take care of course 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.280
 I do not say here but I do not 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:23.570
 then the tilt position is otherwise 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.370
 can you actually during the internship 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.870
 not much wrong , whatever good 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.770
 if you take notes with me 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.449
 his set 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.919
 I always take notes 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.360
 because there are many things we do 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.310
 just do not know from the 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.810
 School world not exactly in the 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.250
 hospital and then sometimes like that 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.130
 spot and there you can the next 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.050
 day already trump that you bet this 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.199
 then then you could be a bit 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.139
 more with this expertise 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.750
 that not yet low level 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:54.830
 can talk and then the 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.389
 everything is much looser and yes if 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.520
 Her just in the hospital with the 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.080
 sisters has been sitting loosely so be 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.880
 not cramped and after a time 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.919
 they will definitely be on you 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.960
 offer as me then by now 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.750
 everyone and that is really nice 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.150
 and if you notice is about what 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.250
 Do not talk like that aloud 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.930
 but if you realize it is and open 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.639
 conversation may bring something with 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.520
 such as the children go 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.949
 ask the clinics and we find 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.870
 that and then you come into the conversation 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.449
 that it's always good if a bit too 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.160
 going personal is because then you 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:29.479
 just have a firmer bond and 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.210
 then you feel the same way 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.669
 more comfortable and the time passes that was 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.229
 it's actually an internship so that 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.970
 my tips and tricks what 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.080
 actually always works well and then 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.889
 you do not need such 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.900
 to worry 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.610
 go loose and enjoy it 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.260
 and if it is not that way try 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.520
 but you can change as well 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.530
 In any case, do not take it 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.430
 get ready 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.750
 I want to tell you a nice day 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.750
 and until 1
