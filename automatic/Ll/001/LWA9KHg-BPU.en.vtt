00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 and the sports car segment is 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.269
 perhaps the most active porsche is the leader 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.559
 indisputable though occasionally 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 appears one or another competitor 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.160
 interesting here our comparison 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.510
 between the porsche cayman and the peugeot rcz 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:25.080
 r the porsche cayman in its basic version 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.630
 comes with 275 horsepower with two 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.070
 seats lacks extra belt and comes 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.320
 with rear- wheel drive on its part the rcz 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 you are a normal production model of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.410
 you and I take you a front engine and its 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.260
 traction is forward 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.970
 It also has two rear seats with 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.420
 what can be better taken advantage of than 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.420
 the alligator 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.620
 with its 270 horsepower yours 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 The engine is not a very good option 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.120
 it is precisely your strongest point your 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.760
 engine is a four-cylinder turbo with 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 270 horsepower but the porsche 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.810
 it takes advantage has five horses 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.810
 more and its engine is six cylinders 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.970
 thanks to its front drive one 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.979
 has the impression that intuition is more 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.800
 sporty and that has one more exit 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.650
 fast it may even come to seem 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.750
 more agile in the curves 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.660
 but if we speak in general terms 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.580
 the porsche wins by not having 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.170
 turbo its output is slower but 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.850
 thanks to that it has the attraction in the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.800
 rear axle and the direction in the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
 forward his behavior in the 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 curves is much more accurate than in the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.750
 brightness 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.380
 ah 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.549
 the alligator brakes are normal 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.200
 we get the turbo brakes or 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.069
 pottery that cost at least ten 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 thousand dollars more 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.510
 still the basic brakes of the alligator 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.270
 they are much better than tall ones 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.459
 performance that you and I carry 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.630
 ride the rcz rattles nor lose 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.540
 power after three or four 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.450
 aggressive braking when taking the curves 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.829
 in terms of prices the peugeot part 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.980
 from 40 thousand euros with a 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.659
 relatively complete equipment the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.909
 Alligator in its most basic version costs 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.859
 60 thousand euros but as soon as we start 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.099
 choose some extras this increases 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.099
 considerably 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.200
 both cars are not really very 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.730
 versatile that we say although in almost 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.100
 any driving situation of iu 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.280
 by and will win, there are still 20 thousand 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.980
 euros of difference between both for that 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.020
 if we consider the relationship 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.170
 quality-price the rcz is an excellent 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.170
 option
