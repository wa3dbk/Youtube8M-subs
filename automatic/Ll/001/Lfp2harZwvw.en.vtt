00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello hello hello 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.660
 today we will talk about who wants 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 grow zucchini and pumpkin and at the same time 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:19.740
 do nothing means eat this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 method of growing zucchini 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.109
 on the compost heap she can imagine 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.650
 represent as a grid 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.219
 Here in this case, as I have a diameter 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.579
 about a meter to either square but general 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.790
 anything you do 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.829
 wooden box about the size and there 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.270
 a half and a half whether 2 by 2 it will be 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.809
 generally good cheese will always be on the sides 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.070
 in this case, the abaca mesh is dried up and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.809
 need to water more often 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.030
 but it doesn't matter if you 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 stay close two or three days 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:08.510
 you can water than the advantage of such a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.630
 such a landing that starts earlier 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.310
 the harvest 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.740
 bring zucchini and in that bushes like 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.619
 see they are powerful 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.890
 grow thorough all very well and without 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.909
 problems here even for an example near pumpkin 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 here is just something much weaker than bushes 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.979
 and there the leaves are green all rot at 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.189
 that leaves there since last year 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.090
 have they not a few years lay not 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:44.729
 mean lay one year old and in the spring I 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.229
 sprinkled crossed over the top compost somewhere 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.500
 a quarter she was level with riding 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.930
 grid yes here and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.490
 laid siege of pots 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:05.030
 pumpkin and zucchini here they grow all 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.640
 just available you can do at all 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.769
 pile a lot of big if you 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.599
 allows the area and therefore not and 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.739
 plant squash 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:23.060
 make mulching and everything will be fine 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:29.870
 will pull time from the ground wicking at all 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:31.579
 leaving let's come see what 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 there we have for yields now we have 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.709
 already the middle of summer 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.310
 mid summer and we started 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:49.459
 harvest to harvest some from the end of June 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:55.030
 here you see yes zucchini here powerful bushes 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:57.530
 and just grab everything in front of him I and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.130
 truth squander these heaps 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.720
 strong was at the level of laughter and here 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.239
 slipped already literally a quarter 2 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.510
 already even more so I recommend to everyone 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.519
 do not throw grass in the trash do 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.510
 compost heaps and compost heaps 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.510
 you can grow this whole thing 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 that is, some tearing zucchini others 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:37.220
 appear and all this during the summer up 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:40.610
 frost free so everything is just everything 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.740
 available do not need extra effort and those 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.710
 shelves nothing here she moved on 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.790
 nothing all spiders like thin branches 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.740
 all if thrown overnight rot and 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.890
 on them, the authorities can be well on top 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.260
 Mulching done at first but for now 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.130
 already drowned everything out here we don't need 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.290
 weaving no grass here will be all 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.040
 all the best to new videos to new 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.630
 meeting 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:14.290
