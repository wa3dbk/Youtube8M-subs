00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.470
 now 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.920
 when fellow colleagues today we are going to 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.690
 6 make a small board and 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.140
 back I thought I was working on 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.500
 these last weeks 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:21.180
 a small board are perinatal a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 60 x 45 board 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.800
 that is going to command a wave generator 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.090
 12 k see 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 start with salt 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.660
 has the savior 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.860
 this saving was replaced that had 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 passed because you can not do the 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:45.910
 start this Saturday was replaced by 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.910
 this that this would be a little motor 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.150
 It is a television door motor of 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.100
 car doors 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.180
 who now sees what he does when we send 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.800
 Contact 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.100
 suck what they have taken so that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.570
 between 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.350
 shinaka 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 and I'm going to start 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.120
 good is a small detail here is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.770
 of the generator 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.340
 this is the exit 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.340
 of 220 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.410
 this obviously is that it can present 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.780
 what holes have the series the 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.480
 pipes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.890
 well this has to come to what it is 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.890
 the generator package 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.530
 upstream this is the neighborhood from which 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.240
 have a 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.920
 testimony that he sends to the circuit 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.689
 the circuit of faith that his model cgm 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.689
 then do 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.510
 this is in the wake 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.970
 the memory would have to the plate the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.970
 board 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.830
 good 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.530
 now this is previously 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.730
 so home armed that what would come 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.730
 to be the attention 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.939
 after here 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.420
 this is what are the barriers are 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:38.400
 zone alarms relay contact the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.400
 alarm start and stop possible 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.850
 and there's nothing more to explain to 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.760
 perimeter 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.740
 and the emergency stop button 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.570
 in the eyes of an ox 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.970
 people who have something that was put on 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.750
 board 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.750
 They are led 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 in case of emergency there is no light 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.970
 Well, let's go 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.640
 to simulate a power cut 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.440
 first we take out what the stop 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:22.910
 emergency we do half a turn there is here 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:27.190
 what the circuit does to test 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.190
 in light of group network 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.500
 the company in this case we have what 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.520
 is 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.990
 in light of the company 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.460
 I 'll make you be here 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:51.610
 these are untouchable 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:55.710
 carrion in a circuit and this at the same time 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.720
 cow to the circuit 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.720
 well let's simulate a power cut 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.860
 let's see testimony network intention 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.490
 16 and 15 16 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.440
 15 says are states in this case we're going to 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.220
 take out the rifles would be this 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.220
 or how 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:30.210
 there he will detect the air 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.210
 is what is going to be a starter 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.380
 I put the machine in contact 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.820
 now let's go to the light 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.039
 but no 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.169
 in this stop 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.810
 delegate 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.610
 for 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.020
 and I would have to learn the network game and 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:24.480
 the generator only that I do not have the 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.850
 fuses the coil and does not do the 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.740
 switching interlocks in another video 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.110
 we will explain 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.129
 what does it mean 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.729
 as I said 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.729
 bye
