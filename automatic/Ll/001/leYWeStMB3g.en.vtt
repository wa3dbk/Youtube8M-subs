once you get an even coating take the

serrated trowel and just run it straight

you'll<00:00:59.059> have<00:00:59.300> 30<00:00:59.570> minutes<00:00:59.719> to<00:01:00.320> experiment<00:01:00.950> and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
you'll have 30 minutes to experiment and

you'll have 30 minutes to experiment and
use<00:01:01.280> your<00:01:01.460> imagination

use your imagination
before<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.050> texture<00:01:03.440> starts<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:03.949> harden<00:01:04.100> and

when you're happy with your final
pattern<00:01:16.250> then<00:01:17.120> take<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.690> trowel<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.470> just

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
pattern then take the trowel and just

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.590 
pattern then take the trowel and just
run<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.310> vertically<00:01:19.880> along<00:01:20.150> each<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.420> the

run it vertically along each of the

run it vertically along each of the
edges<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.740> clean<00:01:21.980> up<00:01:22.160> what's<00:01:22.430> spilled<00:01:22.790> over
