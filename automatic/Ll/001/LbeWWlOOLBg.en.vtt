00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 hi this is a magnet as you see 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.130
 attracts metal objects like this 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.410
 pair of scissors we showed that 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.259
 this type of objects in less than 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.199
 permanent magnets cannot produce 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.920
 energy for a variety of reasons 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.320
 physical energy conservation then 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.340
 also laws of thermodynamics and so 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.290
 but someone says well these 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.989
 laws could also change in the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.670
 future may be possible 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.400
 build an engine that produces energy 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.860
 starting from these objects 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.570
 the answer usually had the 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.970
 energy conservation 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.280
 more than a physical law one appears 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.320
 constant of the universe that is if not yes 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.570
 takes energy somewhere can't 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.699
 get out of this engine 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.989
 moreover, the world is full of technicians 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.269
 physical engineers building 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.680
 equipment with magnets and circuits 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.840
 for example microphones and speakers 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.140
 headphones are all made with the principles of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.060
 this kind that is with magnets that you 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.450
 they move thanks to inductive circuits 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.640
 so they calculate the best 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.030
 combination of magnetism 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.180
 electromagnetism electric currents 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 to get the best possible only 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.910
 for example it would be a bit strange if not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.450
 realize that all these calculations 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.150
 truths are wrong because there is a way 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.700
 to produce energy from these magnets e 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.950
 they never noticed it though 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.700
 we are going to do an experiment this evening 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.280
 build a real magnetic motor perhaps 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.240
 and I will try in this experiment to do 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.460
 rotate this magnet without sources 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.540
 external energy ie I will try to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 make a small magnetic motor 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.980
 perpetual, however, to be able to do so 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.620
 I must 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.670
 abandon my certainties I must 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.600
 turn into a strange scientist 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.260
 maybe alternative more with the hood e 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.030
 to make this magnificent engine 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.030
 let's get to work 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 I will try to build this little one 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.310
 magnetic motor using 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 exclusively of objects that everyone 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.430
 you can find at home or in 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 stationery you see little gods 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.670
 these magnets are used for blackboards 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.860
 metallic or white we have the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.260
 pins for the blackboards I will take 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.739
 we have a piece of plastic but with the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.440
 peculiarity of having corners here 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.780
 of the slots for screws 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.209
 in this case we will be there for you 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.370
 pins and then we have our magneto 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.370
 and very very powerful we see here 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.460
 let's start by placing colored media 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.760
 here is the red the colors are very 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.460
 important because this is about 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.110
 alternative energies therefore not colors 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.420
 let's say secondary here we should 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.310
 this reads very well let's hope it is 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.190
 enough 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:46.010
 now that we are in support of 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:51.300
 plastic here it seems that makes it now 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:54.870
 that we are the magnets and await a 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:59.010
 moment at this point it should be created 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.690
 a new form of energy 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.650
 here should circulate to support 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.650
 this magnet 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.579
 and now all that remains is to rotate the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.510
 magnet is a key moment in the 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.510
 history of humanity 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:31.720
 here is voting is rotating without 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:38.620
 external energy sources is not only 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:44.310
 suspended and suspended from the ground thanks thanks 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 to the energy of these small magnets 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.620
 very cheap you can build from 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.150
 just this machine 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.979
 imagine this machine thousands of 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.090
 times bigger could solve i 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:01.449
 energy problems of all humanity 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.430
 if you believe this, take the address 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.760
 of the video spread it to all yours 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.680
 friends and you look at them this person 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.120
 has solved energy problems 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.210
 mankind 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.370
 if instead you want to check 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.860
 I could answer you then have you want 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.949
 check but this machine in 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.810
 secret to protected then make me out 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:33.360
 of the mysterious things that you don't 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:36.099
 you might be able to understand and dangerous 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.400
 but if you give me an advance I will 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:44.710
 I build a vein of deliveries in a few 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:49.330
 month I do you a favor truth in 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:52.360
 next video I will disassemble this 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.630
 small device I'll show you why 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.240
 is rotating 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.240
 and if it is true that not to energy sources 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.240
 external
