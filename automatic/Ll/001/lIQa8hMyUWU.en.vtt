00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.350
 every garden video point comes my name 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.629
 Markus is planing behind the camera 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 the camera of the loan specialist and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.889
 peter haslhofer breeds here 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.049
 a pot bucket there pot ever there 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 more people want it in the pot 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
 cultivate the gardens become small 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.310
 Terrace balconies become important 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.769
 You have to pay attention if you have one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 top because all pull like widmann pulls that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.490
 you use what kind of a young plant 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 what kind of substrate is it? 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.840
 pot size peter can us and ours 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.450
 spectators and help a bit 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.910
 as I said, he cuts in the spring 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 cuttings this is now one 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.790
 We do not have a young plant anymore 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.440
 planted 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.879
 we need them to top tubers 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.890
 productions and here 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 You can see the pot pay here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 the tubers already in it 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.309
 Here the plant has been placed 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.210
 So it is for us to sometimes still 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.289
 testify now after the fourth 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.789
 drive out so to speak or after the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.980
 sixth between fourth and sixth 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.830
 Exhaustion is implied then arises 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.619
 the young plant she stood here very much 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.479
 still a beautiful young plant 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.860
 Now and then they came to plant 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.409
 When was the right season? 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
 to become the plants normally 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.210
 These loans are available from us at the beginning of May 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.850
 planted out depending on the situation 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 they are how long it freezes after the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.509
 Last earliest we planted myself 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.210
 would say on average about the tenth 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.909
 because at the beginning of may behind my and the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.920
 then one uses and baptizes him to one 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.600
 pot how big must the pot at least 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.110
 So let me say to these 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.049
 varieties that we have here mainly 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 Target liter pots are then taken 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.299
 ten to the very high grades 15 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.490
 liter should then develop the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.380
 Italy splendid and the ratio 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 still fits the loan should then 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.220
 also not in a coaster stand 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.439
 so that the tubers do not fall very much 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 importantly do not loan in coasters 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.520
 stand there with the water or the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.170
 thus coaster educate all 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 tubers or dahlia root not in the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.960
 water stand 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.909
 so the water does not like standing 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.009
 start to rot precisely control the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.929
 next is not desired italy and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.360
 also look that enough people downstairs 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.820
 to have 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.440
 just so that the water can drain 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.270
 so they do not stand in the water like that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.970
 with the pour like you with the stage 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.680
 yes , we have one here 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.260
 substrate uses phosphorus potassium 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.290
 stressed with long-term fertilizer for six 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.530
 months we have a ready mix in 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.000
 our case long-term fertilizer for six 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.340
 months is in the plants are 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.020
 were potted because they are from june 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.780
 We will have time for these big ones 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.820
 pots to cultivate me then 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.910
 need in august as a flowering commodity 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.830
 Here is a variety that is a little later 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.959
 probably planted a little later 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 and now blood is usually 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.430
 So start blooming in the beginning of august if 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.890
 someone now beginning of august to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.040
 potted plant with such a young plant 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.120
 when can he count on flowers? 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.910
 usually this plant will 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 planted at the beginning of may then i have the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.070
 The first flowers actually already at 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.350
 early varieties end june and there are 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.900
 early varieties and there are late varieties 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.480
 the larger the flowering the later will bloom 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.549
 that's it a rule of thumb yes okay 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.220
 and what substratum are you using there 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.130
 I have a finished earth here 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.680
 local stressed long-term fertilizer indoors 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.590
 for six months so the earth is 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.840
 actually a permeable substrate 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.180
 with additional sound of the water 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.250
 stores and what can people do now 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.110
 buy a pot plants earth one 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.970
 Potted plant closer potted plants 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.180
 potting soil with maybe something 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.489
 lava stone would be without further notice 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.500
 sufficient as in principle this 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.840
 he also potted plants for 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.880
 Citrus is offered as well 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.560
 normal balcony flowers would substrate 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.790
 without further for the italy for the 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.650
 There is still enough dahlia 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.600
 you have to take any cultural measures 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.900
 you have to pass again 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.340
 stabilize what is the what must the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.350
 hobby gardeners do when he his 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.269
 young plant stew so if I used to 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.640
 wants to bloom and most want to yes 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.590
 would blossom more as soon as possible 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.350
 I do not follow the plant builds 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.450
 Also already refer to us only 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.510
 so we have a simultaneous flowering 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.910
 so that the flowering is delayed a bit 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.260
 blossom that I have the environment we want 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.039
 Do not bloom all summer 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510
 cut out 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.380
 a bit of time in the summer should also 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.290
 we'll be that 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.360
 can also swim at the lake or so 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.810
 you can easily do the italy too 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.340
 sketch without gasoline sketch 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.500
 actually late the flowering time 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.070
 but then there is a uniform 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.420
 blossom 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.910
 So you could not, for example 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.350
 several bucket makes one happen 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.780
 the others did not happen with it 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.610
 you have a more permanent flowering in the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.400
 this is definitely a good one 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.350
 Idea as well may pour something else 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.240
 actually pour it to pour 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.010
 if italy in the pot 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.620
 you need a lot of water already 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.880
 much leaf mass needs a lot of leaf mass 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.030
 of course also a lot of water 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.190
 but it is sufficient for the Italy once 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.380
 to pour down properly so down in 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.480
 pour in the pot once properly 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.280
 Water is better than always 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.260
 bit to water fungal diseases 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.540
 can multiply if you can 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.180
 pour in the evening so pour in the morning and 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.400
 maybe one last pour 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.320
 the exposition people ask in the sun 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.730
 shadow shade what is possible 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.330
 what is advised 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:27.100
 yes it is so dahlien we love you there 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.410
 from mexico come in any case full 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.600
 they can tolerate a lot of heat without heat 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.330
 further, if you have enough west but 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.430
 do not plant under trees are Italy 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.320
 really so and sun lovers and 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.570
 light hungry just like us too 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.430
 this beautiful sunday morning 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.430
 thank you very much peter auslaufe thank you
