00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
sit there and snipe this is combat

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.269 
sit there and snipe this is combat
training<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.439> they<00:00:19.590> don't<00:00:19.740> actually<00:00:19.830> run<00:00:20.039> here

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
training so they don't actually run here

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.769 
training so they don't actually run here
but<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> an<00:00:20.820> online<00:00:20.939> clip<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.449> got<00:00:21.600> see

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
but this is an online clip I got see

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.970 
but this is an online clip I got see
they'll<00:00:21.930> run<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.590> would<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
they'll run that and that would be a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.140 
they'll run that and that would be a
clip<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.279> any<00:00:23.400> other<00:00:23.519> game<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
clip in any other game because it was a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.640 
clip in any other game because it was a
multi<00:00:24.449> kill<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.080> would<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.289> been<00:00:25.320> able<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
multi kill but would have been able to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.740 
multi kill but would have been able to
kill<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.340> game<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.880> proper<00:00:27.240> quad<00:00:27.480> feeds

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
kill this game to have proper quad feeds

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.650 
kill this game to have proper quad feeds
which<00:00:28.410> sucks<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.070> raid<00:00:29.279> spawn<00:00:29.699> trap<00:00:29.970> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
which sucks this is raid spawn trap you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.190 
which sucks this is raid spawn trap you
need<00:00:30.840> B<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.109> C<00:00:31.260> enemies<00:00:31.949> need<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:33.020> basically<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
need B and C enemies need a basically to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.740 
need B and C enemies need a basically to
sit<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:35.130> reverse<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.850> work<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sit here the reverse can work and I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
sit here the reverse can work and I
don't<00:00:36.930> show<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:39.000> good

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
don't show it but it's not as good

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.459 
don't show it but it's not as good
because<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.510> don't<00:00:39.629> line<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.140> well<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
because they don't line up as well but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
because they don't line up as well but
you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.430> feeds<00:00:41.940> down<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> stairs

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you can get my feeds down the stairs

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.619 
you can get my feeds down the stairs
which<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> pretty<00:00:43.980> good<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
which is pretty good and you know I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.110 
which is pretty good and you know I
recommend<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.649> mostly<00:00:47.309> spawn<00:00:47.700> traps<00:00:47.969> where

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
recommend for mostly spawn traps where

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
recommend for mostly spawn traps where
you<00:00:48.239> shoot<00:00:48.420> quick<00:00:48.660> DSR<00:00:50.629> or<00:00:51.739> no<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.860> deer

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you shoot quick DSR or no not deer

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.650 
you shoot quick DSR or no not deer
sorcery<00:00:53.430> whether<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.180> one<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:55.190> done<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> is

isn't<00:03:06.080> combat<00:03:06.440> running<00:03:06.710> so<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.460> know<00:03:07.580> it's

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
isn't combat running so you know it's

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.420 
isn't combat running so you know it's
not<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.940> easiest<00:03:08.710> bin<00:03:09.710> away<00:03:09.950> there's<00:03:10.250> lots<00:03:10.370> of

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
not the easiest bin away there's lots of

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.240 
not the easiest bin away there's lots of
enemies<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:12.440> also<00:03:12.650> complete<00:03:12.980> my<00:03:13.100> own

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
enemies and this also complete my own

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.600 
enemies and this also complete my own
for<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:13.520> one<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.270> spawned<00:03:14.630> some<00:03:14.900> BOTS

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
for this one I just spawned some BOTS

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.250 
for this one I just spawned some BOTS
there's<00:03:16.610> only<00:03:16.730> nuke<00:03:16.970> town<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.450> yeah<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.140> this

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
there's only nuke town so yeah and this

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.150 
there's only nuke town so yeah and this
is<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> third<00:03:18.830> round

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
is the third round

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.800 
is the third round
you<00:03:19.310> can't<00:03:19.550> over<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.970> over<00:03:20.330> time<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.630> from

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
you can't over to over time you from

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.110 
you can't over to over time you from
this<00:03:20.930> side<00:03:20.990> is<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.320> best<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:22.010> because<00:03:22.580> it<00:03:22.730> but

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
this side is the best but because it but

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.100 
this side is the best but because it but
the<00:03:23.180> other<00:03:23.300> side<00:03:23.420> works<00:03:23.600> well<00:03:23.810> there's<00:03:24.020> only

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
the other side works well there's only

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.630 
the other side works well there's only
one<00:03:24.230> bomb<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.950> it's<00:03:25.070> right<00:03:25.220> there<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.610> that

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
one bomb and it's right there so that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.860 
one bomb and it's right there so that
you<00:03:25.790> will<00:03:25.850> try<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.120> run<00:03:26.270> towards<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.720> and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
you will try and run towards it and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.570 
you will try and run towards it and
there's<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.170> great<00:03:27.530> quad<00:03:27.860> lineup<00:03:28.250> if<00:03:28.430> they

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.050 
from the middle where same spawn trap Oh
everyone's<00:04:35.710> got<00:04:35.860> clips<00:04:36.069> on<00:04:36.190> this<00:04:36.310> map<00:04:36.490> even

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
everyone's got clips on this map even

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.830 
everyone's got clips on this map even
I've<00:04:37.270> got<00:04:37.300> one<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:39.009> yeah<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.330> reverse<00:04:40.660> you

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
I've got one so yeah and the reverse you

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.270 
I've got one so yeah and the reverse you
can<00:04:40.870> spawn<00:04:41.289> trap<00:04:41.560> at<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.680> other<00:04:41.860> side<00:04:42.039> but

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
can spawn trap at the other side but

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.309 
can spawn trap at the other side but
it's<00:04:42.400> really<00:04:42.550> not<00:04:42.729> as<00:04:42.849> good<00:04:42.990> because<00:04:43.990> they

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
it's really not as good because they

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.990 
it's really not as good because they
don't<00:04:44.500> all<00:04:44.620> spawn<00:04:44.919> at<00:04:45.039> one<00:04:45.190> side<00:04:45.460> what<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.880> do

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
don't all spawn at one side what you do

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.670 
don't all spawn at one side what you do
get<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.240> off<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.750> can<00:04:46.900> shoot<00:04:47.080> some<00:04:47.289> people

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
get is off and you can shoot some people

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.589 
get is off and you can shoot some people
one<00:04:48.310> way<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.759> then<00:04:48.849> you<00:04:48.940> look<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.360> spawn

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
one way and then you look to the spawn

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.059 
one way and then you look to the spawn
trap<00:04:49.900> parts<00:04:50.259> down<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.590> left<00:04:50.770> or<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:50.979> right

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
trap parts down the left or the right

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.950 
trap parts down the left or the right
and<00:04:51.250> get<00:04:51.520> like<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.669> clout<00:04:52.000> or<00:04:52.180> triple<00:04:52.569> for<00:04:52.930> a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
and get like a clout or triple for a

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.559 
and get like a clout or triple for a
nice<00:04:53.110> feed<00:04:53.560> this<00:04:54.069> is<00:04:54.220> Kirk's<00:04:54.490> clip<00:04:54.849> just<00:04:55.360> put

nice feed this is Kirk's clip just put
this<00:04:55.659> in<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:58.690> think<00:04:58.990> it's<00:04:59.169> not<00:04:59.380> quite<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> few

kills with the whatever it is and this

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.469 
kills with the whatever it is and this
is<00:05:02.169> what's<00:05:03.039> it's<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.090> actor<00:05:04.300> or<00:05:04.449> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
aircraft carrier on this is demo when I

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.510 
aircraft carrier on this is demo when I
was<00:05:08.229> playing<00:05:08.380> online<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.680> got<00:05:08.949> a<00:05:08.979> great<00:05:09.250> sponsor

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
was playing online I got a great sponsor

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.740 
was playing online I got a great sponsor
up<00:05:09.789> here<00:05:10.000> and<00:05:10.180> they<00:05:10.240> always<00:05:10.479> thought<00:05:10.599> it's

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
up here and they always thought it's

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.050 
up here and they always thought it's
born<00:05:10.990> in<00:05:11.080> behind<00:05:11.319> there<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.800> didn't<00:05:12.610> get<00:05:12.729> well

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
born in behind there I didn't get well

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.730 
born in behind there I didn't get well
there's<00:05:13.419> quite<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:13.569> few<00:05:13.630> pointing<00:05:14.050> that<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.349> I

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
there's quite a few pointing that and I

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.309 
there's quite a few pointing that and I
can<00:05:15.039> show<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.430> well<00:05:15.610> in<00:05:15.819> this<00:05:16.319> because

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
can show it that well in this because

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.409 
can show it that well in this because
there<00:05:17.500> were<00:05:17.560> loads<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.770> enemies<00:05:18.130> like<00:05:19.120> I

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
there were loads of enemies like I

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.210 
there were loads of enemies like I
didn't<00:05:19.810> actually<00:05:19.960> try<00:05:20.289> it<00:05:20.409> that<00:05:20.620> much<00:05:20.830> my

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
didn't actually try it that much my

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.469 
didn't actually try it that much my
apologies<00:05:21.639> I<00:05:21.759> just<00:05:21.880> wanted<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.150> get<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:22.360> out

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
apologies I just wanted to get this out

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.300 
apologies I just wanted to get this out
the<00:05:22.570> way<00:05:22.599> I<00:05:22.690> didn't<00:05:22.990> want<00:05:23.139> to<00:05:23.229> do<00:05:23.349> this<00:05:23.530> that

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
the way I didn't want to do this that

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.909 
the way I didn't want to do this that
much<00:05:24.430> getting<00:05:25.240> late<00:05:25.479> like<00:05:25.840> 11<00:05:26.500> o'clock<00:05:26.650> now

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
much getting late like 11 o'clock now

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.879 
much getting late like 11 o'clock now
but<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:28.960> showing<00:05:29.289> the<00:05:29.349> spawn<00:05:29.560> trap<00:05:29.740> for

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
but this is showing the spawn trap for

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:30.959 
but this is showing the spawn trap for
somewhere<00:05:30.070> else<00:05:30.159> basically<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.729> want<00:05:30.909> to

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
somewhere else basically just want to

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.459 
somewhere else basically just want to
destroy<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.449> bean<00:05:31.630> bomb<00:05:31.900> that's<00:05:32.199> what<00:05:32.349> I<00:05:32.380> was

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
destroy the bean bomb that's what I was

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.920 
destroy the bean bomb that's what I was
showing<00:05:32.620> before<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:34.270> but<00:05:34.719> the<00:05:34.780> problem

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
showing before and this but the problem

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.659 
showing before and this but the problem
is<00:05:35.080> they<00:05:35.199> spawn<00:05:35.440> down<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.889> little<00:05:36.039> bit<00:05:36.310> here<00:05:36.550> on

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
is they spawn down a little bit here on

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.790 
is they spawn down a little bit here on
the<00:05:36.909> left<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.479> that<00:05:38.110> they<00:05:38.320> can't<00:05:38.560> continue

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
the left and that they can't continue

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.290 
the left and that they can't continue
spawning<00:05:39.130> now<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:39.580> they<00:05:39.849> either<00:05:40.000> come<00:05:40.270> out

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
spawning now and they either come out

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.570 
spawning now and they either come out
this<00:05:40.509> side<00:05:40.719> or<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:41.020> other<00:05:41.050> side<00:05:41.430> when<00:05:42.430> you're

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
this side or the other side when you're

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.249 
this side or the other side when you're
spawning<00:05:42.820> like<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.120> fast<00:05:43.389> when<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.870> had<00:05:44.110> this

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
spawning like the fast when I had this

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.020 
spawning like the fast when I had this
one<00:05:44.409> we're<00:05:45.190> showing<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.490> spawn<00:05:45.699> trap<00:05:45.880> from

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
one we're showing the spawn trap from

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.930 
one we're showing the spawn trap from
the<00:05:46.180> other<00:05:46.300> angle<00:05:46.479> so<00:05:47.139> it's<00:05:47.259> not<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.530> good

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
the other angle so it's not that good

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.640 
the other angle so it's not that good
but<00:05:49.509> you<00:05:49.599> can<00:05:49.719> probably<00:05:49.900> get<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.139> spawn<00:05:50.380> trap<00:05:50.560> to

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
but you can probably get a spawn trap to

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.350 
but you can probably get a spawn trap to
work<00:05:50.800> quite<00:05:51.039> well<00:05:51.069> so<00:05:51.880> I'm<00:05:51.940> just<00:05:52.060> showing<00:05:52.270> you

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
work quite well so I'm just showing you

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.870 
work quite well so I'm just showing you
that<00:05:52.569> you<00:05:52.630> can<00:05:52.750> spawn<00:05:53.169> trapping<00:05:53.409> there<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.310> if

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
that you can spawn trapping there and if

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
that you can spawn trapping there and if
you<00:05:54.940> have<00:05:55.060> teammates<00:05:55.300> blocking<00:05:55.690> off<00:05:55.780> the

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
you have teammates blocking off the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.270 
you have teammates blocking off the
spawn<00:05:56.110> I'm<00:05:56.229> pretty<00:05:56.560> sure<00:05:56.710> you<00:05:56.830> can<00:05:56.979> get<00:05:57.099> it<00:05:57.190> to

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
spawn I'm pretty sure you can get it to

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.559 
spawn I'm pretty sure you can get it to
work<00:05:57.370> well<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.729> didn't<00:05:57.940> really<00:05:58.090> try<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:58.449> much

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
work well I didn't really try that much

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.300 
work well I didn't really try that much
because<00:05:58.930> everyone's<00:05:59.289> clean<00:05:59.680> swarms<00:06:00.219> and

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
because everyone's clean swarms and

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.110 
because everyone's clean swarms and
stuff<00:06:00.819> that<00:06:01.120> I<00:06:01.150> was<00:06:01.360> playing<00:06:01.599> with<00:06:01.659> what<00:06:02.530> noobs

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120
