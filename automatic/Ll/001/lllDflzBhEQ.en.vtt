00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.720
 and if we did a little simple recipe know what kind of thing to 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.719
 boycott any paris corrects brand new score 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.269
 indeed spent all night aden in the water as his rival it is necessary 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.150
 say it the site 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.679
 and then in vain to heat a few minutes 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.039
 Yes 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.399
 alain I bought an hour later not far from here 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.360
 I'm later from his unique design have been for his compressed and that's 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.000
 give this kind of plate 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
 and there is also the portrait know that a deep taste thomas who does not like the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.250
 all 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.450
 it is nevertheless the first time that I listened it to me immediately liked 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.710
 I'm not going to a second flavor coloring 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 a kind of detective 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.770
 bruno martinez in a corner of his head and divest 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.630
 it's so much stops without this year to give heart to heart when 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.170
 of an 11th district they are always 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.450
 eyi since that time I love botargo 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.879
 and a year ago one of the best ways of the alternative 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.860
 it's not only a pass quality but this one with these beans 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.210
 and there we will see if there is some kind of plan and biblical 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.730
 but if we are happy now they are young shoots 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.710
 no but I wanted to prepare all this for a great 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.350
 that sent me 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.990
 to a mory friend who takes himself for what he is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.870
 and it's the product it's a lifta the empty chair in the tuscan and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.940
 then it's a wonderfully strong oil 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.710
 it's kind of a kind of violence killings it's not credible she 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.920
 is able to lift a case like this she is able to carry 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.170
 the company 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.070
 and you will see if that kind of complaints that we taste 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.540
 the time to silently savor why because the purpose is 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.640
 pretty pretty staggering and mostly it's raw 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 and I love that kind of fun plan to do 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.520
 we do not care if he gets the best refund after his 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.789
 arrival
