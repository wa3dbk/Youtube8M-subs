00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to zoom out just a skosh you can see

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030

he's<00:01:24.780> got<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.290> nice<00:01:25.470> wingspan

he's got a very nice wingspan
considering<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> hiccup<00:01:28.259> next<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> him

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
considering this is a hiccup next to him

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.130 
considering this is a hiccup next to him
and<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.540> standard<00:01:30.720> figure<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and this is just the standard figure I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.330 
and this is just the standard figure I
imagine<00:01:31.470> they'll<00:01:31.560> probably<00:01:31.829> release<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
imagine they'll probably release a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
imagine they'll probably release a
larger<00:01:32.729> one<00:01:32.850> later<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> line<00:01:33.390> too<00:01:34.159> but

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
larger one later down the line too but

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
larger one later down the line too but
yeah<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.640> probably<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.299> 14<00:01:36.869> inch

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
yeah this is probably like a 14 inch

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.350 
yeah this is probably like a 14 inch
wingspan<00:01:37.259> maybe<00:01:37.920> 13<00:01:38.310> inch<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:39.090> very

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
wingspan maybe 13 inch but very very

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.020 
wingspan maybe 13 inch but very very
large<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.250> cool<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.610> really

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
large so really really cool I really

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.550 
large so really really cool I really
like<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:43.229> big<00:01:43.799> this<00:01:43.979> guy<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:46.079> bottom<00:01:46.380> he's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
like how big this guy is the bottom he's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
like how big this guy is the bottom he's
got<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> texture<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
got kind of a little bit of a texture to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.020 
got kind of a little bit of a texture to
his<00:01:48.960> belly<00:01:49.280> definitely<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.430> scaling<00:01:50.820> here

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
his belly definitely some scaling here

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.710 
his belly definitely some scaling here
on<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> tail<00:01:52.470> fin<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.950> everything<00:01:53.420> very<00:01:54.420> cool

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
on the tail fin and everything very cool

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.929 
on the tail fin and everything very cool
though<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.229> said<00:01:55.409> no<00:01:55.560> articulation<00:01:56.369> in

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
though like I said no articulation in

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.209 
though like I said no articulation in
the<00:01:57.060> jaw<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.320> legs<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.740> anything<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.159> we

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the jaw or the legs or anything but we

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.249 
the jaw or the legs or anything but we
do<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> wings<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.140> get

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
do get it in the wings and you do get

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.270 
do get it in the wings and you do get
rotation<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.700> head<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> that's<00:02:04.280> pretty

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
rotation in the head so that's pretty

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.039 
rotation in the head so that's pretty
much<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.850> far<00:02:06.090> as<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.360> looks<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
much it as far as like looks go and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
much it as far as like looks go and
everything<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.649> articulation<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.429> pretty

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
everything and articulation is pretty

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.029 
everything and articulation is pretty
limited<00:02:08.849> he<00:02:09.750> will<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.020> able<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.440> sit<00:02:10.830> down<00:02:10.979> on

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
limited he will be able to sit down on

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.770 
limited he will be able to sit down on
the<00:02:11.190> ground<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.580> everything<00:02:11.780> unfortunately

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the ground and everything unfortunately

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.610 
the ground and everything unfortunately
if<00:02:12.840> his<00:02:12.959> wings<00:02:13.170> are<00:02:13.290> bad

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
if his wings are bad

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.949 
if his wings are bad
he<00:02:14.040> does<00:02:14.220> get<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:14.430> back<00:02:14.760> heavy<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.360> he<00:02:15.780> does

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
he does get very back heavy and he does

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.530 
he does get very back heavy and he does
that<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.129> that's<00:02:17.400> too<00:02:17.580> bad<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.269> start

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that so that's too bad but as you start

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.180 
that so that's too bad but as you start
to<00:02:18.629> kind<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.930> open<00:02:19.049> them<00:02:19.319> up<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.709> bit<00:02:19.980> he

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
to kind of open them up a little bit he

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
to kind of open them up a little bit he
starts<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.640> balance<00:02:21.450> out<00:02:21.569> his<00:02:21.690> weight<00:02:21.900> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
starts to balance out his weight a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.720 
starts to balance out his weight a
little<00:02:22.170> bit<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.500> better<00:02:22.769> you<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.400> still<00:02:23.610> kind

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
little bit but better you do still kind

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.070 
little bit but better you do still kind
of<00:02:23.760> tap<00:02:24.000> him<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.330> he'll<00:02:24.420> fall<00:02:24.599> back<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.019> if

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
of tap him and he'll fall back but if

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.449 
of tap him and he'll fall back but if
you<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.319> him<00:02:25.409> all<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.680> way<00:02:25.830> opened<00:02:26.190> out<00:02:26.310> to

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
you get him all the way opened out to

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.000 
you get him all the way opened out to
the<00:02:26.549> side<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.420> his<00:02:27.930> weight<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.620> pretty<00:02:28.860> well

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the side then his weight is pretty well

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
the side then his weight is pretty well
balanced<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.400> he<00:02:29.519> doesn't<00:02:29.670> go<00:02:29.819> anywhere<00:02:30.470> so

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
balanced and he doesn't go anywhere so

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.640 
balanced and he doesn't go anywhere so
pretty<00:02:31.709> cool<00:02:31.890> pretty<00:02:32.159> cool<00:02:33.440> now<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.530> big

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
pretty cool pretty cool now the big

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.470 
pretty cool pretty cool now the big
thing<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.190> line<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.670> their<00:02:35.909> action

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
thing about this line is their action

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.660 
thing about this line is their action
features<00:02:36.780> pull<00:02:37.769> back<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.159> little<00:02:38.489> button

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
features pull back on that little button

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.190 
features pull back on that little button
that<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:38.940> showed<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.019> just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
that I showed you and then you just

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.009 
that I showed you and then you just
start<00:02:40.349> rotating<00:02:40.650> him<00:02:41.159> around<00:02:41.569> however<00:02:42.569> much

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
start rotating him around however much

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.680 
start rotating him around however much
you<00:02:43.200> want<00:02:43.230> him<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.860> barrel<00:02:44.159> roll<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.269> do<00:02:45.569> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
you want him to barrel roll so you do it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.569 
you want him to barrel roll so you do it
once<00:02:45.870> like<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:47.099> then<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.370> sort<00:02:47.519> of

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
once like that and then it's sort of

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.400 
once like that and then it's sort of
locked<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:47.970> place<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.200> pull

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
locked in place and then you just pull

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.910 
locked in place and then you just pull
your<00:02:49.530> little<00:02:49.709> button<00:02:49.980> here<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.739> he<00:02:52.739> does<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
your little button here and he does a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.009 
your little button here and he does a
full<00:02:53.129> barrel<00:02:53.430> roll<00:02:53.609> now<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.840> want

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
full barrel roll now that's if you want

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.479 
full barrel roll now that's if you want
to<00:02:55.109> go<00:02:55.200> simple<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> can

to go simple if you want to you can
continue<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.209> spend<00:02:57.420> this<00:02:57.569> guy<00:02:57.750> around<00:02:58.109> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
continue to spend this guy around and

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.180 
continue to spend this guy around and
get<00:02:59.159> several<00:02:59.459> spins<00:02:59.909> on<00:03:00.120> him<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.560> far<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:01.890> kept

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
get several spins on him so far I kept

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.649 
get several spins on him so far I kept
spinning<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.700> haven't<00:03:02.970> had<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.180> locked<00:03:03.359> yet

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
spinning and I haven't had it locked yet

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.330 
spinning and I haven't had it locked yet
but<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:04.590> pull<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.859> button<00:03:05.129> and

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
but then you can pull the button and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.210 
but then you can pull the button and
it's<00:03:05.459> much<00:03:05.609> tighter<00:03:05.909> and<00:03:06.090> it'll<00:03:06.269> spin<00:03:06.450> faster

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
it's much tighter and it'll spin faster

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.009 
it's much tighter and it'll spin faster
and<00:03:08.220> he'll<00:03:08.549> get<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.700> lot<00:03:08.879> more<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.180> action<00:03:09.930> out

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
and he'll get a lot more of action out

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.270 
and he'll get a lot more of action out
of<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.349> very<00:03:10.530> cool

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
them individually like they did with the

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.170 
them individually like they did with the
defenders<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.810> Burke's<00:03:40.139> figures<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:42.060> can

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
defenders of Burke's figures but you can

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.990 
defenders of Burke's figures but you can

see he's got his little peg hole here

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.220 
see he's got his little peg hole here
this<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.269> not<00:03:45.389> included<00:03:45.720> with<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.900> dragon

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
this is not included with the dragon

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.990 
this is not included with the dragon
this<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.349> separate<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.010> basically<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:47.970> just

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
this is separate so basically you just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.699 
this is separate so basically you just
got<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.329> figure<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.750> or<00:03:49.169> at<00:03:49.260> least<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.680> to

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
got to figure out or at least I have to

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.470 
got to figure out or at least I have to
figure<00:03:49.949> out<00:03:50.069> how<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.489> fits<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:51.060> here<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.269> guess

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
figure out how this fits on here I guess

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.720 
figure out how this fits on here I guess
kind<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:54.359> then<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.609> get<00:03:56.609> them

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
kind of like that and then you get them

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.909 
kind of like that and then you get them
all<00:03:56.879> splayed<00:03:57.180> open<00:03:57.470> lock<00:03:58.470> him<00:03:58.620> down<00:03:58.650> on<00:03:58.889> the

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
all splayed open lock him down on the

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:06.650 
all splayed open lock him down on the
dragon<00:03:59.340> and<00:04:04.609> kind<00:04:05.609> of<00:04:05.730> locked<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.419> then<00:04:06.569> you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
dragon and kind of locked and then you

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.750 
dragon and kind of locked and then you
just<00:04:06.810> kind<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.620> curve<00:04:07.949> his<00:04:08.160> legs<00:04:08.459> around

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
just kind of curve his legs around

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.530 
just kind of curve his legs around
toothless<00:04:09.629> is<00:04:09.780> neck<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:12.060> once<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.389> actually

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
toothless is neck so once you actually

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.909 
toothless is neck so once you actually
get<00:04:12.750> him<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:12.989> here<00:04:13.169> like<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.500> he<00:04:13.799> actually

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
get him on here like this he actually

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.159 
get him on here like this he actually
seems<00:04:14.310> kind<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.609> big<00:04:14.819> for<00:04:15.120> toothless<00:04:15.480> he

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
seems kind of big for toothless he

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.170 
seems kind of big for toothless he
should<00:04:16.380> be<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.530> lot<00:04:16.769> smaller<00:04:17.099> but<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:17.880> know

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.350 
at TR use of the price may be inflated a
little<00:04:58.180> bit<00:04:58.330> but<00:04:58.900> 15<00:04:59.500> bucks<00:04:59.710> isn't<00:05:00.160> too<00:05:00.460> bad<00:05:00.700> I

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
little bit but 15 bucks isn't too bad I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.230 
little bit but 15 bucks isn't too bad I
think<00:05:01.900> 13<00:05:02.230> probably<00:05:02.590> would<00:05:02.710> be<00:05:02.830> closer<00:05:03.240> just

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
think 13 probably would be closer just

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.110 
think 13 probably would be closer just
considering<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.860> he<00:05:06.370> doesn't<00:05:06.640> have<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.790> ton

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
considering that he doesn't have a ton

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.310 
considering that he doesn't have a ton
of<00:05:07.150> action<00:05:07.420> features<00:05:07.870> or<00:05:07.990> anything<00:05:08.200> he's<00:05:08.290> just

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
of action features or anything he's just

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.010 
of action features or anything he's just
got<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.590> one<00:05:09.070> and<00:05:09.370> he's<00:05:10.240> not<00:05:10.420> as<00:05:10.540> big<00:05:10.750> as<00:05:10.870> he

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
got that one and he's not as big as he

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.900 
got that one and he's not as big as he
really<00:05:11.260> could<00:05:11.470> be<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.220> little<00:05:12.610> bit<00:05:12.790> of<00:05:12.850> a

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
really could be so a little bit of a

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.370 
really could be so a little bit of a
letdown<00:05:13.090> there<00:05:13.540> but<00:05:13.750> like<00:05:13.930> I<00:05:14.020> said<00:05:14.080> they'll

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
letdown there but like I said they'll

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.810 
letdown there but like I said they'll
probably<00:05:14.530> release<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.890> larger<00:05:15.220> version<00:05:15.490> later

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
probably release a larger version later

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.880 
probably release a larger version later
which<00:05:16.810> I'll<00:05:16.960> probably<00:05:17.170> end<00:05:17.410> up<00:05:17.560> buying<00:05:17.710> I

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
which I'll probably end up buying I

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.230 
which I'll probably end up buying I
really<00:05:18.250> think<00:05:18.430> I'm<00:05:18.490> gonna<00:05:18.610> love<00:05:18.760> this<00:05:18.940> movie<00:05:19.210> I

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
really think I'm gonna love this movie I

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.960 
really think I'm gonna love this movie I
love<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.600> first<00:05:19.810> one<00:05:19.990> so<00:05:20.230> very<00:05:20.440> excited<00:05:21.430> but

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
love the first one so very excited but

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.460 
love the first one so very excited but
that's<00:05:22.120> pretty<00:05:22.330> much<00:05:22.480> it<00:05:22.720> for<00:05:22.750> spin<00:05:23.200> masters

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
that's pretty much it for spin masters
