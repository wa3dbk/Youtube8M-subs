00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
I heard this one I also bought this cube

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.629 
I heard this one I also bought this cube
so<00:00:09.599> they<00:00:09.809> came<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.170> together<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:11.160> one<00:00:11.370> was

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
so they came here together this one was

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.990 
so they came here together this one was
also<00:00:11.670> wrapped<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> bubble<00:00:12.599> wrap<00:00:12.809> but<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.130> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
also wrapped in bubble wrap but and it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.300 
also wrapped in bubble wrap but and it
was<00:00:15.179> also<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.750> box<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.740> just

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
was also in this box here so it just

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.550 
was also in this box here so it just
wasn't<00:00:17.609> about<00:00:17.789> wrapped<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.840> bubble<00:00:18.990> wrap<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
wasn't about wrapped in bubble wrap and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.279 
wasn't about wrapped in bubble wrap and
that's<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.670> let's<00:00:20.939> move<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.330> move<00:00:22.140> this

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
that's it so let's move this move this

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.910 
that's it so let's move this move this
out<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.800> way<00:00:22.890> there<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.820> go<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.800> right<00:00:25.800> now

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
out of the way there we go and right now

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560 
out of the way there we go and right now
you're<00:00:26.130> saying<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.640> why<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.330> buy<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you're saying but why do you buy this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.560 
you're saying but why do you buy this
cube<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.560> already<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.670> well

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
cube if you already have this one well

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.170 
cube if you already have this one well
this<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.349> not<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> same<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.460> that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
this one is not the same thing as that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
this one is not the same thing as that
one<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:34.800> made

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
one so this one as you can see it's made

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.900 
one so this one as you can see it's made
by<00:00:35.130> rubik's<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.899> made<00:00:37.170> by<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
by rubik's and this one is made by I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.280 
by rubik's and this one is made by I
don't<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.030> why<00:00:39.149> don't<00:00:39.329> read<00:00:39.510> Japanese<00:00:40.020> or

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
don't know why don't read Japanese or

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.760 
don't know why don't read Japanese or
Chinese<00:00:40.340> but<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:42.329> cube<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.079> called<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> dayan

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
Chinese but this cube is called a dayan

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
Chinese but this cube is called a dayan
zhanchi<00:00:43.800> cube<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.420> pretty<00:00:45.870> much<00:00:46.050> same

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
zhanchi cube so it's pretty much same

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
zhanchi cube so it's pretty much same
thing<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.219> moved<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> same<00:00:47.850> way<00:00:48.120> nothing<00:00:48.899> new

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
thing it moved the same way nothing new

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.090 
thing it moved the same way nothing new
besides<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.940> quality<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.870> cube<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
besides the quality so this cube is a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.729 
besides the quality so this cube is a
lot<00:00:53.399> better<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> quality<00:00:54.570> than<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.440> one

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
lot better in the quality than this one

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.479 
lot better in the quality than this one
since<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.059> corner<00:00:57.570> cut<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:59.039> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
since you can corner cut a lot more so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.319 
since you can corner cut a lot more so
on<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.109> usual<00:01:01.109> cube<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on the usual cube you can go like this

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.929 
on the usual cube you can go like this
and<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:03.989> an<00:01:04.140> art<00:01:04.290> time<00:01:04.530> clue<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and you have an art time clue make it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.570 
and you have an art time clue make it
move<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.100> where<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.400> supposed

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
move and go back to where it's supposed

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.990 
move and go back to where it's supposed
to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.760> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to be but this one you can go like this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.350 
to be but this one you can go like this
it<00:01:12.630> works<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:14.030> as<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> can

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it works really really well as you can

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.060 
it works really really well as you can
see<00:01:15.600> like<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.909> first<00:01:17.909> pretty<00:01:18.750> well<00:01:18.960> even<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
see like that first pretty well even the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.940 
see like that first pretty well even the
other<00:01:20.250> side<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> force<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
other side you have to force it a bit it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.550 
other side you have to force it a bit it
will<00:01:23.250> turn<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.630> back<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.110> its<00:01:25.290> shape

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
will turn out to go back to its shape

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.359 
will turn out to go back to its shape
look<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.979> goes<00:01:29.159> back

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
look like this go up and then goes back

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.319 
look like this go up and then goes back
you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.150> even<00:01:30.299> go<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.909> go

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you can even go like that and just go

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
you can even go like that and just go
like<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.320> yeah<00:01:34.439> everything<00:01:34.950> works

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
like this and so yeah everything works

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.969 
like this and so yeah everything works
really<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.270> cube<00:01:36.680> it's<00:01:37.680> really

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
really well with this cube it's really

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.609 
really well with this cube it's really
where<00:01:38.310> rare<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.090> jams<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.020> cannot

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
where rare that it jams so you cannot

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.230 
where rare that it jams so you cannot
just<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.340> oh<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:41.850> aligned

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
just be like oh it's not aligned

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.630 
just be like oh it's not aligned
properly<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.170> cannot<00:01:43.470> move<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.890> since<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
properly and you cannot move it since it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.819 
properly and you cannot move it since it
just<00:01:44.850> Alliance<00:01:45.420> by<00:01:45.540> itself<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
just Alliance by itself so that's a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
just Alliance by itself so that's a
really<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.250> quality<00:01:47.729> cube<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.170> of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
really good quality cube right out of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
really good quality cube right out of
the<00:01:49.380> box<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.770> turned<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.340> well<00:01:50.610> once<00:01:51.479> again

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the box it turned really well once again

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080 
the box it turned really well once again
I<00:01:51.869> did<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> little<00:01:52.590> bit<00:01:52.680> yet<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> opened<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I did not a little bit yet I opened it

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.200 
I did not a little bit yet I opened it
once<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.140> saw<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.799> loop<00:01:56.430> inside<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.119> think

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
once and I saw a loop inside so i think

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.319 
once and I saw a loop inside so i think
the<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.100> send<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> me<00:01:59.700> lubed<00:02:00.149> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the the one that send it to me lubed it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.080 
the the one that send it to me lubed it
before<00:02:00.750> sending<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> me<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.070> yeah<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.729> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
before sending it to me so yeah it's it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
before sending it to me so yeah it's it
turns<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.509> well<00:02:03.630> already<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.590> i<00:02:04.619> bought<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
turns really well already so i bought a

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.040 
turns really well already so i bought a
little<00:02:05.070> bit<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.710> i'll<00:02:07.710> open<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.539> let

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
little bit so i'll open it just to let

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.630 
little bit so i'll open it just to let
you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.289> guys<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.770> different<00:02:11.160> inside

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you know guys out with different inside

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.770 
you know guys out with different inside
so<00:02:12.510> usually<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.230> cube

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so usually this cube

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.610 
so usually this cube
if<00:02:13.930> we<00:02:14.319> take<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:15.150> middle<00:02:16.150> piece<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.750> looks<00:02:16.810> like

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
if we take a middle piece it looks like

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.020 
if we take a middle piece it looks like
that<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.780> kind<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.380> triangle<00:02:20.950> shape<00:02:21.220> and

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
that so it kind of a triangle shape and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.500 
that so it kind of a triangle shape and
at<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.840> back<00:02:22.990> here<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.790> I'll<00:02:24.790> show<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:25.390> this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
at the back here and I'll show you this

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.220 
at the back here and I'll show you this
one<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.410> which<00:02:27.310> looks<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.670> bit<00:02:27.790> weirder<00:02:28.600> it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
one here which looks a bit weirder it's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.640 
one here which looks a bit weirder it's
pretty<00:02:29.500> weird<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.819> one<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
pretty weird so this one and this is the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.260 
pretty weird so this one and this is the
dayan<00:02:33.040> zhanchi<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:34.630> as<00:02:35.520> at<00:02:36.520> first<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.030> see

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
dayan zhanchi so as at first you see

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.260 
dayan zhanchi so as at first you see
it's<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.690> all<00:02:37.900> squared<00:02:38.860> there<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.940> few

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
it's not all squared there is a few

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.770 
it's not all squared there is a few
round<00:02:40.510> sides<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.739> here<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.060> top

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
round sides just like here and the top

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.030 
round sides just like here and the top
there<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.440> kind<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.900> zip<00:02:46.900> line<00:02:47.080> whatever

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
there is kind of a zip line whatever

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.479 
there is kind of a zip line whatever
looks<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.590> yeah<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.830> makes<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
looks like that and yeah that makes the

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.750 
looks like that and yeah that makes the
cube<00:02:51.760> move<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.239> lot<00:02:52.810> smoother<00:02:53.709> since<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.610> all

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
cube move a lot smoother since of all

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.449 
cube move a lot smoother since of all
all<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.300> these<00:02:55.480> rounded<00:02:55.989> edge<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.530> turns<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.310> lot

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
all of these rounded edge it turns a lot

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.570 
all of these rounded edge it turns a lot
better<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.350> that's<00:02:59.350> an<00:02:59.590> edge<00:02:59.769> piece<00:02:59.980> let's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
better and that's an edge piece let's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.990 
better and that's an edge piece let's
take<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.880> look<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.360> corners<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.890> under<00:03:03.610> you

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
take a look at the corners so under you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.809 
take a look at the corners so under you
normal<00:03:04.660> cube<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.350> get<00:03:05.730> actually<00:03:06.730> know

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
normal cube you just get actually know

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.640 
normal cube you just get actually know
that<00:03:06.850> that's<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> dayan<00:03:07.780> zhanchi<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.350> on<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
that that's the dayan zhanchi so on the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.300 
that that's the dayan zhanchi so on the
normal<00:03:08.950> cube<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.280> get<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.680> diamond

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
normal cube you get this kind of diamond

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.420 
normal cube you get this kind of diamond
shape<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.930> kind<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.410> corner<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.069> square

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
shape it's kind of a corner of a square

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.550 
shape it's kind of a corner of a square
so<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.880> get<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.239> shape<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.750> usual<00:03:17.260> cube

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
so you get that shape on the usual cube

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.430 
so you get that shape on the usual cube
and<00:03:17.769> then<00:03:18.430> dayan<00:03:19.030> zhanchi<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.570> get<00:03:19.780> this

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
and then dayan zhanchi you get this

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.520 
and then dayan zhanchi you get this
which<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:21.040> pretty<00:03:22.000> weird<00:03:22.450> as<00:03:22.840> soon<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.350> you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
which is pretty weird as soon as you

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.580 
which is pretty weird as soon as you
take<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.860> look<00:03:23.980> at<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:25.269> shapes<00:03:25.600> with<00:03:26.260> it's

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
take a look at it the shapes with it's

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.380 
take a look at it the shapes with it's
really<00:03:27.549> really<00:03:27.790> not<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.150> same<00:03:28.420> thing<00:03:28.810> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
really really not the same thing and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.090 
really really not the same thing and
like<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.540> once<00:03:31.810> again<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.230> lot<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.590> rounded<00:03:32.920> edge

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
like it once again a lot of rounded edge

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.930 
like it once again a lot of rounded edge
here<00:03:33.610> none<00:03:34.239> here<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:35.049> makes<00:03:35.260> everything

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
here none here that makes everything

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.690 
here none here that makes everything
seems<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.030> lot<00:03:37.180> smoother<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.709> overall<00:03:39.670> this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
seems a lot smoother so and overall this

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.660 
seems a lot smoother so and overall this
cube<00:03:40.450> here<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:41.019> lot<00:03:41.980> better<00:03:42.280> than<00:03:42.519> the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
cube here is a lot better than the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.830 
cube here is a lot better than the
normal<00:03:43.090> cube<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.500> turns<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.890> lot<00:03:45.070> better

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
normal cube and it turns a lot better

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.940 
normal cube and it turns a lot better
everything<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.790> better<00:03:48.790> I'd<00:03:49.150> say<00:03:49.390> I<00:03:49.690> just<00:03:50.500> keep

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
everything is better I'd say I just keep

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.170 
everything is better I'd say I just keep
saying<00:03:51.160> better<00:03:51.459> and<00:03:51.700> better<00:03:51.910> and<00:03:52.120> better

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
saying better and better and better

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.319 
saying better and better and better
that's<00:03:52.959> because<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.920> better<00:03:54.579> so<00:03:55.030> I'll

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
that's because it is better so I'll

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.539 
that's because it is better so I'll
leave<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> link<00:03:55.989> in<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.350> description<00:03:56.739> below<00:03:56.859> to

the page where I but this cube again the
same<00:04:00.519> website<00:04:00.970> as<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.420> other<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:02.290> a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
same website as the other one it's a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.690 
same website as the other one it's a
puzzle<00:04:03.269> khou.com<00:04:04.269> I<00:04:04.299> think<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.519> go<00:04:06.519> check<00:04:06.640> that

puzzle khou.com I think so go check that
out<00:04:06.880> it's<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.690> really<00:04:07.959> really<00:04:08.380> good<00:04:09.010> quality

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
out it's a really really good quality

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:14.310
