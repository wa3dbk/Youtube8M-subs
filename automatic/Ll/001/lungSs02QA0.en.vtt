00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
light shimmer and i'm just gonna apply

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.569 
light shimmer and i'm just gonna apply
that<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:53.750> outer<00:00:53.960> half<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.649> my<00:00:54.829> eyelid<00:00:55.309> and

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
that on the outer half of my eyelid and

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.570 
that on the outer half of my eyelid and
continue<00:00:56.149> to<00:00:56.270> build<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.539> color

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.310 

this<00:01:03.580> step<00:01:03.820> is<00:01:03.970> completely<00:01:04.540> optional<00:01:04.750> but<00:01:05.290> I

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
this step is completely optional but I

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.870 
this step is completely optional but I
think<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.710> tape<00:01:05.950> acts<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> really<00:01:06.760> good

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
think the tape acts is a really good

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.940 
think the tape acts is a really good
guideline<00:01:07.420> I'm<00:01:07.660> going<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.170> place<00:01:08.350> tape<00:01:08.650> on<00:01:08.860> the

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
guideline I'm going to place tape on the

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.590 
guideline I'm going to place tape on the
outer<00:01:09.100> corner<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.520> my<00:01:09.580> eyes<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.330> then<00:01:10.510> I'm

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
outer corner of my eyes and then I'm

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.050

gonna<00:01:10.720> pack<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.350> black<00:01:11.710> eyeshadow<00:01:12.010> onto<00:01:12.760> my

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
210 brush which i accidentally sat on

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
210 brush which i accidentally sat on
and<00:02:03.539> broke<00:02:03.750> i'm<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.530> apply<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.340> thin

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and broke i'm gonna apply a really thin

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.359 
and broke i'm gonna apply a really thin
line<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.420> gel<00:02:06.990> liner<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> my<00:02:07.679> upper<00:02:07.950> eyelid

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
line of gel liner on to my upper eyelid

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.219 
line of gel liner on to my upper eyelid
and<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:09.360> find<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:09.959> much

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and actually find that it's really much

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
and actually find that it's really much
easier<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.890> maneuver<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.370> brush<00:02:11.640> once<00:02:11.970> i

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
easier to maneuver this brush once i

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.309 
easier to maneuver this brush once i
broke<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.229

so now we're gonna go ahead and do a
really<00:02:20.299> tiny<00:02:20.780> way<00:02:21.019> my<00:02:22.269> goodness

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.900 

well<00:02:27.290> I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.040 

so<00:02:30.910> now<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> want<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.390> line<00:02:31.600> your<00:02:31.780> bottom

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
waterline with a black pencil eyeliner

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.270 
waterline with a black pencil eyeliner
and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:34.540> opted<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.410> pencil<00:02:35.770> eyeliner<00:02:36.100> as

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
and then opted for pencil eyeliner as

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.100 
and then opted for pencil eyeliner as
opposed<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.760> gel<00:02:37.000> liner<00:02:37.240> because<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.900> color

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
opposed to a gel liner because the color

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.990 
opposed to a gel liner because the color
payoff<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> bit<00:02:38.860> less<00:02:39.100> dramatic<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.820> bit

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
payoff is a bit less dramatic and a bit

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.730 
payoff is a bit less dramatic and a bit
