00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
a look like no other meaning that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
a look like no other meaning that
there's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> lot<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.439> volume<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
there's a lot of volume and a bit of

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
there's a lot of volume and a bit of
length<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.869> more<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.320> volume<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.040> crazy

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
length but more so volume it's crazy

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.679 
length but more so volume it's crazy
dark<00:01:42.270> intense<00:01:43.250> thick<00:01:44.250> volume<00:01:44.939> almost<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
dark intense thick volume almost like a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
dark intense thick volume almost like a
false<00:01:46.020> lash<00:01:46.500> effect<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
false lash effect so I really like this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.780 
false lash effect so I really like this
mascara<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:49.560> mascara<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.130> supposed<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> give

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
mascara this mascara is supposed to give

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.899 
mascara this mascara is supposed to give
this<00:01:50.850> similar<00:01:51.479> effect<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.909> separated

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this similar effect but more separated

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.319 
this similar effect but more separated
lashes<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.649> does<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.219> effect<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
lashes so it does do that effect but the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.280 
lashes so it does do that effect but the
point<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.750> lashes<00:02:00.960> are

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
point of this is that your lashes are

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.340 
point of this is that your lashes are
separate<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.659> little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.110> more

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
separate but like it's a little bit more

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.249 
separate but like it's a little bit more
clumpy<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.759> way<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.030> not<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.570> comfy<00:02:07.049> but

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
clumpy in a way but not really comfy but

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.639 
clumpy in a way but not really comfy but
it's<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:08.129> thick<00:02:08.819> mascara<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.720> gives<00:02:10.470> you

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it's just thick mascara that gives you

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.650 
it's just thick mascara that gives you

mascara<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.699> starting<00:03:53.790> out<00:03:54.120> of

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
mascara if you're just starting out of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.390 
mascara if you're just starting out of
mascara<00:03:54.629> super<00:03:55.169> cheap<00:03:55.379> and<00:03:55.590> it's<00:03:56.099> actually

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
mascara super cheap and it's actually

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.789 
mascara super cheap and it's actually
the<00:03:56.519> most<00:03:56.669> sold<00:03:56.970> mascara<00:03:57.389> ever<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.769> world

the most sold mascara ever in the world

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.050 
the most sold mascara ever in the world
so<00:03:59.509> it's<00:04:00.509> just<00:04:00.750> an<00:04:00.930> easy<00:04:01.290> usable<00:04:02.069> mascara<00:04:02.609> but

length<00:04:04.889> or<00:04:05.129> volume<00:04:05.579> so<00:04:05.909> it's<00:04:06.479> kind<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.840> a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930

purchase<00:06:28.479> so<00:06:28.659> I'm<00:06:28.900> kind<00:06:29.169> of<00:06:29.229> still<00:06:29.500> in<00:06:29.620> the

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
purchase so I'm kind of still in the

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.219 
purchase so I'm kind of still in the
phase<00:06:29.860> where<00:06:30.130> I'm<00:06:30.280> loving<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:30.729> but<00:06:31.060> it<00:06:31.900> was<00:06:32.199> a

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
phase where I'm loving this but it was a

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:33.629 
phase where I'm loving this but it was a
tough<00:06:32.530> call<00:06:32.740> between<00:06:32.860> this<00:06:33.159> and<00:06:33.219> the<00:06:33.460> lash
