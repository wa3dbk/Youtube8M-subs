and it's very interesting to watch the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639 
and it's very interesting to watch the
trade-off<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.080> it's<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> end<00:01:49.590> of

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
trade-off for that is it's the end of
