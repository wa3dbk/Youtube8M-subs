through<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> group<00:00:51.060> of<00:00:51.240> sand<00:00:51.510> grass<00:00:51.720> and<00:00:51.990> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
through this group of sand grass and I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
through this group of sand grass and I
was<00:00:53.190> quite<00:00:53.400> surprised<00:00:53.880> because<00:00:54.060> he<00:00:54.300> was<00:00:54.900> not

was quite surprised because he was not
at<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.800> interested<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.400> them<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.030> he<00:00:57.300> made

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
at all interested in them and he made

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.300 
at all interested in them and he made
this<00:00:57.570> beeline<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> water's<00:00:58.740> edge<00:00:58.950> and

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
this beeline for the water's edge and

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:10.380 
this beeline for the water's edge and
story<00:01:00.090> very<00:01:00.270> quickly<00:01:00.450> still<00:01:00.900> never<00:01:01.110> change
