00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 and people gave a break and let's think 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.210
 continuing here with the buzzer battery 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.039
 play this time I think only I wanted 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.599
 that I witnessed the game here 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.920
 naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 3 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.480
 ruberson the back testing it because by 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.610
 more that does not look like a game that weighs 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 A lot and I'm explaining it right. 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.199
 good to everyone finding play that is a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 nvidia program for recording it uses 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.360
 10% of your video card to record the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.129
 things and it is a program of high 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.829
 repercussion that seems to be a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.730
 success because of your things and everything 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.670
 more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.520
 And as it 's called in the last video to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.829
 me what the program needs to improve 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.199
 it would be a matter of dividing audios to divide 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.940
 with a microphone and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.539
 one to where the game for you power 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.180
 adjust everything else and change the 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.590
 quality for you to place other 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.729
 qualities defeated playing in full hd 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.250
 but I just want 20 720p change this myself 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.080
 I think these two changes would already 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.850
 much difference 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.689
 although the program is very good 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.750
 and I 'm using the msf bath for power 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.970
 It's showing the windows what the hell. 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.110
 which is pulling from every component everything 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.439
 more right 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:44.159
 Good, I'm using a computer with 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:47.790
 core i3 does not mean core i5 is 33 30 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.649
 I'm using a gtx 760 for this 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.310
 remembering that the shapley needs no 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.880
 gt 650 minimum 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.460
 well what I wanted to talk about from naruto to 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.050
 naruto he has got a light through graphic 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.540
 but it is not light 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.240
 when you put laise in full hd he 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.360
 Pulls a lot and you can see his chart. 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.370
 It seems light but this cartoon is this. 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.270
 dynamic that he who puts himself 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.740
 leaves the graphic very heavy particle 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.180
 things bursting etc. 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.400
 so much so that the games are good that I 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.410
 almost managed to get the most out of using 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.080
 my part of the video recording 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.670
 it has a 30 fps lock and one thing 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.560
 I wanted to be detailed about this 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 game is what I have to would be 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.830
 concern that it is a means of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.690
 an emulator because when you play a 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.000
 game and is not in the amount and faith 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.290
 He is happy to catch more naruto. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.540
 different happens 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.150
 It sits in slow motion when it's party. 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.340
 begins to fall in slow motion 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.180
 so much that anyone can play 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.060
 he slow-motion a good time there and that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.360
 that I just told you is something 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.769
 particular of emulators when the game 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.660
 is not holding it starts to rotate the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.989
 I play more in slow motion 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.780
 well, that's why I suppose so 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.640
 So much of this game was that it was brought 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.459
 with the pc and this is the first game of the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.820
 bug was bringing it to happen so it 's like this 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.709
 that the situation is now the second 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.600
 round will give you a better idea of ​​what 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.459
 there is something that I also 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.470
 I thought I'd pay attention to the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.540
 Naruto when he when I put 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.820
 excited and everything else was edges 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.010
 I found it very cool on the edges that 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.660
 they gave an anime tone in the game 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.610
 only that the more you increase the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.010
 anti resolution there these things seems 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.090
 that the flavor these borges get smaller 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.310
 so I think they should have 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.989
 increased the ball keeps that you can see 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.660
 which is smaller and a half that the game had 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.090
 a little of the one he made that anime 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.230
 has been so much that we received the game where 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.760
 simple anemia not cool 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.019
 and it looks healthy I'm using a date 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.989
 because because the mandate has an accent 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.260
 more elastic that exists and why 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.909
 participated in elastics that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.010
 You already assume that the bug will catch 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:16.229
 but it's good for now great x 11 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.239
 in this video that I did not like now I 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.299
 I think I have already gone from great 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.520
 so second is being naruto 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.500
 probably the third cd ball 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.330
 so you get queer to appear in 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 another is that the sequence also 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.780
 advanced but grew in consequence not 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.340
 will be swayed 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.430
 the next one the text will be read 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.350
 college and then start a 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.350
 heavier battery 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.780
 Well I had to download the audio from this 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.210
 because in relation to the microphone the 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.220
 my audi was very low 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.960
 and that's where that question comes in that I 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.520
 I said the settings could be 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.800
 changed you separate two tracks 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.099
 you can download the golden audio 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.310
 that's where it happens on the desktop I 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.500
 I used this program and it was in him that 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.820
 I saw this I thought it was very cool 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.270
 That's why I 've commented to 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.270
 you 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.170
 It hurts using everything that tends more pp than 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.830
 gives to use so you can see not okay 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.360
 pulling so much sometimes pulls but there 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.150
 it is also worth mentioning that 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.840
 open skype browser open one person 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.150
 using the computer can be said 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.980
 anyway it was all right recorded 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.050
 cool everything else to play it well more 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.050
 smooth and it was a good 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.830
 one thing I do not think I'm going to 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:53.240
 recording will be so deleted black flag 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:56.670
 because it is a very fourth-generation game 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.340
 and it is the game that most installed my pc 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:02.540
 in tauá even it's a game I saw 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.880
 more pulling a person off the beach 23 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.190
 but cruise 31 itself has arrived already 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.000
 It's recording, I believe. 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.230
 so if I recorded ukra 63 or not you 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.210
 go well after 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.030
 but I hope I have recorded 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.780
 three prisoners are only once you want 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.570
 tell me but I believe I'm going to record 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.960
 then he is nothing more independent as 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.780
 it affects the relationship already in election 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.190
 but then the staff is there 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.480
 keyword naruto species have 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.210
 liked this video 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.920
 so you like it lets me like that 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.920
 let leaked said
