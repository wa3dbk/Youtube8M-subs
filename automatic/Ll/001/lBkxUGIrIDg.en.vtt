00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it's up to you we've got the arm of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
it's up to you we've got the arm of
Creighton<00:00:42.540> dog<00:00:42.870> bones<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.620> now<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.100> think

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
Creighton dog bones in there now I think

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.369 
Creighton dog bones in there now I think
the<00:00:44.760> real<00:00:44.940> reason<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.480> bended<00:00:45.870> dog<00:00:46.079> bones

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the real reason I was bended dog bones

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.790 
the real reason I was bended dog bones
so<00:00:46.649> much<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.640> arms<00:00:48.149> stock<00:00:48.899> arms<00:00:51.680> one<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so much was the arms stock arms one of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.290 
so much was the arms stock arms one of
the<00:00:52.890> stock<00:00:53.129> arms<00:00:54.199> as<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.739> they're<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
the stock arms as you can see they're a

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.630 
the stock arms as you can see they're a
little<00:00:57.300> no<00:00:57.960> shape<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.070> they're<00:00:59.520> not

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
little no shape to them they're not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.569 
little no shape to them they're not
supposed<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:01.219> serpent<00:01:02.219> parks

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
supposed to have the serpent parks

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.800 
supposed to have the serpent parks
certainly<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.780> flex<00:01:04.409> much<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.600> see

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
certainly don't flex much so you can see

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.340 
certainly don't flex much so you can see
this<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.760> thing<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.350> definitely

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
this but this thing is definitely

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.670 
this but this thing is definitely
flexing<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.810> there<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.500> see

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
flexing and I think there you can see

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.160 
flexing and I think there you can see
the<00:01:14.040> whole<00:01:14.220> tail<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> outside<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> whole

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the whole tail in the outside the whole

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
the whole tail in the outside the whole
thing<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.549> you're<00:01:17.729> trying<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
thing and it's like you're trying to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.679 
thing and it's like you're trying to
smash<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> hamburger<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:20.299> definitely<00:01:21.299> not

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
smash a hamburger but definitely not

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.920 
smash a hamburger but definitely not

straight also over here we have you know

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
straight also over here we have you know
chassis<00:01:29.810> often<00:01:30.860> did<00:01:31.860> mean<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.909> right

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

on<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.049> chassis<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.549> were

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
on the chassis as you can see were

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.280 
on the chassis as you can see were
pretty<00:01:36.900> tweaked<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> back<00:01:37.650> there<00:01:39.290> right

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
pretty tweaked in the back there right

well<00:02:13.290> use<00:02:13.740> them<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.190> rear<00:02:14.370> -<00:02:14.610> right<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
well use them on the rear - right and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
well use them on the rear - right and
then<00:02:15.990> things<00:02:16.350> got<00:02:16.530> interesting<00:02:16.800> because

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
then things got interesting because

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.470 
then things got interesting because
serpent<00:02:18.060> mounts<00:02:18.660> their<00:02:19.460> rear<00:02:20.460> shocks<00:02:20.880> on<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
serpent mounts their rear shocks on the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.810 
serpent mounts their rear shocks on the
front<00:02:21.870> half<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.500> controller<00:02:23.070> towards<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
front half of the controller towards the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.810 
front half of the controller towards the
front<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> vehicle<00:02:24.560> then<00:02:25.560> stock<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
front of the vehicle then stock the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.810 
front of the vehicle then stock the
control<00:02:27.180> arms<00:02:27.690> now<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> shocks<00:02:29.160> mount<00:02:29.490> to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
control arms now for the shocks mount to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.660 
control arms now for the shocks mount to
the<00:02:29.940> rear<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.360> shock<00:02:30.600> tower<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.710> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
the rear of the shock tower here and the

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.630 
the rear of the shock tower here and the
back<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> arm<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:34.950> had<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> flip<00:02:35.460> my

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
back of the arm here so I had to flip my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.320 
back of the arm here so I had to flip my
shocks<00:02:35.970> forward<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.080> front<00:02:37.610> which<00:02:38.610> no<00:02:39.120> big

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
shocks forward to the front which no big

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.170 
shocks forward to the front which no big
deal<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.810> then<00:02:40.470> flip<00:02:40.830> my<00:02:41.010> steering<00:02:41.490> arm<00:02:41.820> right

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
deal and then flip my steering arm right

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.880 
deal and then flip my steering arm right
here<00:02:42.890> over<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.670> front<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.650> or<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
here over to the front of the or the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.830 
here over to the front of the or the
rear<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.520> shock<00:02:47.760> tower<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.360> basically<00:02:48.390> we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
rear of the shock tower so basically we

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.620 
rear of the shock tower so basically we
just<00:02:48.870> inverted<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.250> then<00:02:51.090> we're<00:02:51.360> still

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
just inverted that and then we're still

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.390 
just inverted that and then we're still
working<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.470> steering<00:02:52.800> angles<00:02:53.220> this

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
working on the steering angles this

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
working on the steering angles this
morning<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:55.320> going<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.970> probably<00:02:56.970> figure

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
morning and I'm going to probably figure

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.040 
morning and I'm going to probably figure
out<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.840> cvd<00:02:58.550> rear<00:02:59.550> drive<00:02:59.970> shaft<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.690> it

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
out you cvd rear drive shaft for it

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.900 
out you cvd rear drive shaft for it
I've<00:03:01.590> got<00:03:01.740> enough<00:03:01.950> parts<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:02.820> don't

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
I've got enough parts here that I don't

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.900 
I've got enough parts here that I don't
think<00:03:03.300> that'll<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.690> problem<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.920> we've

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
think that'll be a problem and we've

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.449 
think that'll be a problem and we've
also<00:03:06.150> got<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:08.250> know<00:03:08.340> some<00:03:09.680> stronger<00:03:10.680> options

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
also got you know some stronger options

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.730 
also got you know some stronger options
as<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:12.090> see<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.750> arm<00:03:12.990> stuff<00:03:13.440> looks

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
as you can see the arm stuff looks

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.640 
as you can see the arm stuff looks
really<00:03:13.830> nice<00:03:14.480> very<00:03:15.480> happy<00:03:15.810> happy<00:03:16.260> with<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
really nice very happy happy with the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.330 
really nice very happy happy with the
serpent<00:03:17.070> see<00:03:17.310> hubs<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.970> things<00:03:18.810> like<00:03:18.989> that

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
serpent see hubs and things like that

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.110 
serpent see hubs and things like that
looks<00:03:20.340> like<00:03:20.459> it's<00:03:20.610> going<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.820> work<00:03:20.910> flawlessly

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
looks like it's going to work flawlessly

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.960 
looks like it's going to work flawlessly
and<00:03:21.750> yes<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.070> full<00:03:23.310> droop<00:03:23.519> right<00:03:23.790> now

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and yes that is full droop right now

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.930 
and yes that is full droop right now
because<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.930> need<00:03:25.260> longer<00:03:25.500> shocks<00:03:25.890> they<00:03:26.519> often

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
because I need longer shocks they often

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.560 
because I need longer shocks they often
know<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:28.050> about<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.530> here<00:03:28.920> so<00:03:29.640> which<00:03:30.300> again<00:03:30.510> I

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
know is about in here so which again I

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.449 
know is about in here so which again I
don't<00:03:30.690> think<00:03:30.840> helps<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> stability<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.890> the

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
don't think helps the stability of the

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.650 
don't think helps the stability of the
arm<00:03:32.760> either<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:34.350> think<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.430> helps<00:03:35.820> or<00:03:36.090> gives

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
arm either I think that helps or gives

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.540 
arm either I think that helps or gives
it<00:03:36.780> more<00:03:36.900> area<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.320> flex<00:03:37.739> not<00:03:38.010> only<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.489> a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
it more area to flex not only is it a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.090 
it more area to flex not only is it a
weaker<00:03:38.970> arm<00:03:39.300> with<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.230> shock<00:03:40.440> being<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.890> here

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
weaker arm with the shock being in here

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.850 
weaker arm with the shock being in here
there's<00:03:41.280> gonna<00:03:41.370> be<00:03:41.519> more<00:03:41.870> load<00:03:42.870> out<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.560> I

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
there's gonna be more load out of here I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.479 
there's gonna be more load out of here I
think<00:03:44.310> again<00:03:45.470> might<00:03:46.470> go<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.830> single<00:03:47.250> top

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
think again might go to a single top

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.060 
think again might go to a single top
control<00:03:48.090> arm<00:03:48.330> not<00:03:48.810> sure<00:03:49.080> yet<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.739> working

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
control arm not sure yet this is working

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.120 
control arm not sure yet this is working
fine<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.930> got<00:03:52.080> some<00:03:52.230> longer<00:03:52.530> shots<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
fine but I got some longer shots on the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.110 
fine but I got some longer shots on the
way<00:03:54.049> there's<00:03:55.049> some<00:03:55.610> options<00:03:56.610> right<00:03:56.790> there<00:03:56.850> in

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
way there's some options right there in

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.699 
way there's some options right there in
the<00:03:57.239> back<00:03:57.420> of<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.660> kids<00:03:57.870> buggy<00:03:58.110> you'll<00:03:58.560> always

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
started this yesterday the serpent arms

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.580 
started this yesterday the serpent arms
I'm<00:04:21.000> very<00:04:21.630> impressed<00:04:22.049> with
