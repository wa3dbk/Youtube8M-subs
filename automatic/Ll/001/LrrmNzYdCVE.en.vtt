00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the ipad 4 and i think we'll start with

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.620 
the ipad 4 and i think we'll start with
the<00:00:25.949> form<00:00:26.220> factor<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.539> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
the form factor so you can see the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.370 
the form factor so you can see the
difference<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.650> ipad<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.099> wider<00:00:30.380> it's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
difference here the ipad is wider it's

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.670 
difference here the ipad is wider it's
about<00:00:31.710> an<00:00:32.340> inch<00:00:32.640> wider<00:00:32.970> I'd<00:00:33.150> say<00:00:33.620> bye<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
about an inch wider I'd say bye to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.660

Xperia tablet Z is of course higher

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.330 
Xperia tablet Z is of course higher
right<00:00:39.539> here<00:00:39.809> because<00:00:40.170> form<00:00:40.980> factor<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
right here because form factor is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
right here because form factor is

the bestest place you can ever get on a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.030 
the bestest place you can ever get on a
tablet<00:01:52.040> but<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:53.509> like<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.140> Xperia<00:01:54.560> tablet<00:01:55.009> Z

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040

tablet but I like the Xperia tablet Z
displayed<00:01:55.580> even<00:01:56.240> more<00:01:57.130> ok<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:59.649> speaking<00:02:00.649> of

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
displayed even more ok so speaking of

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.639 
displayed even more ok so speaking of
form<00:02:01.070> factors<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.210> see<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.690> ipad<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.380> a

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
form factors you can see the ipad is a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.639 
form factors you can see the ipad is a
bit<00:02:04.190> thicker<00:02:04.600> because<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.930> Xperia<00:02:06.259> tablet<00:02:06.619> Z

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
bit thicker because the Xperia tablet Z

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.500 
bit thicker because the Xperia tablet Z
is<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.460> thinnest<00:02:08.090> tablet<00:02:08.330> around<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> world

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
is the thinnest tablet around the world

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.080 
is the thinnest tablet around the world
and<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:11.870> very<00:02:12.200> light<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.070> um<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.790> ipad

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
and it also very light so um the ipad

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.229 
and it also very light so um the ipad
weighs<00:02:14.300> about<00:02:14.560> 650<00:02:15.560> grams<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.120> is

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
weighs about 650 grams and this one is

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.620 
weighs about 650 grams and this one is
just<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.769> just<00:02:18.769> above<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.100> pound<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.390> think

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
just a just above a pound so I think

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.680 
just a just above a pound so I think
it's<00:02:20.870> about<00:02:21.290> 500<00:02:21.620> grams<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:23.030> it's<00:02:23.180> very<00:02:23.450> light

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
it's about 500 grams and it's very light

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.290 
it's about 500 grams and it's very light
I<00:02:23.720> think<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.860> only<00:02:25.250> tablet<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.150> would

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
I think it's the only tablet I would

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.270 
I think it's the only tablet I would
recommend<00:02:26.630> for<00:02:26.989> one-handed<00:02:27.350> use<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.860> it's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
recommend for one-handed use so it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.970 
recommend for one-handed use so it's
really<00:02:28.610> no<00:02:28.910> no<00:02:29.420> pain<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.080> get<00:02:30.260> no<00:02:30.500> gorilla

the memory with microSD cards so you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.600 
the memory with microSD cards so you
don't<00:04:28.330> have<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.720> pay<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.900> lot<00:04:29.110> of<00:04:29.140> money<00:04:29.260> for<00:04:29.680> 32

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
don't have to pay a lot of money for 32

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.690 
don't have to pay a lot of money for 32
or<00:04:30.730> 64<00:04:31.270> gigabytes<00:04:31.690> version<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.650> um<00:04:32.920> that's<00:04:33.490> an

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
or 64 gigabytes version so um that's an

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.850 
or 64 gigabytes version so um that's an
advantage<00:04:33.820> definitely<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:35.470> in<00:04:35.740> the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
advantage definitely and so it's in the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.080 
advantage definitely and so it's in the
end<00:04:35.980> it's<00:04:36.130> definitely<00:04:36.970> cheaper<00:04:38.040> yeah<00:04:39.040> so<00:04:39.910> if

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090

best in my opinion the ipad is a way to
go<00:04:55.240> but<00:04:56.170> i<00:04:56.910> think<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.360> user<00:04:58.540> should<00:04:58.690> decide

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
go but i think the user should decide

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.990 
go but i think the user should decide
