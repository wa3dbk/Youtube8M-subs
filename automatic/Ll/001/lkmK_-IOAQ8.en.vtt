I had to accommodate my hand but a

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.450 
I had to accommodate my hand but a
simple<00:04:30.780> solution<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.230> that<00:04:31.470> was<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:32.040> just

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
simple solution for that was to just

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.650 
simple solution for that was to just
turn<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.820> vertical<00:04:33.240> grip<00:04:33.420> off<00:04:34.670> I<00:04:35.670> highly

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660
