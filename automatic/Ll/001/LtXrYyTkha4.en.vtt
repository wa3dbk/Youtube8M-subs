immediately on this piece of granite

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.670 
immediately on this piece of granite
we're<00:00:45.059> showing<00:00:45.450> how<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> water<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.440> starting

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
we're showing how the water is starting

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
we're showing how the water is starting
to<00:00:46.890> penetrate<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.440> just<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> standard<00:00:50.840> almond

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to penetrate and just a standard almond

to penetrate and just a standard almond
law<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.160> granite<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
law of granite and if you can see the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470 
law of granite and if you can see the
water<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.250> where<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.640> starting<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
water right there where it's starting to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.060 
water right there where it's starting to
darken<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:58.320> and<00:01:00.410> just<00:01:01.410> give<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:01.710> idea<00:01:01.800> that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
darken up and just give you an idea that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.840 
darken up and just give you an idea that
you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> pre<00:01:03.960> sealed<00:01:04.260> granite

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
you know it's not a pre sealed granite

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.539 
you know it's not a pre sealed granite
and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.420> clean<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.950> put

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and then we will clean this up and put

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then we will clean this up and put
the<00:01:08.700> sealer<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.240> afterwards<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.790> try<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.850> show

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the sealer on afterwards and try to show

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
the sealer on afterwards and try to show
you<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.369> angle<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> deflection<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.830> water

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
you the angle of deflection of the water

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
you the angle of deflection of the water
and<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.830> improve<00:01:20.189> after<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> seal

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and how it will improve after the seal

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.679 
and how it will improve after the seal
is<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.920> in<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.040> example<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
is on it in this example we can see the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.770 
is on it in this example we can see the
reflection<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> light<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.150> granite

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
reflection of the light in the granite

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.789 
reflection of the light in the granite
top<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.439> before<00:01:29.189> sealing<00:01:30.170> now<00:01:31.170> after

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
top and this is before sealing now after

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.190 
top and this is before sealing now after
we<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.700> application<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:34.049> will

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
we put our first application on we will

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.270 
we put our first application on we will
show<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.119> same<00:01:36.119> difference<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.920> color<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
show the same difference in the color of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600 
show the same difference in the color of
the<00:01:38.400> stone<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> lighting<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.340> first

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the stone and the lighting the first

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760 
the stone and the lighting the first
step<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.060> granite<00:01:42.540> shield<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:43.020> been<00:01:43.350> applied

step of granite shield has been applied

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.370 
step of granite shield has been applied
and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.939> don't<00:01:45.180> know<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.659> can<00:01:45.840> tell<00:01:46.140> by<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
and I don't know if you can tell by the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.639 
and I don't know if you can tell by the
video<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.299> it's<00:01:48.299> quite<00:01:48.659> obvious<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
video but it's quite obvious that the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.980 
video but it's quite obvious that the
Shine<00:01:49.979> has<00:01:50.009> already<00:01:50.759> increased<00:01:51.390> considerably

Shine has already increased considerably

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.139 
Shine has already increased considerably
and<00:01:53.240> there's<00:01:54.240> also<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:56.149> color

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and there's also a little more color

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.840 
and there's also a little more color
showing<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> granite<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.950> slight

as you can see the reflection of the
lights<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.650> getting<00:02:11.950> even<00:02:12.100> brighter<00:02:12.660> more

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
we are here with Mack again this is the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.330 
we are here with Mack again this is the
third<00:03:15.240> application<00:03:16.650> process<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.980> granite

third application process of the granite

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.730 
third application process of the granite
shield<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.820> Mack<00:03:19.570> what<00:03:19.930> kind<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.350> difference

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
shield and Mack what kind of difference

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.100 
shield and Mack what kind of difference
do<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:20.920> see<00:03:21.250> after<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.640> third<00:03:22.030> step<00:03:22.360> once<00:03:22.930> he

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
do you see after the third step once he

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.170 
do you see after the third step once he
was<00:03:23.230> stepped<00:03:23.530> up<00:03:23.710> more<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.280> reflection<00:03:25.090> was

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
was stepped up more the reflection was

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.390 
was stepped up more the reflection was
even<00:03:25.420> greater<00:03:25.630> than<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.870> was<00:03:26.050> now<00:03:26.290> what<00:03:27.220> kind

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
even greater than it was now what kind

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.920 
even greater than it was now what kind
of<00:03:27.460> percentage<00:03:27.790> would<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.150> estimate<00:03:28.450> it's

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
of percentage would you estimate it's

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.980 
of percentage would you estimate it's
increased<00:03:29.440> its<00:03:29.620> shine<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.630> say<00:03:31.840> it's

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
increased its shine and say it's

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.350 
increased its shine and say it's
increased<00:03:32.350> at<00:03:32.560> least<00:03:32.970> probably<00:03:33.970> 20<00:03:34.240> 25

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
increased at least probably 20 25

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.750 
increased at least probably 20 25
percent<00:03:35.050> more<00:03:35.080> that's<00:03:35.860> excellent

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
percent more that's excellent

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.240 
percent more that's excellent
well<00:03:37.270> we<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.630> two<00:03:37.990> more<00:03:38.140> steps<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.770> do<00:03:38.920> so

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
well we have two more steps to do so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.060 
well we have two more steps to do so
we'll<00:03:39.430> come<00:03:39.670> back<00:03:40.080> after<00:03:41.080> we<00:03:41.470> do<00:03:41.680> we're<00:03:41.950> going

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
we'll come back after we do we're going

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.040 
we'll come back after we do we're going
to<00:03:42.160> do<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> half<00:03:42.700> step<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.720> can<00:03:43.870> actually

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
to do a half step so you can actually

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.220 
to do a half step so you can actually
feel<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.740> difference<00:03:45.190> between<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:46.450> actual

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
feel the difference between the actual

feel the difference between the actual
carbon<00:03:48.100> crystal<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:49.360> we're<00:03:49.570> going<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.720> apply

this<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.889> got<00:04:24.009> more<00:04:24.160> drag<00:04:24.460> on<00:04:24.699> him<00:04:24.960> it's<00:04:25.960> not

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
this is got more drag on him it's not

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.100 
this is got more drag on him it's not
just<00:04:26.500> smooth<00:04:26.740> it's<00:04:27.639> smooth<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.960> what

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
just smooth it's smooth this is what

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.740 
just smooth it's smooth this is what
we're<00:04:29.229> here<00:04:29.259> yeah<00:04:29.830> it's<00:04:30.069> like<00:04:30.300> this<00:04:31.300> side<00:04:31.509> here

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
we're here yeah it's like this side here

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.870 
we're here yeah it's like this side here
has<00:04:31.900> more<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.199> a<00:04:32.460> resistance<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.699> know<00:04:33.789> I'm

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
has more of a resistance you know I'm

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.189 
has more of a resistance you know I'm
saying<00:04:34.150> mm-hmm

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
saying mm-hmm

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.860 
saying mm-hmm
this<00:04:35.680> moves<00:04:35.949> out<00:04:36.130> over<00:04:36.370> here<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.539> it's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
this moves out over here so it's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.330 
this moves out over here so it's
actually<00:04:38.080> an<00:04:38.410> improvement<00:04:38.650> on<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.099> stone

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
actually an improvement on the stone

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.460 
actually an improvement on the stone
itself<00:04:39.699> you<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.360> feel<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.690> yeah<00:04:40.840> excellent

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
itself you can feel it yeah excellent

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.990 
itself you can feel it yeah excellent
thank<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:42.430> back<00:04:44.009> okay<00:04:45.009> we<00:04:45.160> just<00:04:45.190> finished<00:04:45.849> the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
thank you back okay we just finished the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.960 
thank you back okay we just finished the
last<00:04:46.259> two<00:04:47.259> steps<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:48.069> the<00:04:48.280> granite<00:04:48.759> shield

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
last two steps of the granite shield

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.779 
last two steps of the granite shield
process<00:04:49.539> which<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:50.530> this<00:04:50.740> case<00:04:50.979> was<00:04:51.280> a<00:04:51.310> five

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
process which in this case was a five

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.200 
process which in this case was a five
step<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:53.080> as<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:53.919> can<00:04:54.099> see<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.580> reflection

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
step and as you can see the reflection

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.089 
step and as you can see the reflection
of<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.449> light<00:04:55.479> bulbs<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.229> as<00:04:56.410> prominent<00:04:56.889> as

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
of the light bulbs is as prominent as

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.460 
of the light bulbs is as prominent as
ever<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.639> Matt<00:04:58.630> you<00:04:58.870> were<00:04:58.990> saying<00:04:59.289> you

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
ever and Matt you were saying you

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.740 
ever and Matt you were saying you
thought<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.919> shine<00:05:00.310> increased<00:05:00.849> about<00:05:01.180> 25

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
thought the shine increased about 25

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.290 
thought the shine increased about 25
percent<00:05:02.320> overall<00:05:02.590> oh<00:05:02.919> we<00:05:03.220> got<00:05:03.370> in<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
percent overall oh we got in the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.710 
percent overall oh we got in the
smoothness<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.110> granite

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
smoothness of the granite

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.640 
smoothness of the granite
yeah<00:05:07.720> I've<00:05:07.840> increased<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.530> lot<00:05:10.169> okay<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:11.470> now

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
yeah I've increased a lot okay and now

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.920 
yeah I've increased a lot okay and now
we're<00:05:11.889> going<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.430> just<00:05:13.180> do<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.389> little<00:05:13.599> water

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
we're going to just do a little water

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.159 
we're going to just do a little water
test<00:05:14.380> here<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:14.830> show<00:05:15.099> I<00:05:15.520> don't<00:05:16.360> know<00:05:16.690> if<00:05:16.810> we<00:05:16.990> can

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
test here to show I don't know if we can

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.649 
test here to show I don't know if we can
see<00:05:17.409> this<00:05:17.560> on<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.919> camera<00:05:18.250> won't<00:05:18.789> do<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.180> zoom

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.990 

but<00:05:23.159> what<00:05:24.159> is<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.460> water<00:05:24.849> doing<00:05:25.240> right<00:05:25.599> there

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
but what is that water doing right there

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.589 
but what is that water doing right there
it's<00:05:28.000> just<00:05:28.949> okay<00:05:29.949> we<00:05:30.610> are<00:05:30.849> here<00:05:31.120> with<00:05:31.330> Matt

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
it's just okay we are here with Matt

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.960 
it's just okay we are here with Matt
again<00:05:31.960> on<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.349> fifth<00:05:32.800> and<00:05:32.979> final<00:05:33.190> step<00:05:33.639> of<00:05:33.820> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
again on the fifth and final step of the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.620 
again on the fifth and final step of the
granite<00:05:34.330> shield<00:05:34.570> process<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:36.419> just<00:05:37.419> in

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
granite shield process and just in

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.659 
granite shield process and just in
reiteration<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.949> said<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.370> shine

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
reiteration that you said the shine

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.680 
reiteration that you said the shine
increased<00:05:40.210> about<00:05:40.630> 25%<00:05:41.130> oh<00:05:42.130> yeah<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:43.150> the

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
increased about 25% oh yeah and the

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.990 
increased about 25% oh yeah and the
smoothness<00:05:44.320> of<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.710> granite<00:05:45.219> that's<00:05:45.669> really

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
smoothness of the granite that's really

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.600 
smoothness of the granite that's really
improved<00:05:46.330> I<00:05:46.479> mean<00:05:46.599> that<00:05:46.719> is<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.840> slick<00:05:47.550> now<00:05:48.550> we

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
improved I mean that is a slick now we

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.640 
improved I mean that is a slick now we
poured<00:05:49.030> some<00:05:49.300> water<00:05:49.479> on<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:50.050> granite<00:05:50.289> they're

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
poured some water on the granite they're

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.290 
poured some water on the granite they're
about<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:51.280> what<00:05:51.610> five<00:05:51.940> minutes<00:05:52.180> ago<00:05:52.599> or<00:05:52.719> so<00:05:52.930> and

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
about to what five minutes ago or so and

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.209 
about to what five minutes ago or so and
what's<00:05:55.300> that<00:05:55.539> what's<00:05:56.080> that<00:05:56.169> water<00:05:56.500> doing<00:05:57.070> on

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
what's that what's that water doing on

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.399 
what's that what's that water doing on
the<00:05:57.370> granite<00:05:57.900> absolutely<00:05:58.900> nothing's<00:05:59.259> not

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
the granite absolutely nothing's not

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.450 
the granite absolutely nothing's not
going<00:05:59.650> anywhere<00:05:59.889> just<00:06:00.789> beat<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.120> up<00:06:01.889> and<00:06:02.889> go

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
going anywhere just beat it up and go

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.430 
going anywhere just beat it up and go
ahead<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.880> blow<00:06:04.090> on<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.360> water<00:06:04.930> see<00:06:05.320> what

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
ahead and blow on that water see what

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:15.390 
ahead and blow on that water see what
happens<00:06:09.180> around<00:06:10.380> slides<00:06:11.380> across<00:06:11.710> it<00:06:11.949> so<00:06:14.400> are

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
happens around slides across it so are

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.370 
happens around slides across it so are
you<00:06:15.610> satisfied<00:06:15.849> what<00:06:16.570> you<00:06:16.840> had<00:06:17.139> mentioned

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
you satisfied what you had mentioned

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.260 
you satisfied what you had mentioned
that<00:06:17.710> you<00:06:17.919> were<00:06:18.009> intrigued<00:06:18.520> by<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:18.789> granite

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
that you were intrigued by the granite

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.680 
that you were intrigued by the granite
shield<00:06:19.479> process<00:06:19.930> for<00:06:20.469> what<00:06:20.620> reason<00:06:21.690> well

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
shield process for what reason well

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.749 
shield process for what reason well
that's<00:06:22.810> like<00:06:23.110> they<00:06:23.289> say<00:06:23.500> it's<00:06:23.620> lifetime<00:06:24.039> so

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
that's like they say it's lifetime so

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.659 
that's like they say it's lifetime so
you<00:06:25.270> only<00:06:25.389> have<00:06:25.449> to<00:06:25.570> do<00:06:25.750> it<00:06:25.840> one<00:06:25.990> done<00:06:26.669> rather

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
you only have to do it one done rather

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:28.980 
you only have to do it one done rather
than<00:06:27.789> like<00:06:27.940> a<00:06:27.969> bit<00:06:28.180> rare<00:06:28.330> the<00:06:28.479> other<00:06:28.570> stuff

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
than like a bit rare the other stuff

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.830 
than like a bit rare the other stuff
that<00:06:29.020> was<00:06:29.289> told

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
that was told

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.659 
that was told
to<00:06:29.960> do<00:06:30.080> about<00:06:30.260> every<00:06:30.440> six<00:06:30.710> months<00:06:31.010> or<00:06:31.130> so<00:06:31.280> and

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
to do about every six months or so and

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.670 
to do about every six months or so and
the<00:06:32.570> unique<00:06:32.810> thing<00:06:33.020> about<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.440> granite

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
the unique thing about the granite

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.430 
the unique thing about the granite
shield<00:06:34.010> process<00:06:34.580> is<00:06:34.850> the<00:06:35.120> best<00:06:35.389> cleaners<00:06:36.139> for

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
shield process is the best cleaners for
