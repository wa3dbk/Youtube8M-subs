in<00:00:00.650> this<00:00:01.650> tutorial<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.370> will<00:00:02.399> be<00:00:02.669> covering<00:00:03.000> how

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
in this tutorial I will be covering how

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.930 
in this tutorial I will be covering how
I<00:00:03.300> rotate<00:00:03.929> pixel<00:00:04.380> art<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.740> Photoshop<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.700> how

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
I rotate pixel art in Photoshop and how

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.230 
I rotate pixel art in Photoshop and how
to<00:00:06.000> keep<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:06.629> clean<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:07.649> using<00:00:07.919> photoshop<00:00:08.519> cs5

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
to keep it clean I'm using photoshop cs5

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.330 
to keep it clean I'm using photoshop cs5
and<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:09.750> working<00:00:09.929> with<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.260> pixel<00:00:10.830> when<00:00:11.040> mental

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
and I'm working with a pixel when mental

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.520 
and I'm working with a pixel when mental
image<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> already<00:00:12.360> made<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:13.049> problem

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
image that I already made the problem

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.650 
image that I already made the problem
when<00:00:13.679> rotating<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.309> pixel<00:00:14.639> image<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.030> Photoshop

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
when rotating a pixel image in Photoshop

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.650 
when rotating a pixel image in Photoshop
is<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.199> when<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> apply<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> rotation

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
is that when you apply the rotation

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
is that when you apply the rotation
transformation<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.990> pixel<00:00:19.320> art<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
transformation the pixel art is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.679 
transformation the pixel art is
interpreted<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> more<00:00:20.820> fuzzy<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.480> less

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
interpreted as a more fuzzy and less

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
interpreted as a more fuzzy and less
cleaned<00:00:22.050> image<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.519> from<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
cleaned image as you can see from the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.120 
cleaned image as you can see from the
zoomed<00:00:24.539> up<00:00:24.750> difference<00:00:25.260> between<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> clean

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
zoomed up difference between the clean

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
zoomed up difference between the clean
unrotated<00:00:26.730> windmill<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.810> slightly

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
unrotated windmill and they slightly

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.650 
unrotated windmill and they slightly
rotate<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:28.980> middle<00:00:29.189> which<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.849> more<00:00:30.150> fuzzy

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
rotate at one middle which is more fuzzy

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.280 
rotate at one middle which is more fuzzy
and<00:00:30.869> less<00:00:31.080> defined<00:00:32.090> for<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> cleaner<00:00:33.480> rotation

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and less defined for a cleaner rotation

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020

image<00:00:34.680> you'll<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.370> take<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> screenshot

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030

at<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.600> hundred<00:00:36.870> percent<00:00:37.079> from<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> rotation

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

I<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> pixel<00:01:54.329> animation<00:01:54.899> frames

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
I have all of the pixel animation frames

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
I have all of the pixel animation frames
that<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.649> need<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.130> make<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.280> full<00:01:56.549> rotation<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that I need to make a full rotation so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.590 
that I need to make a full rotation so
the<00:01:57.630> animation<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.530> loop<00:01:58.770> smoothly

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the animation can loop smoothly

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600 
the animation can loop smoothly
and<00:02:01.600> that's<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.110> basics<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.590> how<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.800> rotate

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
and that's the basics of how I rotate

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.060 
and that's the basics of how I rotate
