00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.769 
wade to Batgirl the Barbara Gordon
Batgirl<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.039> Silver<00:00:18.000> Age<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.420> believe

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
Batgirl this is the Silver Age I believe

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.080 
Batgirl this is the Silver Age I believe
I'm<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.859> sure<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.640> she<00:00:20.939> came

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I'm not sure about that but she came

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.810 
I'm not sure about that but she came
with<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> silver<00:00:21.539> base<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.400> then<00:00:23.400> came<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
with a silver base and then came with a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.230 
with a silver base and then came with a
gold<00:00:24.060> base<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.810> I'm<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.260> bet<00:00:26.060> that's<00:00:27.060> what

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
gold base so I'm gonna bet that's what

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
gold base so I'm gonna bet that's what
that<00:00:27.390> means<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.869> could<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.500> completely<00:00:28.650> wrong

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
that means I could be completely wrong

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.609
