00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
game since its debut in Mario Kart 64
but<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> pretty<00:01:32.520> safe<00:01:32.790> bet<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.180> if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
but it's a pretty safe bet that if

you're in first or second or third place

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.319 
you're in first or second or third place
you<00:01:34.799> will<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.520> getting<00:01:35.759> any<00:01:35.790> blue<00:01:36.090> shells

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you will not be getting any blue shells

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.499 
you will not be getting any blue shells
at<00:01:36.750> least<00:01:37.020> not<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> way<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> you'd<00:01:37.799> like

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
at least not in the way that you'd like

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.760 
at least not in the way that you'd like
so<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.689> reason<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> blue<00:01:40.409> shell<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
so one reason for the blue shell to

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.530 
so one reason for the blue shell to
exist<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> obviously<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.180> serve<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
exist is obviously to serve as a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
exist is obviously to serve as a

to<00:02:01.950> come<00:02:02.100> back

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
to come back

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.450 
to come back

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
but here's the really crazy thing it's

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.610 
but here's the really crazy thing it's
actually<00:02:04.670> not<00:02:05.090> fun<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.600> uncontested<00:02:06.470> way

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
actually not fun to be uncontested way

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.500 
actually not fun to be uncontested way

other players it just turns into a
mediocre<00:02:17.630> racing<00:02:18.290> game<00:02:18.500> at<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.770> point

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
mediocre racing game at that point

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.280 
mediocre racing game at that point
instead<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> wild<00:02:20.120> goofy<00:02:20.570> kart<00:02:20.840> racer<00:02:21.170> we

drives you toward a play state that's
way<00:02:37.220> less<00:02:37.460> interesting<00:02:37.940> than<00:02:38.090> most<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.390> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
way less interesting than most of the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.820 
way less interesting than most of the
rest<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> game<00:02:38.960> which<00:02:39.380> makes<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.800> game

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
rest of the game which makes the game

rest of the game which makes the game
less<00:02:40.160> fun<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.400> everybody<00:02:40.760> involved<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
less fun for everybody involved so the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.540 
less fun for everybody involved so the
designers<00:02:42.320> had<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.590> include<00:02:42.860> something<00:02:43.460> to

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
designers had to include something to

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.610 
designers had to include something to
prevent<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:43.940> from<00:02:44.000> happening<00:02:44.180> hence<00:02:45.080> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
prevent this from happening hence the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.680 
prevent this from happening hence the
blue<00:02:45.740> shell<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.370> weapon<00:02:46.910> which<00:02:47.090> when<00:02:47.390> fired

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
will not stop until it has exploded on

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.990 
will not stop until it has exploded on
the<00:02:50.030> racer<00:02:50.300> in<00:02:50.420> first<00:02:50.630> place<00:02:51.580> but<00:02:52.580> adding<00:02:52.910> the

the designers are trying to build close
races<00:02:58.670> where<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> players<00:02:59.180> are<00:02:59.360> constantly

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
races where the players are constantly

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
hands on a blue shell they could very

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.670 
hands on a blue shell they could very
easily<00:03:04.820> use<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.570> claim<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.840> huge<00:03:06.200> lead<00:03:06.470> for

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
easily use it to claim a huge lead for

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.100 
easily use it to claim a huge lead for
themselves<00:03:07.030> which<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.390> leaves<00:03:08.660> us<00:03:08.780> with<00:03:08.989> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
themselves which just leaves us with the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.180 
themselves which just leaves us with the
same<00:03:09.260> design<00:03:09.590> problem<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.100> had<00:03:10.220> before<00:03:12.190> this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
same design problem we had before this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.920 
same design problem we had before this
is<00:03:13.370> why<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.550> item<00:03:13.970> only<00:03:14.120> shows<00:03:14.480> up<00:03:14.660> for<00:03:14.840> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
is why the item only shows up for the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.390 
is why the item only shows up for the
players<00:03:15.140> who<00:03:15.260> are<00:03:15.380> pretty<00:03:15.709> far<00:03:15.890> behind<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
players who are pretty far behind in the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430 
players who are pretty far behind in the
pack<00:03:16.580> it's<00:03:17.300> not<00:03:17.510> just<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.900> way<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.050> help<00:03:18.260> the
