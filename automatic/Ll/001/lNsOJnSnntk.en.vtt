00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.410 
one this is a que tech traveler boompole
which<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.880> probably<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
which is really like probably one of the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
which is really like probably one of the
smallest<00:01:15.600> bump<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.920> it
