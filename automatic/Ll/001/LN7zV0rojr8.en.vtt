00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hello shop with us to the fund 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.809
 welcomes you want to introduce you to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:18.710
 new model is called lenovo p 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:21.859
 390 it is new even for august september 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.859
 year 2013 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.130
 what's not interesting is of course the price 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.369
 that is, lenovo tried 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.420
 minimize the cost to make 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.739
 smartphone maximum available and so and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.950
 then let's look at him 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.170
 internal technical condition 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.760
 we have a battery here 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.399
 like the iPhone the fifth iPhone 5 1450 here 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.590
 1,500 milliamp-hours 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.710
 no new batteries ever no one 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.710
 cheated 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:07.590
 The back cover is like this 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:10.979
 matte and glossy simple easy 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.010
 click it closed like that from the outside 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.380
 the kind that we have here on top for three with 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.920
 half of them gambling and button 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.150
 lock and power behind the camera 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 and ringer that is, we call the microphone 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.990
 is here here here so this external 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.080
 panel to here we have nothing here 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.240
 us rocker for volume 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.860
 so mean despite his 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.320
 the lowest possible price is quite self 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:01.440
 powerful machine and so the benchmark result 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:05.250
 antutu about 7,000 information information 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.800
 so what do we have here are kept here 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.710
 we have a dual core processor frequency 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.480
 1000 hertz 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.830
 screen resolution 480 by 800 operational 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.070
 memory we have 512 of them are now available 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.600
 179 megabytes many tasks of course 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.310
 it will be difficult to turn around 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.180
 grow one puzzle there browser or 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 it will be enough toy to start it 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.290
 camera 5 megapixel version android 4 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.760
 which is much nicer than the second version 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.760
 android 4 0 4 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.410
 so here is what account benchmark 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:58.510
 run like this and there would be you but not 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.810
 on the mark you see the result previous 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.890
 was 28 fps 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.890
 which rate is generated 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.640
 me mark postcard patchwork which 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.640
 measures the number of frames per second 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.100
 which can generate some 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.670
 test 3d image 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.110
 the test turned out twenty seven fps then 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.110
 there are 27 frames per second 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.550
 Thanks for attention
