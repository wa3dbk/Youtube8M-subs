00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you saw it too far off the password

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.240 
you saw it too far off the password
thing<00:01:53.189> will<00:01:53.399> come<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> word<00:01:55.470> word

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
thing will come up it is a word word

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
thing will come up it is a word word
password<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> same<00:01:57.509> pin<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.110> if

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
password it's not the same pin so if

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.780 
password it's not the same pin so if

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
can see I'll go ahead and slide to power

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.590 
can see I'll go ahead and slide to power
off<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.950> power<00:02:20.400> got<00:02:20.610> notification<00:02:21.240> comes<00:02:21.330> up

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
off the power got notification comes up

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.960 
off the power got notification comes up
and<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:22.470> says<00:02:22.650> insert<00:02:23.070> your<00:02:23.280> security<00:02:23.760> code

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and it says insert your security code

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.030 
and it says insert your security code
now<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.870> somebody<00:02:25.230> doesn't<00:02:25.380> have<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.590> security

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
now if somebody doesn't have a security

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.380 
now if somebody doesn't have a security
code<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.340> can't<00:02:26.520> really<00:02:26.610> turn<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.000> off<00:02:27.150> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
code they can't really turn it off and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.880 
code they can't really turn it off and
how<00:02:27.990> does<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.350> really<00:02:28.620> help<00:02:28.890> against

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
how does this really help against

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.080 
how does this really help against
against<00:02:31.890> people<00:02:32.160> stealing<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.580> phone<00:02:32.790> well

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
against people stealing your phone well

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
basically the only way you can really

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.530 
basically the only way you can really
work<00:02:34.830> around<00:02:35.190> Find<00:02:35.460> My<00:02:35.580> iPhone<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.270> do<00:02:36.360> one

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
work around Find My iPhone is to do one

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.900 
work around Find My iPhone is to do one
of<00:02:36.660> two<00:02:36.810> things<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.160> turn<00:02:38.580> off<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
of two things you see you turn off the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.870 
of two things you see you turn off the
phone<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:40.160> actually<00:02:41.160> take<00:02:41.370> out<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.640> SIM<00:02:41.850> card

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
phone or actually take out the SIM card

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.440 
phone or actually take out the SIM card
now<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.800> your<00:02:44.100> CDMA<00:02:44.580> users<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> States

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
now all your CDMA users in the States

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.000 
now all your CDMA users in the States
and<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.900> guess<00:02:46.080> anywhere<00:02:46.620> around<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.980> world

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and I guess anywhere around the world

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.160 
and I guess anywhere around the world
who<00:02:47.580> don't<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:47.970> SIM<00:02:48.300> card<00:02:48.540> slots<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:48.990> is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
who don't have SIM card slots this is

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.840 
who don't have SIM card slots this is
the<00:02:49.380> foolproof<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> make<00:02:50.550> sure<00:02:50.700> your
