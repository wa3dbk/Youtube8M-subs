help<00:02:02.030> with<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.240> brain<00:02:02.570> digestive<00:02:03.350> tract<00:02:03.649> and

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
help with the brain digestive tract and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.300 
help with the brain digestive tract and
heart<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.780> if<00:02:05.780> something's<00:02:06.200> off<00:02:06.409> kilter<00:02:06.710> your

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
heart and if something's off kilter your

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.949 
heart and if something's off kilter your
body's<00:02:07.759> not<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.060> function<00:02:08.269> now<00:02:08.569> feel

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
body's not going to function now feel

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.500 
body's not going to function now feel
good<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.649> trace<00:02:10.640> minerals<00:02:10.970> very<00:02:11.269> very

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
good so trace minerals very very

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.410 
good so trace minerals very very
important<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.670> difference<00:02:14.030> between<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
important and the difference between a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.390 
important and the difference between a
mackerel<00:02:14.900> mineral<00:02:15.260> which<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.620> calcium<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
mackerel mineral which is calcium and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.520 
mackerel mineral which is calcium and
magnesium<00:02:16.519> they're<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.300> obviously<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.080> big

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
magnesium they're just obviously a big

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.890 
magnesium they're just obviously a big
mineral<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.130> trace<00:02:20.060> minerals<00:02:20.450> are<00:02:20.540> ionic

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
mineral and trace minerals are ionic

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.320 
mineral and trace minerals are ionic
small<00:02:21.739> trace<00:02:22.190> amounts<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.299> a

we've<00:02:37.730> got<00:02:37.790> distilled<00:02:38.239> water<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.290> one

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
we've got distilled water on this one

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.949 
we've got distilled water on this one
and<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.850> still<00:02:41.120> water<00:02:41.269> in<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.630> one

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
and I have to still water in this one

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.839 
and I have to still water in this one
and<00:02:42.230> distilled<00:02:42.950> water<00:02:43.100> in<00:02:43.310> this<00:02:43.430> one<00:02:43.700> but

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
and distilled water in this one but

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.550 
and distilled water in this one but
again<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.180> nickel<00:02:44.540> shows<00:02:44.780> up<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.260> I'm<00:02:45.349> showing

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
again the nickel shows up so I'm showing

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.640 
again the nickel shows up so I'm showing
there's<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:46.819> true<00:02:47.180> test<00:02:47.650> chemistry

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
there's this is a true test chemistry

doesn't<00:02:53.540> go<00:02:53.690> up<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.140> much<00:02:55.329> your<00:02:56.329> tomato<00:02:57.190> so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
doesn't go up so much your tomato so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.729 
doesn't go up so much your tomato so
this<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.630> your<00:02:59.780> food<00:02:59.930> your<00:03:00.230> raw<00:03:00.410> food<00:03:00.709> that

you're in taking without cooking and

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.349 
you're in taking without cooking and
changing<00:03:03.980> everything<00:03:04.190> but<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.030> know<00:03:05.150> how<00:03:05.299> we

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
changing everything but you know how we

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.349 
changing everything but you know how we
always<00:03:05.630> say<00:03:06.489> an<00:03:07.489> apple<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.880> day<00:03:07.910> keeps<00:03:08.030> the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
always say an apple a day keeps the

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.060 
always say an apple a day keeps the
doctor<00:03:08.450> away<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.260> look<00:03:09.380> at<00:03:09.470> your<00:03:09.620> Apple<00:03:09.950> these

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
doctor away and look at your Apple these

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.330 
doctor away and look at your Apple these
days<00:03:10.250> this<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.489> an<00:03:10.730> organic<00:03:11.180> apple<00:03:11.329> by<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.900> way

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
days this is an organic apple by the way

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.580 
days this is an organic apple by the way
so<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> lights<00:03:13.670> not<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.120> bright<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.870> here's

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
so the lights not so bright and here's

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.360 
so the lights not so bright and here's
the<00:03:15.799> last<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.220> is<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> potato<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:18.560> that

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
the last one is a potato and so that

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.009 
the last one is a potato and so that
said<00:03:19.730> if<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.000> can<00:03:20.120> imagine<00:03:20.540> what<00:03:20.660> happens

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
said if you can imagine what happens

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.050 
said if you can imagine what happens
when<00:03:21.200> it's<00:03:21.319> cooked<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.890> Winston<00:03:22.700> if<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:22.880> don't

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
when it's cooked so Winston if you don't

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.050 
when it's cooked so Winston if you don't
mind<00:03:23.329> you<00:03:24.019> know<00:03:24.109> take<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> second<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.910> is

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
mind you know take a second and this is

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.840 
mind you know take a second and this is
alfalfa<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.750> we<00:03:26.840> have<00:03:27.079> here<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.579> alfalfa<00:03:28.579> is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
alfalfa that we have here and alfalfa is

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.830 
alfalfa that we have here and alfalfa is
a<00:03:28.880> terrific

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
a terrific

difference the food that we eat when
it's<00:03:46.910> being<00:03:47.060> farmed<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:48.260> root<00:03:48.410> system<00:03:48.799> is

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
it's being farmed the root system is

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.640 
it's being farmed the root system is
only<00:03:49.010> two<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.519> three<00:03:49.790> feet<00:03:50.090> deep<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:51.019> actually

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
only two to three feet deep and actually

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.610 
only two to three feet deep and actually
alfalfa<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.370> seven<00:03:52.850> feet<00:03:53.060> deep<00:03:53.329> so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
alfalfa is a seven feet deep so

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.509 
alfalfa is a seven feet deep so
hopefully<00:03:54.620> we'll<00:03:54.799> see<00:03:54.949> a<00:03:54.979> little<00:03:55.130> bit<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.459> a

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
difference so it is brighter than the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.390 
difference so it is brighter than the
food

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400
