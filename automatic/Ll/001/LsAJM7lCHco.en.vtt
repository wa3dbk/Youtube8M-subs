 Good day dear 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.990
 needlewomen in this video tutorial will 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.680
 demonstrated knitting process 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.790
 knitting needles Ethiopian gum 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.180
 this is the front side is the wrong side 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.650
 pattern side 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.579
 gum is elastic 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.970
 direct product from such a pattern is good 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:43.210
 keeps its shape and looks spectacular to knit 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:47.260
 anything can be scarves hats 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.860
 jackets maybe even a coat with a lining 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.530
 so this gum pattern itself 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.500
 knit on the seamy side 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.730
 therefore it is necessary before knitting 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.860
 knit 1 row 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:34.939
 loop can be removed in one motion 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:36.850
