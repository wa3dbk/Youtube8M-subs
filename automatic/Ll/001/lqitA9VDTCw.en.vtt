00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.220
 hello again dear friends with you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.140
 arsik san and this is a small review on the new 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.730
 combat knife kukri blade 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.220
 and immediately a little question exciting 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 most players are kukri cost 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.529
 opens only at the thirtieth level and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.259
 It will cost 13200 funds to the sides without 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.259
 collateral 63 thousand credits or 2000 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.070
 pounds at a time you can not buy it only 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.780
 only forever 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.290
 well now let's take a look at it 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.460
 more detail kukri closer to doll this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 national combat knife 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.080
 use and not Polish slides blade 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.060
 has a falcon wing profile sharpening 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.570
 shelves over the game is not that is it but with 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.490
 reverse bend immediately worth noting 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.280
 some pretty significant differences 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.170
 from the standard you need only two 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 this is the range of defeat and speed 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.760
 standard knife strikes one and a half 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.239
 meters when the kitchen is almost two with 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.489
 by half 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 on the speed of hitting the same kukri not 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.100
 superior to standard but only slightly 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100
 inferior to him 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.070
 as soon as you take kukri in your hands 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.869
 it seems that nothing has changed 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 but after a few frags you 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.380
 I remember the good old knife 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.440
 existed before march patch 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.720
 This year's apex with a doll again 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.190
 we can punish the fleeing enemy in the back 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 like it used to be with an old knife i 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.940
 poorly understand the developers who 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.130
 thought up to make the discovery of kukri right on 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.020
 the thirtieth level may not have wanted 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.270
 fun or routed to loot 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.110
 pumped and seasoned folders seeing this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.360
 nice katana 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 I think they did it great. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:56.160
 considering the fact that the katana turned out 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 like the layout is brutal cool i think that 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.619
 I'll take kukri wars to fly permanent 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 the base 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.970
 as the tribute of defeat is noticeably more 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.100
 stationary knife and this is for the scout 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.409
 especially for me actively using 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.959
 the knife is very important and not only for 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.790
 scout for any kukri class will 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.260
 very useful unless of course you 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.260
 ignore the knife and melee 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.620
 Perhaps we summarize our review 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.510
 we have a new cool blade kukri for 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.060
 beauty level with greater range 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.070
 lesions than standard knife but up 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.350
 you will have to pump him either 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.300
 fork out if you already 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.520
 pumped up to 3 sata levels then 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.610
 be sure to buy so the price from him 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.130
 pretty democratic on that from me 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.530
