00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
without going on the internet and

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.460 
without going on the internet and

looking through wikis and whatnot so

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.990 
looking through wikis and whatnot so
it's<00:00:20.590> very<00:00:20.650> simple<00:00:20.890> you<00:00:21.039> can<00:00:21.310> do<00:00:21.429> it<00:00:21.490> via<00:00:21.699> c'mon

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
it's very simple you can do it via c'mon

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.620 
it's very simple you can do it via c'mon
and<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:23.650> it<00:00:24.460> works<00:00:24.640> in<00:00:24.789> two<00:00:24.970> ways<00:00:25.000> so<00:00:25.480> the

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
and then it works in two ways so the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.429 
and then it works in two ways so the
first<00:00:25.810> way<00:00:25.990> is<00:00:26.169> if<00:00:26.980> you<00:00:27.099> have<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:28.779> item<00:00:29.259> in<00:00:29.349> your

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
first way is if you have an item in your

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.370 
first way is if you have an item in your
hand<00:00:29.650> say<00:00:29.919> it<00:00:30.070> chest<00:00:30.460> plate<00:00:30.669> and<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:31.749> recipe<00:00:32.169> it

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
hand say it chest plate and do recipe it

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.430 
hand say it chest plate and do recipe it
will<00:00:32.560> look<00:00:32.710> up<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.880> recipe<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.240> the<00:00:34.810> item

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
will look up the recipe of the item

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.290 
will look up the recipe of the item

crafting recipes for all the rails and

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.660 
crafting recipes for all the rails and
they<00:01:21.970> would<00:01:22.120> be<00:01:22.270> quite<00:01:22.540> difficult<00:01:23.010> for<00:01:24.010> people

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
they would be quite difficult for people

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.640 
they would be quite difficult for people
who<00:01:24.730> don't<00:01:24.850> speak<00:01:25.030> fluent<00:01:25.390> English<00:01:25.690> they<00:01:26.320> do

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.930 
is a brilliant plug-in very lightweight
it's<00:01:32.290> free<00:01:32.680> office<00:01:33.190> bigger<00:01:33.400> which<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.909> a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
it's free office bigger which is a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's free office bigger which is a
really<00:01:34.150> nice<00:01:34.270> feature<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:35.040> another<00:01:36.040> cool

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
really nice feature and another cool

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.340 
really nice feature and another cool
thing<00:01:36.400> is<00:01:36.670> smelting<00:01:37.360> recipes<00:01:37.780> are<00:01:38.020> also

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
thing is smelting recipes are also

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.300 
thing is smelting recipes are also
supported<00:01:39.280> which<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.880> really<00:01:40.540> cool<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
supported which is really cool and I

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.969 
supported which is really cool and I
believe<00:01:42.729> there<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.090> also<00:01:43.710> multi-languages<00:01:44.710> so

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
believe there is also multi-languages so

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.920 
believe there is also multi-languages so
you<00:01:45.040> can<00:01:45.250> set<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.610> another<00:01:46.150> language<00:01:46.450> not

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
you can set it to another language not

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.050 
you can set it to another language not
just<00:01:47.140> English<00:01:47.290> which<00:01:47.799> is<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:48.250> very<00:01:48.850> nice

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060

feature so um yeah rats the charcoal

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.680 
feature so um yeah rats the charcoal
citiz<00:01:54.940> works<00:01:55.210> and<00:01:55.510> yeah<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.200> one<00:01:56.560> of<00:01:56.590> the
