here to talk to you about adjusting the
tension<00:00:06.390> on<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.629> knitting<00:00:07.049> machine<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:08.280> can

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
tension on a knitting machine it can

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.190 
tension on a knitting machine it can
make<00:00:08.670> all<00:00:08.880> sorts<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.450> difference<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
make all sorts of difference to the

make all sorts of difference to the
smoothness<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.099> knitting<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.670> it

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
smoothness of the knitting and it

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.570 
smoothness of the knitting and it
controls<00:00:12.780> how<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> yarn<00:00:13.590> feeds<00:00:14.040> through<00:00:14.429> the

I'm<00:00:30.990> indicating<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> dental<00:00:32.160> tool<00:00:32.369> as

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
I'm indicating with the dental tool as

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.470 
I'm indicating with the dental tool as
you<00:00:33.840> increase<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.739> numbers<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:36.090> also

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you increase the numbers you also

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.940 
you increase the numbers you also
increase<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.320> tension<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> yarn<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
increase the tension on the yarn you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.410 
increase the tension on the yarn you
might<00:00:41.160> even<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> able<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.270> that's

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
might even be able to see that that's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.319 
might even be able to see that that's
tighter<00:00:42.870> than<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> was

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
tighter than it was

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.819 
tighter than it was
now<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.660> crud<00:00:46.489> such<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.730> bits<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.120> yarn<00:00:48.390> or<00:00:49.260> rust

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
now if crud such as bits of yarn or rust

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.389 
now if crud such as bits of yarn or rust
or<00:00:50.219> anything<00:00:50.360> gets<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.920> make<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
or anything gets in here it can make the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.299 
or anything gets in here it can make the
tension<00:00:53.850> or<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.180> work<00:00:54.480> properly<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
tension or not work properly so you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.029 
tension or not work properly so you
always<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.059> make<00:00:57.180> sure<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.620> clean

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
always want to make sure that it's clean

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
always want to make sure that it's clean

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
through the end of it here I have my

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.830 
through the end of it here I have my
tensioner<00:01:26.250> set<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.640> seven<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
tensioner set on seven which is the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.469 
tensioner set on seven which is the
highest<00:01:28.320> setting<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.490> particular<00:01:30.150> mask

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
highest setting for this particular mask

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.770 
highest setting for this particular mask
and<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.799> knitting<00:01:32.189> fine<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.570> what

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
and it's knitting fine but look what

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
and it's knitting fine but look what
happened<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.860> last<00:01:35.130> stitch<00:01:35.549> didn't<00:01:36.000> really

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
happened the last stitch didn't really

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.340 
happened the last stitch didn't really
want<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> knit<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> all<00:01:37.460> right<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:39.170> that's<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
want to knit it all right there that's a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.399 
want to knit it all right there that's a
sign<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.430> too<00:01:41.700> much<00:01:41.729> tension

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
sign that that's a bit too much tension

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.440 
sign that that's a bit too much tension
it<00:01:43.409> would<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> sign<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.240> last

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
it would also be a sign if the last

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.690 
it would also be a sign if the last
three<00:01:45.810> stitches<00:01:45.869> were<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:46.979> very<00:01:47.250> tight

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
three stitches were very very very tight

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.480 
three stitches were very very very tight
I've<00:01:50.700> reduced<00:01:51.180> my<00:01:51.450> tension<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.310> it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
I've reduced my tension and I think it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.980 
I've reduced my tension and I think it's
knitting<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.570> I'm<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
knitting just right now I'm going to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.830 
knitting just right now I'm going to
have<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.350> hold<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> camera'<00:01:56.189> by<00:01:56.340> hand

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
have to hold the camera' by hand

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.080 
have to hold the camera' by hand
otherwise<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.079> wouldn't<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.350> able<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.680> see

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.620 

well<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.329> doing<00:02:03.719> very<00:02:03.750> well<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:06.299> how<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
well that's doing very well and how I

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.139 
well that's doing very well and how I
can<00:02:06.960> tell<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.489> stitches<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
can tell is all the stitches are the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.050 
can tell is all the stitches are the
same<00:02:09.390> size<00:02:09.830> there's<00:02:10.830> no<00:02:11.009> excessive<00:02:11.610> pulling

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
same size there's no excessive pulling

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.370 
same size there's no excessive pulling
up<00:02:12.239> anywhere

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
up anywhere

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.340 
up anywhere
and<00:02:13.470> nothing's<00:02:14.280> dropping<00:02:14.790> off<00:02:15.020> now<00:02:16.020> let's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.770 
and nothing's dropping off now let's
loosen<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.160> tension<00:02:17.610> too<00:02:17.910> much<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.600> what

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
loosen the tension too much and see what

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.610 
loosen the tension too much and see what
happens<00:02:19.400> here's<00:02:20.400> another<00:02:20.790> thing<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.300> check

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
happens here's another thing to check

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.330 
happens here's another thing to check
this<00:02:22.620> spring<00:02:23.040> should<00:02:23.460> be<00:02:23.670> pulling<00:02:24.120> down

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
this spring should be pulling down

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.770 
this spring should be pulling down
significantly<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.880> see<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.240> now<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.630> will

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
significantly as you see it now it will

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.940 
significantly as you see it now it will
look<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.140> little<00:02:28.230> different<00:02:28.380> on<00:02:28.920> different

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
look a little different on different

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.880 
look a little different on different
machines<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.080> not<00:02:31.320> pulling<00:02:31.740> down

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
machines but if it is not pulling down

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.520 
machines but if it is not pulling down
like<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.610> if<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.420> pulling<00:02:33.990> down<00:02:34.020> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
like that if it's not pulling down and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.820 
like that if it's not pulling down and
it<00:02:34.620> looks<00:02:34.830> more<00:02:35.130> like<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:36.000> course<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.650> is

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it looks more like this of course it is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.000 
it looks more like this of course it is
not<00:02:38.070> removing<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.850> slack<00:02:39.120> from<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.570> yarn

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
not removing the slack from the yarn

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.810 
not removing the slack from the yarn
that's<00:02:41.010> terrible

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
that's terrible

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.640 
that's terrible
that's<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.330> make<00:02:42.480> trouble<00:02:42.720> any<00:02:43.050> second

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that's going to make trouble any second

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.880 
that's going to make trouble any second
in<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:45.090> whole<00:02:45.300> function<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> spring<00:02:46.620> is

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
in the whole function of the spring is

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.990 
in the whole function of the spring is
to<00:02:47.820> pull<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.270> slack<00:02:48.720> out<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:50.190> at<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.640> end<00:02:50.820> of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to pull that slack out so at the end of

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.690 
to pull that slack out so at the end of
every<00:02:51.300> row<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.410> could<00:02:52.710> get<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> habit<00:02:53.580> of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
every row you could get in the habit of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.540 
every row you could get in the habit of
testing<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.320> hand<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.100> little<00:02:56.370> bit

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
testing with your hand just a little bit

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.670 
testing with your hand just a little bit
just<00:02:57.150> put<00:02:57.510> your<00:02:57.630> hand<00:02:57.870> over<00:02:58.170> there<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.530> make

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
just put your hand over there and make

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.070 
just put your hand over there and make
sure<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:59.760> it<00:02:59.910> feels<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.360> little<00:03:00.510> bit<00:03:00.780> taut

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
sure that it feels a little bit taut

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.690 
sure that it feels a little bit taut
I'll<00:03:02.070> tighten<00:03:02.520> this<00:03:02.700> back<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.240> from<00:03:03.510> behind

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.200 
anybody who's ever knitted on a bond

machine knows there isn't a tension or
with<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:12.960> can<00:03:13.170> improvise<00:03:13.920> one<00:03:14.460> but<00:03:15.360> at<00:03:15.510> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
with it you can improvise one but at the

end of a Bond row you have to do what
I'm<00:03:17.610> doing<00:03:17.640> with<00:03:18.030> my<00:03:18.060> hand<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:19.260> stop<00:03:19.500> those

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
I'm doing with my hand to stop those

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.980 
I'm doing with my hand to stop those
loops<00:03:20.070> forming<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.790> although<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.540> don't

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
loops forming and although you don't

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.200 
loops forming and although you don't
need<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.770> where<00:03:23.100> attention<00:03:23.610> or<00:03:23.730> exist

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
need to do that where attention or exist

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.110 
need to do that where attention or exist
it's<00:03:25.170> kind<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.680> good<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.130> know<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.580> understand

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
it's kind of good to know and understand

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.570 
it's kind of good to know and understand
what's<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.960> so<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:28.740> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.190> keep<00:03:29.400> an

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
what's going on so that you can keep an

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.910 
what's going on so that you can keep an
eye<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.150> there<00:03:30.360> should<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.780> not<00:03:30.960> any<00:03:31.440> slack

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
eye on it there should be not any slack

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.430 
eye on it there should be not any slack
right<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:32.690> okay<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> haven't<00:03:34.140> actually

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
right there okay I haven't actually

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.400 
right there okay I haven't actually
dropped<00:03:34.950> any<00:03:35.160> stitches<00:03:35.790> yet<00:03:36.060> but<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.110> see

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
dropped any stitches yet but you can see

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.200 
dropped any stitches yet but you can see
that<00:03:37.650> with<00:03:37.830> too<00:03:38.040> loose<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.520> tension<00:03:39.060> I'm

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
that with too loose of tension I'm

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.199 
that with too loose of tension I'm
making<00:03:40.200> bigger<00:03:40.500> stitches<00:03:41.100> along<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.580> edge<00:03:41.760> so

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
making bigger stitches along the edge so

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.860 
making bigger stitches along the edge so
my<00:03:42.810> edge<00:03:43.050> will<00:03:43.320> be<00:03:43.350> sloppy<00:03:43.860> er<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:45.300> keep<00:03:45.630> this

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
my edge will be sloppy er if I keep this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.370 
my edge will be sloppy er if I keep this
up<00:03:45.930> eventually<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:47.400> loop<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.420> yarn<00:03:48.690> will<00:03:49.050> form

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
up eventually a loop of yarn will form

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.490 
up eventually a loop of yarn will form
here<00:03:49.770> and<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:51.060> will<00:03:51.120> get<00:03:51.330> caught<00:03:51.630> as<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.170> try<00:03:52.440> to

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
here and it will get caught as I try to

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.860 
here and it will get caught as I try to
bring<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.310> carriage<00:03:53.670> back<00:03:53.940> across<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.690> might

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
bring the carriage back across it might

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.440 
bring the carriage back across it might
do<00:03:55.050> something<00:03:55.320> like<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:56.000> which<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.180> can't

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
do something like this which you can't

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.270 
do something like this which you can't
see<00:03:57.570> from<00:03:57.930> underneath<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.560> carriage<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.160> it

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
see from underneath the carriage but it

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.120 
see from underneath the carriage but it
makes<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.610> ghastly<00:04:00.060> snarl<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.740> could<00:04:01.920> break

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
makes a ghastly snarl and it could break

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.070 
makes a ghastly snarl and it could break
needles<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:02.970> could<00:04:03.150> damage<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.690> carriage

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
needles and it could damage the carriage

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.830 
needles and it could damage the carriage
so<00:04:04.290> that's<00:04:04.500> something<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:04.950> be<00:04:05.220> avoided<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.970> kept

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
so that's something to be avoided I kept

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.930 
so that's something to be avoided I kept
going<00:04:07.140> with<00:04:07.500> overly<00:04:07.950> loose<00:04:08.190> tension<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:08.910> I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
going with overly loose tension so I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.250 
going with overly loose tension so I
could<00:04:09.209> show<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.420> where<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.900> really

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
could show you where this really

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.949 
could show you where this really
happened<00:04:10.770> I<00:04:10.950> needed<00:04:11.640> back<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.180> forth<00:04:12.480> fast

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
happened I needed back and forth fast

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.910 
happened I needed back and forth fast
and<00:04:13.610> eventually<00:04:14.610> this<00:04:14.940> loop<00:04:15.300> was<00:04:15.540> created<00:04:16.109> so

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
and eventually this loop was created so

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.830 
and eventually this loop was created so
this<00:04:17.070> would<00:04:17.310> certainly<00:04:17.700> make<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.030> messy<00:04:18.570> edge

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
this would certainly make a messy edge

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.710 
this would certainly make a messy edge
now<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.830> could<00:04:20.130> still<00:04:20.400> tie<00:04:20.670> this<00:04:20.730> off<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.540> weave

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
now I could still tie this off and weave

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.260 
now I could still tie this off and weave
it<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.140> but<00:04:22.830> here's<00:04:23.130> what<00:04:23.400> will<00:04:23.520> happen<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:24.120> you

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
it in but here's what will happen if you

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.030 
it in but here's what will happen if you
didn't<00:04:24.660> notice<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.200> because<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.680> was<00:04:25.830> sitting

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
didn't notice it because it was sitting

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.060 
didn't notice it because it was sitting
like<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.370> when<00:04:26.880> I

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
like that when I

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.260 
like that when I
found<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.870> my<00:04:28.870> next<00:04:29.320> pass<00:04:29.560> across<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.940> might

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
found it my next pass across it might

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.360 
found it my next pass across it might
catch<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.200> wheels<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.740> are<00:04:33.010> underneath

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
catch on the wheels that are underneath

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.940 
catch on the wheels that are underneath
the<00:04:33.580> sinker<00:04:34.180> plate<00:04:34.420> here<00:04:35.080> are<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.320> wheels<00:04:35.530> and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
the sinker plate here are the wheels and

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.400 
the sinker plate here are the wheels and
brushes<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:37.150> might<00:04:37.420> catch<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:38.020> loop<00:04:38.200> of

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
brushes that might catch the loop of

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.340 
brushes that might catch the loop of
yarn<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:40.150> can<00:04:40.390> see<00:04:40.660> where<00:04:40.900> actually

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
yarn and you can see where actually

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.560 
yarn and you can see where actually
that's<00:04:41.530> happened<00:04:42.100> this<00:04:42.490> one<00:04:42.700> in<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.940> past<00:04:43.210> and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
that's happened this one in the past and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.420 
that's happened this one in the past and
it's<00:04:43.690> somewhat<00:04:44.080> raggedy<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.830> will

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
it's somewhat raggedy and will

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.960 
it's somewhat raggedy and will
eventually<00:04:46.270> need<00:04:46.420> replacing<00:04:46.560> because<00:04:47.560> of<00:04:47.770> it

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
eventually need replacing because of it

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.550 
eventually need replacing because of it
nobody's<00:04:48.970> perfect<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.630> are<00:04:49.750> occasionally

nobody's perfect you are occasionally

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.950 
nobody's perfect you are occasionally
going<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:51.070> catch<00:04:51.280> loops<00:04:51.670> but<00:04:52.360> as<00:04:52.540> much<00:04:52.780> as

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
going to catch loops but as much as
