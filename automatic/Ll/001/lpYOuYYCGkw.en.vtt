00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.539 
I've no idea how fast that is so they
say<00:02:28.260> we're<00:02:28.410> going<00:02:29.480> 20<00:02:30.480> knots<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.860> would<00:02:32.010> be

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.420 

23.0<00:02:35.549> 16<00:02:36.030> miles<00:02:36.269> per<00:02:36.480> hour<00:02:37.190> 37.0<00:02:38.190> four

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
23.0 16 miles per hour 37.0 four

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
23.0 16 miles per hour 37.0 four
kilometers<00:02:39.000> per<00:02:39.030> hour<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:40.790> 10.2<00:02:41.790> eight<00:02:42.239> nine

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
kilometers per hour and 10.2 eight nine

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.600 
kilometers per hour and 10.2 eight nine
meters<00:02:42.780> per<00:02:42.959> second<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> do<00:02:44.489> that

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
meters per second and you can do that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.580 
meters per second and you can do that
for<00:02:44.880> all<00:02:44.970> these<00:02:45.120> different<00:02:45.360> things<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.440> that

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
for all these different things so that

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.520 
for all these different things so that
is<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> very<00:02:47.070> useful<00:02:48.650> conversion<00:02:49.650> or<00:02:49.799> converter

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
is a very useful conversion or converter

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.400 
is a very useful conversion or converter
the<00:02:52.530> last<00:02:52.709> one<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.430> called<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.570> choose

and<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:57.480> could<00:02:57.690> be<00:02:57.840> useful<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:58.200> some<00:02:58.590> people

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and this could be useful for some people

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.479 
and this could be useful for some people
maybe<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.220> all<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.370> them<00:02:59.489> but<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.860> just<00:03:02.160> pretty

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
maybe not all of them but it just pretty

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.039
