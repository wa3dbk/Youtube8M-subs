PHP Ruby and networking but how about

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.720 
PHP Ruby and networking but how about
databases<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.440> more<00:00:10.650> precise<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.340> want<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
big data being on the rise will be the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.880 
big data being on the rise will be the
future<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.070> Oracle<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.760> Microsoft<00:00:20.880> sequel

into problem a lot of people run into
where<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.079> database<00:00:37.559> job<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
where they think the database job is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
where they think the database job is
about<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> database<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.809> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
about the database so I want to be a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.709 
about the database so I want to be a
database<00:00:40.680> administrator<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.629> they

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
database administrator and then they

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.319 
database administrator and then they
focus<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> database<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.960> my<00:00:45.960> sequel<00:00:47.329> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
focus on the database so my sequel you

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.630 
focus on the database so my sequel you
know<00:00:48.450> no<00:00:49.079> sequel<00:00:49.500> database<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.329> any<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
know no sequel database is any of that

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.979 
know no sequel database is any of that
yeah<00:00:53.640> any<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.120> kind<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> stuff

yeah any of that kind of stuff
Oracle<00:00:55.890> Microsoft<00:00:56.250> sequel<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.239> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Oracle Microsoft sequel so on and so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.290 
Oracle Microsoft sequel so on and so
forth<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.780> focus<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.210> what<00:01:00.210> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
forth so they focus on that and what you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
forth so they focus on that and what you
have<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> understand<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.800> some

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
have to understand is there are some

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
have to understand is there are some
jobs<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.579> there<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.030> pure<00:01:03.390> database

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
jobs out there for pure database

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.039 
jobs out there for pure database
administrators<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.400> generally<00:01:06.119> what<00:01:06.780> people

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
administrators but generally what people

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.109 
administrators but generally what people
are<00:01:07.170> looking<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.280> programmers<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
are looking for is the programmers that

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.429 
are looking for is the programmers that
are<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.540> interacting<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
are going to be interacting with the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.340 
are going to be interacting with the
database<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.490> basically<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.600> creating

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
database so basically you know creating

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.730 
database so basically you know creating
the<00:01:13.770> website<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.500> push<00:01:16.500> or

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the website that is going to push or

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.520 
the website that is going to push or
pull<00:01:17.009> information<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> database

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
pull information to the database

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
pull information to the database
creating<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.770> script<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.000> going<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> go

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
creating a script that is going to go

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.050 
creating a script that is going to go
out<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.750> scrape<00:01:22.200> information<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.790> other

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
out and scrape information out of other

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
out and scrape information out of other
databases<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.560> this

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
databases and then put it into this

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
databases and then put it into this
database<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.570> creating<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.170> mobile<00:01:28.650> app

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
database you know creating a mobile app

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
database you know creating a mobile app
that<00:01:29.369> connecting<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.450> interact<00:01:30.869> with

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
that connecting that can interact with

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
that connecting that can interact with
the<00:01:31.110> database<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.710> basically<00:01:32.159> whenever

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the database so basically whenever

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
the database so basically whenever
you're<00:01:33.540> dealing<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:34.020> databases<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you're dealing with databases or if you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.319 
you're dealing with databases or if you
want<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.490> into<00:01:35.610> databases<00:01:36.030> now

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
want to get into databases now

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
want to get into databases now
essentially<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> do<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.159> learn<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
essentially what you do is you learn a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
essentially what you do is you learn a
programming<00:01:38.759> language<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.869> connects<00:01:40.530> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
programming language that connects to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
programming language that connects to
databases<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.119> from<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.750> if

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
databases and you go from there so if

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
databases and you go from there so if
you<00:01:43.259> want<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> Microsoft<00:01:44.220> world<00:01:44.460> probably

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you want to do Microsoft world probably

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.389 
you want to do Microsoft world probably
something<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.149> c-sharp<00:01:45.829> if<00:01:46.829> you're<00:01:47.100> looking

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
something like c-sharp if you're looking

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.210 
something like c-sharp if you're looking
at<00:01:47.579> my<00:01:48.000> sequel<00:01:48.540> you'd<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.750> looking<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.079> PHP<00:01:49.890> if

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
at my sequel you'd be looking at PHP if

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.350 
at my sequel you'd be looking at PHP if
you're<00:01:50.369> looking<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> no<00:01:50.909> sequel

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you're looking at the no sequel

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.780 
you're looking at the no sequel
databases<00:01:51.829> you<00:01:52.829> would<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.040> looking<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.399> Ruby

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
databases you would be looking at Ruby

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.810 
databases you would be looking at Ruby
something<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.340> go<00:01:56.579> from

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
something like that and you go from

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.490 
something like that and you go from
there<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.030> basically<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.200> need<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
there so basically what you need to be

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.889 
there so basically what you need to be
thinking<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.490> should<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.670> learning

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
thinking about is you should be learning

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.510 
thinking about is you should be learning
programming<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.469> will<00:02:01.799> connect<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
programming that will connect to the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.950 
programming that will connect to the
database<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.600> there<00:02:03.750> aren't

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
database it's not that there aren't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.980 
database it's not that there aren't
database<00:02:04.649> administrator<00:02:05.189> jobs<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.729> there

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
database administrator jobs out there

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.820 
database administrator jobs out there
but<00:02:07.459> there's<00:02:08.459> not<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> whole<00:02:08.700> lot<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> them

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
but there's not a whole lot of them

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.070 
but there's not a whole lot of them
comparatively<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.870> have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
comparatively and you really have

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.870 
comparatively and you really have
to<00:02:13.170> know<00:02:13.350> your<00:02:13.530> stuff<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.040> basically<00:02:14.340> what<00:02:14.850> I

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
to know your stuff so I basically what I

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.420 
to know your stuff so I basically what I
what<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> would<00:02:15.540> argue<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:16.470> learn<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
what I would argue is learn the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
what I would argue is learn the
programming<00:02:18.120> languages<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.930> connect<00:02:19.260> into

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
programming languages that connect into

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.830 
programming languages that connect into
the<00:02:19.500> database<00:02:19.950> create<00:02:20.490> database<00:02:21.060> apps<00:02:21.360> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the database create database apps that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.220 
the database create database apps that
way<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:23.160> you'll<00:02:23.850> be<00:02:24.030> better<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.110> mean

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
way and you'll be better you that I mean

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.630 
way and you'll be better you that I mean
that's<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.470> way<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> go<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.580> if

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
that's a way to go it's like you know if

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.400 
that's a way to go it's like you know if
you<00:02:26.730> look<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.030> big<00:02:27.180> WordPress<00:02:27.720> sites<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.350> you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
you look at big WordPress sites so you

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.530 
you look at big WordPress sites so you
know<00:02:28.740> WordPress<00:02:29.280> connects<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.090> my<00:02:30.210> sequel

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
know WordPress connects into my sequel

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.140 
know WordPress connects into my sequel
databases<00:02:31.670> generally<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.850> don't<00:02:33.000> actually

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
databases generally you don't actually

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.110 
databases generally you don't actually
have<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.450> do<00:02:33.630> any<00:02:33.780> my<00:02:33.990> sequel<00:02:34.350> administration

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
have to do any my sequel administration

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.180 
have to do any my sequel administration
you<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.510> create<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> database<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.890> create

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
you you create the database you create

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280 
you you create the database you create
the<00:02:38.310> user<00:02:38.580> account<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.240> database<00:02:39.690> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the user account for the database you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
the user account for the database you
then<00:02:40.500> feed<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.920> information<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
then feed that information to your to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.110 
then feed that information to your to
your<00:02:42.180> WordPress<00:02:42.930> site<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:44.070> connects<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.820> away

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
your WordPress site it connects and away

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.680 
your WordPress site it connects and away
you<00:02:45.150> go

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
you go

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.960 
you go
every<00:02:46.590> once<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> while<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.430> got<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.700> go<00:02:47.820> in

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
every once in a while you got to go in

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.600 
every once in a while you got to go in
and<00:02:48.180> clean<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.540> stuff<00:02:48.810> up<00:02:49.020> yeah<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:50.280> you

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and clean some stuff up yeah but you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and clean some stuff up yeah but you
know<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.910> type<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> thing<00:02:51.360> where<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.570> have

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
know it's a type of thing where you have

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.420 
know it's a type of thing where you have
a<00:02:51.750> wordpress<00:02:52.110> site<00:02:52.140> up<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.830> year

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
a wordpress site up for a year

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.830 
a wordpress site up for a year
and<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.940> go<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.300> spent<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.630> an<00:02:54.780> hour

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
and you go and you spent like an hour

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.449 
and you go and you spent like an hour
cleaning<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.530> up<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> normal<00:02:56.130> word<00:02:56.250> press

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
cleaning it up for a normal word press

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.670 
cleaning it up for a normal word press
site<00:02:56.490> now<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:57.300> larger<00:02:57.780> sites<00:02:58.050> there<00:02:58.380> are

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
site now with larger sites there are

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.370 
site now with larger sites there are
things<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.370> deal<00:02:59.580> with<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.510> don't

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
things you have to deal with but I don't

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.590 
things you have to deal with but I don't
think<00:03:01.680> you're<00:03:01.770> going<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> get<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.820> job<00:03:03.209> as

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
think you're going to get just a job as

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.560 
think you're going to get just a job as
a<00:03:04.320> sequel<00:03:04.830> anything<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.970> mean<00:03:06.120> again<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
a sequel anything and I mean again a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.199 
a sequel anything and I mean again a
sequel<00:03:07.380> business<00:03:07.980> intelligence<00:03:08.670> developer

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
sequel business intelligence developer

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.400 
sequel business intelligence developer
I'm<00:03:09.270> not<00:03:09.420> even<00:03:09.600> sure<00:03:09.750> what<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.020> hell<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
I'm not even sure what the hell that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.520 
I'm not even sure what the hell that
means<00:03:11.240> I'm<00:03:12.240> not<00:03:12.450> sure<00:03:12.690> where<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.080> got<00:03:13.500> that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
means I'm not sure where you got that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.350 
means I'm not sure where you got that
from<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.620> yeah<00:03:17.300> so<00:03:18.300> I<00:03:18.330> would<00:03:18.510> say<00:03:19.190> learn<00:03:20.360> PHP

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
from so so yeah so I would say learn PHP

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.860 
from so so yeah so I would say learn PHP
or<00:03:22.019> Ruby<00:03:22.080> or<00:03:22.620> learn<00:03:22.950> Oracle<00:03:23.580> or<00:03:23.760> learn<00:03:24.000> C<00:03:24.330> C

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
or Ruby or learn Oracle or learn C C

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.420 
or Ruby or learn Oracle or learn C C
sharp<00:03:24.900> learn<00:03:25.709> something<00:03:26.100> that's<00:03:26.250> going<00:03:26.370> to

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
sharp learn something that's going to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.390 
sharp learn something that's going to
connect<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.970> databases<00:03:27.920> learn<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.070> create

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
connect to the databases learn to create

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.240 
connect to the databases learn to create
apps<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:30.060> connect<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.690> database<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.500> go

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
apps that connect to the database and go

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.890 
apps that connect to the database and go
from<00:03:32.459> there<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:33.180> would<00:03:33.480> be<00:03:33.600> my<00:03:33.720> thought

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
from there that would be my thought

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.060 
from there that would be my thought
because<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.170> hear<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.350> lot<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.650> people<00:03:34.860> are<00:03:34.950> like

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
because I hear a lot of people are like

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.009 
because I hear a lot of people are like
I<00:03:35.250> want<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.550> be<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.700> database<00:03:36.060> admin<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.930> you're

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
I want to be a database admin and you're

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.860 
I want to be a database admin and you're
like<00:03:37.310> probably<00:03:38.310> not<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:39.090> learn

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
like probably not really learn

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.780 
like probably not really learn
programming<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.800> can<00:03:40.980> next<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> database

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
programming that can next to a database

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.580
