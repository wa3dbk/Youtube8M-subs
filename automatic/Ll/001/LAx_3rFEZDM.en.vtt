00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.150 
anybody did anything
I<00:03:41.090> mean<00:03:41.720> realistically<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.950> could

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
I mean realistically I think I could

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.670 
I mean realistically I think I could
have<00:03:43.250> got<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.520> whole<00:03:43.700> table

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
have got the whole table

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.500 
have got the whole table
cuz<00:03:45.680> even<00:03:45.890> if<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.220> saw<00:03:46.610> me<00:03:46.910> doing<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.420> it

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
cuz even if you saw me doing that it

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.210 
cuz even if you saw me doing that it
would<00:03:47.600> take<00:03:47.720> at<00:03:47.870> least<00:03:47.900> five<00:03:48.319> to<00:03:48.350> six<00:03:48.860> seconds

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
would take at least five to six seconds

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.760 
would take at least five to six seconds
to<00:03:49.370> process<00:03:49.970> like<00:03:50.209> did<00:03:50.660> they<00:03:50.840> say<00:03:51.170> could<00:03:51.590> do

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
to process like did they say could do

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.270 
to process like did they say could do
