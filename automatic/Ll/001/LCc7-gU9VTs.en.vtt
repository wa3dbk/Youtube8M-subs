00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.090 

okay

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100 

I<00:00:56.130> was<00:00:56.790> beginning<00:00:56.970> to<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
I was beginning to see that this was a

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.710 
I was beginning to see that this was a
lot<00:00:58.410> harder<00:00:58.739> than<00:00:58.920> I'd<00:00:59.130> ever<00:00:59.160> thought

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
lot harder than I'd ever thought

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.240 
lot harder than I'd ever thought
Claude's<00:01:00.720> hand<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.320> eye<00:01:01.440> coordination<00:01:01.739> has

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
Claude's hand and eye coordination has

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.090 
Claude's hand and eye coordination has
obviously<00:01:02.850> had<00:01:02.970> more<00:01:03.300> training<00:01:03.540> than<00:01:03.720> mine

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
obviously had more training than mine

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.410 
obviously had more training than mine
but<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.339> how<00:01:05.489> hard<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.090> juggling<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:08.420> it's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
but just how hard can juggling be it's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
but just how hard can juggling be it's
really<00:01:09.600> quite<00:01:09.900> hard<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> juggle<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> takes

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
really quite hard to juggle as it takes

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.380 
really quite hard to juggle as it takes
lots<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.240> precision<00:01:12.750> lots<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> concentration
