00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and how they could end up playing out so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
and how they could end up playing out so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
first of all let's just look at the bad

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.560 
first of all let's just look at the bad
side<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.460> stuff<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.150> 60

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.450 
less good
because<00:01:40.660> it's<00:01:40.840> 60<00:01:41.230> frames<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.710> not<00:01:41.830> 30<00:01:42.190> they

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
because it's 60 frames and not 30 they

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.860 
because it's 60 frames and not 30 they
could<00:01:42.610> push<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.940> hardware<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.330> little<00:01:43.630> more<00:01:43.780> if

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
could push the hardware a little more if

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.350 
could push the hardware a little more if
it's<00:01:43.990> 30<00:01:44.170> but<00:01:44.770> really<00:01:45.010> 60<00:01:45.820> frames<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.300> to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
it's 30 but really 60 frames going to

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.480 
it's 30 but really 60 frames going to
make<00:01:46.480> everything<00:01:46.840> crispier<00:01:47.620> response

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
make everything crispier response

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.850 
make everything crispier response
snappier<00:01:49.390> all<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:49.930> stuff's<00:01:50.230> going<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.740> be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
snappier all that stuff's going to be

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.360 
snappier all that stuff's going to be
good<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.430> actually<00:01:52.110> allows<00:01:53.110> for<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> higher

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
good and it actually allows for a higher

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.550 
good and it actually allows for a higher
level<00:01:55.030> of<00:01:55.150> play<00:01:55.660> because<00:01:56.110> you're<00:01:56.260> getting<00:01:56.470> a

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
level of play because you're getting a

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.190 
level of play because you're getting a
lot<00:01:56.710> more<00:01:56.740> information<00:01:57.610> about<00:01:58.080> what<00:01:59.080> is

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
lot more information about what is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.540 
lot more information about what is
happening<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.890> game<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:00.250> might<00:02:00.400> not

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
happening in the game you might not

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.610 
happening in the game you might not
think<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:01.120> would<00:02:01.240> be<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.660> big<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.140> deal<00:02:02.290> but

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
think it would be that big of a deal but

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.670 
think it would be that big of a deal but
it<00:02:02.740> actually<00:02:02.920> does<00:02:03.610> allow<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:05.170> accurate

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
it actually does allow for more accurate

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.260 
it actually does allow for more accurate
shooting<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:06.250> all<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.550> stuff<00:02:06.670> at<00:02:06.970> high

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
shooting and all that stuff at high

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.870 
shooting and all that stuff at high
levels<00:02:07.690> that's<00:02:07.900> why<00:02:08.310> counter-strike<00:02:09.310> players

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
levels that's why counter-strike players

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.300 
levels that's why counter-strike players
and<00:02:10.240> PC<00:02:10.690> competitive<00:02:11.380> players<00:02:11.620> even<00:02:12.070> if<00:02:12.190> they

and PC competitive players even if they

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.740 
and PC competitive players even if they
have<00:02:12.490> hardware<00:02:12.910> that's<00:02:13.120> just<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.540> to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
have hardware that's just going to

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.780 
have hardware that's just going to
destroy<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.740> game<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.100> counter-strike<00:02:15.610> 1.6

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
destroy the game I counter-strike 1.6

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.790 
destroy the game I counter-strike 1.6
this<00:02:16.720> stuff<00:02:16.900> hardware<00:02:17.290> that's<00:02:17.440> just<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
this stuff hardware that's just going to

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.650 
this stuff hardware that's just going to
destroy<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.520> game<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:18.970> obviously<00:02:19.450> it's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
destroy that game like obviously it's

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.050 
destroy that game like obviously it's
like<00:02:19.810> 15<00:02:20.290> years<00:02:20.320> old<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:20.920> point<00:02:20.980> but<00:02:21.790> they

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
like 15 years old at this point but they

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.760 
like 15 years old at this point but they
still<00:02:22.330> turn<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> graphics<00:02:23.260> settings<00:02:23.620> down

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
still turn the graphics settings down

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.180 
still turn the graphics settings down
all<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.670> way<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.150> bottom<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:26.020> max<00:02:26.470> out<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
all the way to the bottom to max out the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.130 
all the way to the bottom to max out the
frame<00:02:27.520> rate<00:02:27.730> everything<00:02:28.240> because<00:02:28.690> every

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
frame rate everything because every

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.360 
frame rate everything because every
single<00:02:29.440> frame<00:02:29.620> helps<00:02:29.980> that's<00:02:30.160> more

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
single frame helps that's more

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.950 
single frame helps that's more
information<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:31.390> you're<00:02:31.510> getting<00:02:31.630> about

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
information that you're getting about

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.410 
information that you're getting about
the<00:02:32.080> game<00:02:32.260> obviously<00:02:32.860> as<00:02:33.190> those<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.850> goes<00:02:34.210> up

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the game obviously as those that goes up

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.320 
the game obviously as those that goes up
it's<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.690> diminishing<00:02:35.560> returns<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.400> what

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
it's like diminishing returns on what

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.760 
it's like diminishing returns on what
you're<00:02:37.450> actually<00:02:37.600> getting<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.590> from

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
you're actually getting but going from

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.220 
you're actually getting but going from
30<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.220> 60<00:02:39.670> s<00:02:39.730> actually<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.270> significant<00:02:41.170> jump

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
30 to 60 s actually a significant jump

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
30 to 60 s actually a significant jump
so<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.890> really<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.610> awesome<00:02:42.790> now<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
so that's really really awesome now the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.620 
so that's really really awesome now the
second<00:02:43.570> thing<00:02:43.890> dedicated<00:02:44.890> servers<00:02:45.300> now<00:02:46.300> this

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
second thing dedicated servers now this

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.780 
second thing dedicated servers now this
is<00:02:46.870> also<00:02:47.080> awesome<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:48.100> there<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.430> some

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
is also awesome but there are some

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.100 
is also awesome but there are some
things<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.239> could<00:02:49.390> be<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.570> little<00:02:49.930> bit

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
things I could be a little bit

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.110 
things I could be a little bit
disappointing<00:02:50.920> about<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.340> if<00:02:51.459> we<00:02:51.760> look<00:02:51.910> at<00:02:52.000> the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
disappointing about it if we look at the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.390 
disappointing about it if we look at the
history<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.630> dedicated<00:02:53.440> servers<00:02:53.770> on<00:02:53.920> console

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
history of dedicated servers on console

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.520 
history of dedicated servers on console
games<00:02:54.580> we<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.150> look<00:02:55.270> at<00:02:55.420> Gears<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.780> War<00:02:55.900> 3<00:02:56.020> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
games we can look at Gears of War 3 and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.410 
games we can look at Gears of War 3 and
they<00:02:56.860> did<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.040> pretty<00:02:57.400> good<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.790> not<00:02:57.970> exactly

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
they did it pretty good but not exactly

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.210 
they did it pretty good but not exactly
perfect<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.170> some<00:02:59.470> people<00:02:59.800> had<00:02:59.950> a<00:02:59.980> lot<00:03:00.190> of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
perfect and some people had a lot of

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.250 
perfect and some people had a lot of
complaints<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.880> they<00:03:00.970> didn't<00:03:01.300> like<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.230> way

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
complaints and they didn't like the way

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.949 
complaints and they didn't like the way
epic<00:03:02.800> handled<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.959> dedicated

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
epic handled it because dedicated

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.440 
epic handled it because dedicated
servers<00:03:05.290> cost<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.770> lot<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.190> money<00:03:06.330> might<00:03:07.330> not

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
servers cost a lot of money might not

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.960 
servers cost a lot of money might not
think<00:03:07.720> about<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.650> cost<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.400> stuff<00:03:09.730> but

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
think about the cost of that stuff but

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.530 
think about the cost of that stuff but
trust<00:03:10.750> me<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.770> does<00:03:12.070> cost<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.790> lot<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.390> only

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
trust me it does cost a lot and the only

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.020 
trust me it does cost a lot and the only
way<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.900> epic<00:03:14.260> could<00:03:15.040> make<00:03:15.370> gears<00:03:15.760> were

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
way that epic could make gears were

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.740 
way that epic could make gears were
three<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:17.170> dedicated<00:03:17.800> servers<00:03:18.750> practically

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
three have dedicated servers practically

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.780 
three have dedicated servers practically
without<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.500> completely<00:03:21.040> losing<00:03:21.520> a<00:03:21.580> ton<00:03:21.730> of

without like completely losing a ton of

without like completely losing a ton of
money<00:03:21.940> was<00:03:22.540> by<00:03:22.750> only<00:03:23.380> allowing<00:03:23.410> people<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.130> use

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
money was by only allowing people to use

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.280 
money was by only allowing people to use
dedicated<00:03:24.850> servers<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.720> have<00:03:25.840> bought<00:03:26.110> in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
dedicated servers that have bought in

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.310 
dedicated servers that have bought in
the<00:03:26.650> most<00:03:26.890> recent<00:03:27.160> DLC<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:28.330> this<00:03:28.510> guarantees

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
the most recent DLC so this guarantees

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.440 
the most recent DLC so this guarantees
that<00:03:29.350> more<00:03:29.830> people<00:03:29.980> will<00:03:30.250> buy<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.489> dlc<00:03:30.790> just

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
that more people will buy the dlc just

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.940 
that more people will buy the dlc just
for<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.750> servers<00:03:32.140> so<00:03:32.290> they<00:03:32.380> get<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.560> little<00:03:32.709> bit

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
for the servers so they get a little bit

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.670 
for the servers so they get a little bit
of<00:03:32.980> money<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.430> way<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.880> also<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.350> sort

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
of money that way and also it can sort

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.290 
of money that way and also it can sort
of<00:03:35.800> split<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> playerbase<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.940> people<00:03:37.209> who

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
of split the playerbase the people who

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.690 
of split the playerbase the people who
are<00:03:37.360> not<00:03:37.570> willing<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.080> pay<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.380> money<00:03:38.800> won't

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
are not willing to pay that money won't

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.970 
are not willing to pay that money won't
be<00:03:39.970> able<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.300> access<00:03:40.450> those<00:03:41.200> servers<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:41.890> they

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
be able to access those servers so they

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.490 
be able to access those servers so they
don't<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> pay<00:03:42.519> for<00:03:42.820> as<00:03:43.300> many<00:03:43.720> now

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
don't have to pay for as many now

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.370 
don't have to pay for as many now
obviously<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.459> lot<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.970> people<00:03:46.090> weren't<00:03:46.750> very

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
obviously a lot of people weren't very

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.780 
obviously a lot of people weren't very
happy<00:03:47.650> about<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.070> because<00:03:48.340> they're<00:03:48.640> like

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
would get dedicated servers

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.200 
would get dedicated servers
I<00:03:53.140> don't<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.500> have<00:03:53.680> dedicated<00:03:54.160> servers<00:03:54.400> now<00:03:55.180> I

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
I don't I have dedicated servers now I

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.610 
I don't I have dedicated servers now I
have<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.630> play<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.050> this<00:03:56.110> peer-to-peer

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
have to play in this peer-to-peer

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.830 
have to play in this peer-to-peer
environment<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:57.880> not<00:03:58.180> as<00:03:58.450> good<00:03:58.690> as<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
environment that is not as good as a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.680 
environment that is not as good as a
dedicated<00:03:59.140> server<00:03:59.740> so<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.910> is<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.210> concern<00:04:01.630> as

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
dedicated server so that is a concern as

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.330 
dedicated server so that is a concern as
well<00:04:01.870> will<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.410> where<00:04:02.740> they<00:04:02.890> might<00:04:03.070> like

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
well will the where they might like

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.430 
well will the where they might like
block<00:04:03.640> off<00:04:03.910> some<00:04:04.180> users<00:04:04.600> from<00:04:04.930> being<00:04:05.200> able<00:04:05.290> to

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
block off some users from being able to

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.770 
block off some users from being able to
play<00:04:05.650> on<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.860> dedicated<00:04:06.040> servers<00:04:06.780> obviously

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
play on the dedicated servers obviously

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.410 
play on the dedicated servers obviously
people<00:04:07.980> could<00:04:08.980> go<00:04:09.190> back<00:04:09.520> and<00:04:09.550> forth<00:04:10.030> like<00:04:10.120> I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
people could go back and forth like I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.450 
people could go back and forth like I
could<00:04:10.690> play<00:04:10.870> with<00:04:10.990> a<00:04:11.050> guy<00:04:11.710> who<00:04:11.770> doesn't<00:04:12.220> have

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
could play with a guy who doesn't have

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.090 
could play with a guy who doesn't have
the<00:04:12.580> DLC<00:04:13.150> obviously<00:04:14.110> not<00:04:14.260> on<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.440> DLC<00:04:14.860> maps

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
the DLC obviously not on the DLC maps

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.580 
the DLC obviously not on the DLC maps
but<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.580> could<00:04:15.970> play<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.690> non<00:04:16.900> dedicated

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
but I could play on the non dedicated

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.020 
but I could play on the non dedicated
server<00:04:17.829> area<00:04:18.250> it's<00:04:18.370> not<00:04:18.519> completely

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
server area it's not completely

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.390 
server area it's not completely
splitting<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.690> user<00:04:19.870> base<00:04:20.200> but<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.890> does

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
splitting the user base but it does

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.520 
splitting the user base but it does
cause<00:04:21.880> some<00:04:22.180> complications<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:23.230> some

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
cause some complications and some

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.680 
cause some complications and some
frustrations<00:04:24.250> within<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.730> community<00:04:25.240> that

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
frustrations within the community that

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.650 
frustrations within the community that
could<00:04:25.960> be<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.140> concern<00:04:26.620> in<00:04:26.890> Halo<00:04:27.280> 5<00:04:27.660> assuming

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
could be a concern in Halo 5 assuming

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.720 
could be a concern in Halo 5 assuming
this<00:04:28.900> game<00:04:29.140> is<00:04:29.290> actually<00:04:29.410> called<00:04:29.740> halo<00:04:29.950> 5<00:04:30.280> but

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
this game is actually called halo 5 but

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.070 
this game is actually called halo 5 but
that's<00:04:31.000> probably<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.360> pretty<00:04:31.390> safe<00:04:31.750> assumption

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
that's probably a pretty safe assumption

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.200 
that's probably a pretty safe assumption
and<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.130> second<00:04:33.640> thing<00:04:33.669> about<00:04:34.030> the

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
and then the second thing about the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.210 
and then the second thing about the
dedicated<00:04:34.630> servers<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.169> this<00:04:35.320> not<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.590> like

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
dedicated servers is this not just like

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400 
it's really not that great like sure
those<00:04:57.760> servers<00:04:58.180> aren't<00:04:58.660> going<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.050> have<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.290> be

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
those servers aren't going to have to be

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.340 
those servers aren't going to have to be
running<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.860> game<00:05:00.130> also<00:05:00.850> those<00:05:01.419> calculations

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
running a game also those calculations

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.350 
running a game also those calculations
are<00:05:02.680> only<00:05:02.919> going<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.400> be<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.640> system<00:05:03.970> it's

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
are only going to be on that system it's

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.240 
are only going to be on that system it's
going<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.660> be<00:05:04.780> more<00:05:04.930> optimized<00:05:05.560> for<00:05:05.710> running

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
going to be more optimized for running

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.500 
going to be more optimized for running
those<00:05:06.370> calculations<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.180> internet

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
those calculations the internet

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.350 
those calculations the internet
connection<00:05:07.990> there<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.350> going<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.770> be<00:05:08.800> better

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
connection there is going to be better

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.760 
connection there is going to be better
so<00:05:10.360> it's<00:05:10.540> going<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.870> be<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:10.990> more<00:05:11.260> quality

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
so it's going to be a more quality

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.130 
so it's going to be a more quality
experience<00:05:12.370> overall<00:05:12.729> but<00:05:13.030> it's<00:05:13.150> not<00:05:13.540> perfect

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
experience overall but it's not perfect

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.600 
experience overall but it's not perfect
you're<00:05:14.290> still<00:05:14.680> going<00:05:14.950> to<00:05:15.010> be<00:05:15.100> getting<00:05:15.250> blood

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
you're still going to be getting blood

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.310 
you're still going to be getting blood
shots<00:05:15.910> that<00:05:16.300> stuff<00:05:16.660> is<00:05:16.840> still<00:05:17.110> being

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
shots that stuff is still being

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.850 
shots that stuff is still being
predicted<00:05:18.280> on<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:19.030> server<00:05:19.300> side<00:05:19.710> so<00:05:20.710> that

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
predicted on the server side so that

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.850 
predicted on the server side so that
stuff<00:05:21.130> isn't<00:05:22.050> necessarily<00:05:23.050> going<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.650> be

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
stuff isn't necessarily going to be

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.250 
stuff isn't necessarily going to be
perfect<00:05:24.340> counter-strike<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.750> still<00:05:26.080> get

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
perfect counter-strike you still get

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.900 
perfect counter-strike you still get
shots<00:05:26.560> where<00:05:26.800> it's<00:05:26.919> like<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.220> totally<00:05:27.729> hit<00:05:27.880> that

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
shots where it's like I totally hit that

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.300 
shots where it's like I totally hit that
guy<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.720> did<00:05:28.930> not<00:05:29.110> register<00:05:29.380> so<00:05:30.130> that's

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
guy and it did not register so that's

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.550 
guy and it did not register so that's
stuff<00:05:30.460> still<00:05:30.729> going<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.060> happen<00:05:31.419> just<00:05:32.380> keep

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
stuff still going to happen just keep

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.900 
stuff still going to happen just keep
that<00:05:32.710> in<00:05:32.770> mind<00:05:33.010> because<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.610> lot<00:05:33.790> of<00:05:33.820> people

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
that in mind because a lot of people

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.060 
that in mind because a lot of people
kind<00:05:34.479> of<00:05:34.510> lose<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.229> they<00:05:35.530> think<00:05:35.590> like<00:05:35.890> oh

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
kind of lose that and they think like oh

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.350 
kind of lose that and they think like oh
it's<00:05:36.280> just<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:36.580> going<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.850> be<00:05:36.910> playing<00:05:37.180> on

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
it's just like going to be playing on

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.510 
it's just like going to be playing on
land<00:05:37.630> right<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.229> it's<00:05:38.320> like<00:05:38.500> not<00:05:38.770> really<00:05:39.280> it's

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
land right and it's like not really it's

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.610 
land right and it's like not really it's
still<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.060> internet<00:05:40.540> it's<00:05:41.200> still<00:05:41.470> not

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
still the internet it's still not

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.460 
still the internet it's still not
perfect<00:05:41.680> but<00:05:42.580> it<00:05:42.729> is<00:05:42.850> better<00:05:43.150> so<00:05:43.600> just<00:05:44.229> keep

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
perfect but it is better so just keep

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.650 
perfect but it is better so just keep
that<00:05:44.530> in<00:05:44.710> mind<00:05:44.950> for<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.220> future<00:05:45.450> now<00:05:46.450> as<00:05:46.540> far

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
that in mind for the future now as far

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.390 
that in mind for the future now as far
as<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.900> positive<00:05:47.350> stuff<00:05:47.470> this<00:05:47.800> stuff<00:05:47.979> just

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
as the positive stuff this stuff just

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.610 
as the positive stuff this stuff just
seems<00:05:49.030> really<00:05:49.330> cool<00:05:49.720> I<00:05:49.780> mean<00:05:49.990> obviously<00:05:50.140> we

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
seems really cool I mean obviously we

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.480 
seems really cool I mean obviously we
didn't<00:05:50.830> see<00:05:51.450> what<00:05:52.450> halo<00:05:52.900> 5<00:05:53.380> has<00:05:53.740> in<00:05:54.100> it<00:05:54.310> like

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
didn't see what halo 5 has in it like

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.710 
didn't see what halo 5 has in it like
what<00:05:54.729> they're<00:05:54.850> really<00:05:55.060> going<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.390> be<00:05:55.479> pushing

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
what they're really going to be pushing

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.210 
what they're really going to be pushing
this<00:05:55.960> hardware<00:05:56.350> to<00:05:56.470> do<00:05:56.620> what<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.890> features

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
this hardware to do what the features

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.030 
this hardware to do what the features
are<00:05:57.550> but<00:05:58.000> you<00:05:58.090> could<00:05:58.240> imagine<00:05:58.270> and

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
are but you could imagine and

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.980 
are but you could imagine and
extrapolate<00:06:00.040> some<00:06:00.070> of<00:06:00.280> the<00:06:00.340> ideas<00:06:00.490> that<00:06:00.990> we're

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
extrapolate some of the ideas that we're

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.900 
extrapolate some of the ideas that we're
coming<00:06:02.200> out<00:06:02.410> of<00:06:02.440> the<00:06:02.650> other<00:06:02.919> demos<00:06:03.430> stuff<00:06:03.760> like

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
coming out of the other demos stuff like

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.239 
coming out of the other demos stuff like
the<00:06:04.150> force<00:06:04.450> of<00:06:04.630> thing<00:06:04.900> where<00:06:05.500> you're

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:06.249 
the force of thing where you're

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:08.909 
the force of thing where you're
pacing<00:06:06.579> and<00:06:06.849> when<00:06:07.239> you're<00:06:07.479> racing<00:06:07.719> it<00:06:08.229> records

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
pacing and when you're racing it records

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.399 
pacing and when you're racing it records
and<00:06:09.339> sort<00:06:09.609> of<00:06:09.699> understands<00:06:10.659> your<00:06:10.749> behavior

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:11.409 
and sort of understands your behavior

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:12.929 
and sort of understands your behavior
and<00:06:11.589> racing<00:06:11.949> and<00:06:12.129> then<00:06:12.219> that<00:06:12.399> gets<00:06:12.549> put<00:06:12.819> into

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939 
and racing and then that gets put into

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.489 
and racing and then that gets put into
the<00:06:13.059> cloud<00:06:13.329> and<00:06:13.569> then<00:06:13.929> when<00:06:14.079> you're<00:06:14.259> racing

00:06:14.489 --> 00:06:14.499 
the cloud and then when you're racing

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.219 
the cloud and then when you're racing
you're<00:06:14.889> actually<00:06:15.129> not<00:06:15.879> racing<00:06:16.299> ghosts<00:06:16.959> of

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
you're actually not racing ghosts of

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.319 
you're actually not racing ghosts of
other<00:06:17.529> people<00:06:17.919> but<00:06:18.459> the<00:06:18.969> AI<00:06:19.269> in<00:06:19.809> that<00:06:20.739> car<00:06:21.549> for

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:22.329 
other people but the AI in that car for

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:25.829 
other people but the AI in that car for
that<00:06:22.449> race<00:06:22.899> is<00:06:23.219> using<00:06:24.219> behaviors<00:06:24.969> from

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
that race is using behaviors from

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:27.989 
that race is using behaviors from
players<00:06:26.439> that<00:06:26.799> have<00:06:26.949> been<00:06:27.099> recorded<00:06:27.489> around

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:27.999 
players that have been recorded around

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.359 
players that have been recorded around
the<00:06:28.269> world<00:06:28.599> in<00:06:28.959> order<00:06:29.319> to<00:06:29.439> make<00:06:29.589> it<00:06:29.769> act<00:06:29.979> like

00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:30.369 
the world in order to make it act like

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.759 
the world in order to make it act like
an<00:06:30.549> actual<00:06:31.059> person<00:06:31.329> and<00:06:31.779> make<00:06:31.929> mistakes<00:06:32.169> like

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:32.769 
an actual person and make mistakes like

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:34.649 
an actual person and make mistakes like
an<00:06:32.919> actual<00:06:33.339> person<00:06:33.609> so<00:06:34.299> that's<00:06:34.479> really

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
an actual person so that's really

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.899 
an actual person so that's really
interesting<00:06:34.899> and<00:06:35.409> makes<00:06:35.649> it<00:06:35.769> so<00:06:35.919> that<00:06:35.949> that<00:06:36.639> is

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
interesting and makes it so that that is

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:39.479 
interesting and makes it so that that is
going<00:06:36.999> to<00:06:37.239> be<00:06:37.329> much<00:06:37.509> more<00:06:37.539> rewarding<00:06:37.929> and<00:06:38.529> then

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:39.489 
going to be much more rewarding and then

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:41.819 
going to be much more rewarding and then
also<00:06:39.639> there<00:06:39.969> was<00:06:40.089> other<00:06:40.360> things<00:06:40.449> about<00:06:41.079> how

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:41.829 
also there was other things about how

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:43.919 
also there was other things about how
you<00:06:41.889> can<00:06:42.099> offload<00:06:42.519> some<00:06:42.909> of<00:06:42.969> the<00:06:43.299> stuff<00:06:43.689> onto

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:43.929 
you can offload some of the stuff onto

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:46.259 
you can offload some of the stuff onto
the<00:06:44.110> cloud<00:06:44.349> how<00:06:44.619> you<00:06:44.679> can<00:06:44.979> connect<00:06:45.399> do<00:06:46.119> all

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:46.269 
the cloud how you can connect do all

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:47.789 
the cloud how you can connect do all
this<00:06:46.449> really<00:06:46.779> interesting<00:06:47.169> stuff<00:06:47.409> and<00:06:47.739> you

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:47.799 
this really interesting stuff and you

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:50.069 
this really interesting stuff and you
get<00:06:47.889> curtains<00:06:48.309> sort<00:06:48.819> of<00:06:48.909> start<00:06:49.089> to<00:06:49.179> see<00:06:49.360> how

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:50.079 
get curtains sort of start to see how

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:51.600 
get curtains sort of start to see how
they<00:06:50.229> could<00:06:50.289> start<00:06:50.559> to<00:06:50.709> implement<00:06:50.919> this<00:06:51.279> stuff

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
they could start to implement this stuff

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.049 
they could start to implement this stuff
into<00:06:51.909> a<00:06:52.389> halo<00:06:52.959> game<00:06:53.169> also<00:06:53.649> just<00:06:54.039> the<00:06:54.309> hardware

00:06:55.049 --> 00:06:55.059 
into a halo game also just the hardware

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:57.539 
into a halo game also just the hardware
power<00:06:55.329> in<00:06:55.689> general<00:06:56.439> we<00:06:56.589> solved<00:06:56.919> that<00:06:56.979> spark

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:57.549 
power in general we solved that spark

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:58.859 
power in general we solved that spark
game<00:06:57.879> where<00:06:58.329> there<00:06:58.509> was<00:06:58.599> all<00:06:58.749> this

00:06:58.859 --> 00:06:58.869 
game where there was all this

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:00.869 
game where there was all this
terraforming<00:06:59.739> stuff<00:07:00.039> really<00:07:00.309> interesting

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 
terraforming stuff really interesting

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.879 
terraforming stuff really interesting
stuff<00:07:01.119> going<00:07:01.149> on<00:07:01.479> there<00:07:01.749> if<00:07:02.169> they<00:07:02.319> could<00:07:02.499> open

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
stuff going on there if they could open

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.379 
stuff going on there if they could open
that<00:07:02.919> sort<00:07:03.549> of<00:07:03.669> stuff<00:07:03.849> where<00:07:04.089> you<00:07:04.209> could

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
that sort of stuff where you could

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.089 
that sort of stuff where you could
change<00:07:04.629> like<00:07:04.869> weather<00:07:05.199> effects<00:07:05.649> basically

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
change like weather effects basically

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.519

area or something and you could just

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:12.359 
area or something and you could just
totally<00:07:10.599> just<00:07:10.779> completely<00:07:11.499> make<00:07:11.889> mountains

transform<00:07:17.949> Forge<00:07:18.929> completely<00:07:19.929> and<00:07:20.110> would

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:20.289 
transform Forge completely and would

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:22.399 
transform Forge completely and would

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:32.339 
past were like PC games or you could
just<00:07:30.759> create<00:07:31.389> anything<00:07:31.689> because<00:07:31.989> you<00:07:32.110> just

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:32.349

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:38.079 
hands um we can start to see that in

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:41.669 
hands um we can start to see that in
Forge<00:07:38.439> which<00:07:38.619> would<00:07:38.860> be<00:07:39.069> amazing<00:07:40.059> so<00:07:40.989> there's

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:41.679 
Forge which would be amazing so there's
