00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.980
 hello girls in this video I will make you 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.019
 see this in the art of making 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.000
 for the month of August I can 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.340
 ensure that the video cannot be seen 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.950
 absolutely fine but live 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.289
 they really shine a lot more 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.309
 both on the thumb and on the ring finger 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.410
 both hands 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:28.540
 I recreated a butterfly in vitro 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.480
 gel painting in many you have me 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.480
 asked and this video can do it for you 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.399
 see naturally to create the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.590
 butterflies on the other hand for me was 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.510
 really, however, a company, anyway 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.420
 really like this result 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.310
 first I take this color that 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.100
 it is of bush, but neither is it magenta 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.110
 I leave you anyway links in the info box and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.800
 with a commercial I am going to outline well 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.860
 the snai line leaving the tip anyway 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.890
 transparent as you see from the video later 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.140
 of which catalyzes then I take these 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.520
 flitter of this color really 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.500
 wonderful I love them and with the tip 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.229
 of the spot I go to take little 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.210
 little little product of the extreme player e 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 I'm going to position it precisely on the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.950
 part where I already made the french 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 then always with the same 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 the spot I take the flipper positions them 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.340
 on france 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.580
 leaving however the transparent tip 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.740
 I really liked the result 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.560
 very much I did not believe to realize it in 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.360
 this way and I also had a 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.370
 very positive feedback for what 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.730
 regards both the butterfly makes and 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.340
 micro-painting that just the whole 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.210
 reconstruction itself I hope anyway 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.210
 you like it too 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:02.570
 however the camber has catalyzed 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.610
 matte is put the top shine with the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.509
 brush point to 0 use this more 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.540
 that the crystal wants to take the gel 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.360
 white the one designed for the decorations 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.790
 micro-painting if you use others 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.430
 you need to catalyze each step 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.739
 because otherwise everything drools instead 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.480
 this is studied on purpose and I go to 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.420
 make the butterfly as you have seen 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.360
 from the video on the ring finger I recorded it 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.269
 but nothing was really visible 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.280
 I hope who you enjoyed is 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.290
 I also send you my idea of ​​nail art 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.410
 a kiss and the next video 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.410
 Hello
