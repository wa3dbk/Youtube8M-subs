00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.550
 hello friends that's good I hope that 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.279
 you are well and we find ourselves for 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.529
 a new mini dedicated to doors 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.910
 and at the windows so wooden door and 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.340
 wooden windows and the same thing in iron 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.750
 so just to do already 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.809
 a good and or what we will need 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.239
 it's not boudons frame I remind you 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.800
 quickly that this airlock is this theme 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.829
 made from boards that we 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.960
 transforms road and play and then 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.399
 wooden plead based wooden would therefore 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.809
 he will make us a good and frame and 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.910
 bolts that can also be found 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.899
 everywhere you get in 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.489
 putting scrap metal in the fire then 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.800
 we do right now a bolt is a 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:59.569
 gooden frame it makes us a good and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 I'm going to make three more 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.909
 directly because I'm going to be able 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.310
 show you the rest of the kraft so bah 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.540
 already we will simply place our 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.880
 first door 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.590
 we can place them where we want so we have to 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.620
 try to be careful 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.300
 how do you place it and so the door 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.050
 in wood that is not very resistant and 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.600
 which can be opened by everyone 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.650
 then to make a wooden window 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.080
 so we will have to always have 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.780
 use an amber door 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.760
 do it and again used the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.710
 bolt coming to add one that makes us 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.580
 one or more buyers is just a species 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.640
 wooden shutters wooden hatches 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.330
 also fits manually 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.710
 as we want the interview ecstasy 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.020
 if it changes something 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.640
 and here we come to ask it that too 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.330
 can be opened by everyone and that 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.880
 makes you a kind of little trap 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.680
 then we will go to the iron doors 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.310
 so the iron doors always in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.689
 making 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.659
 the doors as we saw at the beginning a 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.259
 FREMM a bolt we just reuse it 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.070
 gives a 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.660
 and we just add 3 scrap metal 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.849
 so scrap metal that we find 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.080
 also in different places where 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.050
 I remind you that we can get some 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.489
 putting the stone of a fire there 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.660
 by putting three more a door we have 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.160
 so a gold metal 7 gold metal the same 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 principle we come the place and 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.700
 manually on a location 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.680
 the advantage knows she'll be more 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.660
 resistant and that it will be perceived at 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.610
 staff actually nobody else than 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.220
 you will not be able to open or close it 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.650
 on a server where is played with friends 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.519
 it allows me to make you places 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.959
 secure and private to do next 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.500
 the lahoud n 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.239
 this term metal the shooter pardon on 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.860
 comes we always need a door 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.830
 in iron we use the base so I 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.180
 redo a dozen ok so I come 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.780
 to realize that I was raving 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.430
 completely 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 we want to make a metal shooter so 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.630
 of course it's made from wooden 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.359
 so shoot for that we get a new 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.470
 wooden door with mouden frame and a 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.959
 bolt line a bolt we have one or dance and 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.670
 So we leave this door with 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.350
 a bolt which gives us a taste of 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.940
 buyers 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.950
 ok we are there now we have sudden 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.769
 fall hours we come this time it has 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.310
 added three metal cracks to have 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:26.299
 our metal shooter and the metal shooter 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.389
 same principle that the door I do not 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.760
 do not worry it's decidedly 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:34.069
 definitely a taste of buyers even 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.139
 principle that the door more resistant and 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.420
 his peers' is private so there is that 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.910
 you who could open it 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.889
 that's all for the mini tutor on the 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.299
 doors and sorry for I got 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.280
 confused all by myself but I think that 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.680
 you understood the principle I you 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.250
 find you very soon and wear you 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.250
 well tao zhao
