00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
because there was a new situation new

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.150 
because there was a new situation new
partnerships<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.820> nobody<00:00:54.210> could<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:55.170> how

a big competition nearly every week is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
a big competition nearly every week is
it<00:01:34.080> difficult<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.830> concentrate<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.120> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it difficult to concentrate or do you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
it difficult to concentrate or do you
focus<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.900> different<00:01:36.960> things<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.490> various
