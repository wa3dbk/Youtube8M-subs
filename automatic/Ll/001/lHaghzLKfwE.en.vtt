00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.030 

super<00:01:57.060> power<00:01:57.330> doesn't<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.500> much<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
super power doesn't do that much to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.000 
super power doesn't do that much to
Solomon's<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.940> of<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.270> resistant<00:02:01.010> I'm

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010

Solomon's because of the resistant I'm
good<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.600> really<00:02:03.600> hope<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> parallax<00:02:04.710> here

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
good I really hope for the parallax here

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.160 
good I really hope for the parallax here
and<00:02:06.770> finally<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.760> which<00:02:09.510> is<00:02:09.720> really

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and finally I get it which is really

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.670 
and finally I get it which is really
awesome<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.209> now<00:02:12.209> he's<00:02:12.390> using<00:02:12.420> curse<00:02:13.080> again

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
awesome and now he's using curse again

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.030 
awesome and now he's using curse again
so<00:02:14.430> now<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.520> speed

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
so now is like at the one speed

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880 
so now is like at the one speed
something<00:02:20.040> ridiculous<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.890> it's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
something ridiculous like that it's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.420 
something ridiculous like that it's
probably<00:02:23.780> advert<00:02:24.780> no<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.680> very<00:02:26.160> low

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
probably advert no it's it very low

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.140 
probably advert no it's it very low
helps<00:02:26.850> not<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.830> throw<00:02:28.830> some<00:02:29.220> optimal

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
helps not going to throw some optimal

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.300 
helps not going to throw some optimal
setting<00:02:32.000> see<00:02:33.000> how<00:02:33.209> how<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.989> works<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.560> real

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
care about that just to have revives so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.080 
care about that just to have revives so
we'll<00:03:28.439> go<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> my<00:03:29.069> place<00:03:29.370> again<00:03:29.849> just<00:03:30.299> because

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:55.650 

are<00:03:43.069> almost<00:03:44.069> had<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.390> I'm<00:03:45.390> nor<00:03:45.719> a<00:03:45.749> superpower

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.080 

so<00:03:56.320> we'll<00:03:56.650> throw<00:03:57.190> another<00:03:57.580> alterable<00:03:58.240> at<00:03:58.510> it
