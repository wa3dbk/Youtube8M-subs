 you realize when you are the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 cherry is when he is doing the most 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.489
 sun when summer starts and there it is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.590
 where the cherries come out and like 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.660

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 protect us against the doctor everything 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 It serves for the sun rises when the sun 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 is stronger in the summer then 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.719

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.280
 in this way 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.280
 once 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.190
 do not 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:27.329

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.049
