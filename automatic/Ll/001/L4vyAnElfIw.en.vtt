00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.389
 works hard for peace 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 yes that must grab points she is important and it benefits 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.300
 well 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.330
 so in most cases 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.330
 to get water 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.060
 and today 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.720
 it's 14 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.429
 to put on the map 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:31.609
 that was that for 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.400
 or more but it works 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.750
 I think also experienced to drop out with hits from which one already followed 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 while 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.640
 last year too 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.109
 yes i am of course 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.109
 not bad 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.190
 a good day people are infected his episode nine we defender again 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.450
 as an opponent deetossnel from dordrecht and no who had bitten 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 semester but you can introduce yourself 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.720
 jef and nassau 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.520
 In addition, there have been plays in this trained for a few years 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.560
 jdh one and a half year after year last year half a year let alone one 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.630
 the first set the church has played thirteen games 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 and now these were 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.660
 kpn we are in nijeveen may last year who also played from speijkstraat de 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.170
 church 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.890
 on the images back yes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 but if it turns out he doesn't have any 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.750
 that happened then yes the standard package that also fits in the last nine hectares 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.950
 that was lost 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.810
 d 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.670
 yes it has been adjusted which is a little rivas stuff you go to 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.780
 yes that must grab points she is important and it benefits 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.210
 well 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.250
 so in most cases 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.650
 to get water 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.600
 we noticed that in the past two years 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.469
 the 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.369
 more last week was not too long i still have some players the period before 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.790
 clubs were elsewhere on the boilers 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 yes I mean you trainers change it seems yes yes annoying ma what do you do 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.660
 to it 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.890
 yes we have 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.229
 I have the players who also fill the gap there in Spain 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.979
 that says doctor and he himself and the sheer consultation was that too 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.679
 is better and it just goes on 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.249
 not that I should do better and that is also great Apeldoorn 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.829
 you can get it 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.339
 but this is yellow suspended is what do you think this afternoon against the wall 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.959
 street in this sense 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.630
 every year they better go to the europe cup the bus how do you think how 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.349
 stands for it 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.510
 after it gets spicy out like a good team and I've heard out in between 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.659
 Denmark and hits out what makes it awkward 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.379
 large customers can go there 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 yes that was not there to be seen in the second set I thought the cygnet 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.329
 you know who your personal opponent is 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.389
 and meander refused a little disturbance 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.649
 the tight tasty yes yes that is tricky today is Tuesday continues support 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.739
 by choosing better for opponent no 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.049
 The worst case is Kerkrade being a very nice game Heerenveen had thanked 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.319
 if I have good luck and 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.399
 the cia 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.399
 ever back again at the same time 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.309
 there are after the game against the super fast house next door is also that of 40 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.869
 and how it ended 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.899
 yes we played very well was won with 27 18 was until March this 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.090
 years yes we started well 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.519
 that was it 10 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.609
 yes one immediately 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 caught for a fairly large lead and relinquished north 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:28.709
 you heard your own game against that you think 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.929
 And yes I thought we all started well and sharply and in defense 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:36.620
 where especially the honor was the attacker 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.720
 yes that just want good that salmon and squeeze had had too few chances for me 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 and anvil interceptions and the others Anna Paquin I scored nicely 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.819
 nice with it and yes my own match must say that I have a tough conflict 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.870
 have had it tough 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.299
 match against standard 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.109
 and yes i was done by fans 4 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.189
 and I continued to get that strong and 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:59.200
 both a small fast ladies 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.449
 tennis long crack that became judgments before the game 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.479
 it was two steps would not be sweet that's right 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.450
 and that was a reasonable one I knew a bit 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.319
 You can also do this work so well 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.290
 still got media yes last weekend we were free 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.949
 and if you do too 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.289
 and no no i unfortunately did not have the bilt ketnet in the netherlands on 23 the city 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.000
 on each side years yes it was nice but unfortunately they came in second so that 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.160
 case again less than you can so the Netherlands is not injured but your 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.130
 age category 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.330
 look at annual festivals 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.430
 well that will be good the future 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.600
 And well I hope that in England the ECA will become world champion and different 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.569
 is a lot of people 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:40.650
 European champion 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.029
 yes petercam yes unpack well 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.889
 he pretended she is today giving over to the game became anne floor de 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.639
 second game of peeters how are you now entering the game 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.979
 preparation how was that 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.349
 And there are surely the contest going into the idea that they are especially very hard 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.800
 they could come to us because my invention happened a lot 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.349
 new trainer and 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.229
 well I do fly from they are going to have to play a very hard game 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.379
 also being very hard and not going with him at the time so we did it 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:09.689
 the Hague 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.559
 oh dear boy you can know you can go to the bathroom to play games 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:16.559
 don't sound too much 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.409
 it's all good nonetheless talk driven people do need to call in between 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.509
 today 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:24.159
 it's 14 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:25.229
 to put on the map 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.889
 in May 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.050
 it stands for 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.889
 or more but it works 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.190
 I think also experienced to drop outside the guide from who already followed one 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.820
 while 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.080
 last year too 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.400
 yes I am of course not bad 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.510
 and something was done about it, sweden bought a ticket 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.300
 like tackling the uniform getting stuck 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.499
 daughter 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:52.039

 read the week especially for you 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.510
 religious leader ammar bellamy 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.900
 I personally think that part of it is a fact while two awards were won 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.900
 a hole 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.480

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.529
 beijing 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.210
 especially for you that you can set up on the fans back home naturally beautiful 

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:27.460
 music with it 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.069
 one third another 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.419

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.399
 yes I have a lot of problems with this said I can have beautiful voice 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.199
 to get 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.909

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.439
 and also available in red black 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.789
 I don't know that 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.839

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.259

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.259
 the importance of being drastic 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:11.110
 mika 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.490
 just travel 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.940
 one point in the last four years 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.539
 I was three times glad he lost 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.819
 one time the same as this not with so I now have the feeling 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.159
 I say already as a few weeks what I do not go 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:27.159
 and I know that each of them loses what I play with 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:28.349
 end of message
