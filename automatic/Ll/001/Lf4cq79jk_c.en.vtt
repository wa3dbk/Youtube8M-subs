00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.530
 the league is not finished that is the great 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.299
 owner who left carlo ancelotti in the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.330
 press conference after the match against 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.220
 Barcelona the league is not finished 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.970
 Barcelona has an advantage when 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.550
 we had before football everything 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.460
 can happen is more complicated hand is 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.019
 that at this moment 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.749
 let's give priority to the champions the 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.570
 priority are the same league and 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.220
 champions better in the first part than 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.050
 in the second but this is the line to 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.570
 continue in what's left of the league and 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.920
 champions we are not left with one 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.390
 first part of the match 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 where we have done very well 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.079
 with good control then very effective 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.600
 in front very solid back match what 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.829
 we have done well as I said we have 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.260
 to continue with this with this idea I think 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.019
 that the team has improved a lot in this 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.970
 I felt how good we have done the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.880
 first part we have that we have to 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.780
 follow and try to play like that for 90 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 minutes 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.870
 could be 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.000
 very important to get ahead with marker 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.850
 of that is that we have traced with 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.650
 quality we have had opportunity not 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.720
 we were lucky the first part 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.550
 then also at the beginning of the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.159
 sequences is not had the opportunity 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.540
 to get ahead on the match score 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.550
 of Christian was very complete 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.380
 working hard having many 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.050
 the opportunities provided expert witness 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.010
 faces 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:47.710
 thrown into the goal with danger 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.810
 they look for throw to the arquero what is better 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.170
 have a good feeling about the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.510
 profile of later because now the ones that we 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.230
 failed in recent times I think that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.600
 from there 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.660
 we can have confidence for the next 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.260
 match in the league and also in the 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.260
 champions league
