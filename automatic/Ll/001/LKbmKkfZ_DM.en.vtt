00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.740 
way of handling similar colors but
either<00:01:58.490> way<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.820> face<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> different<00:01:59.570> color

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
either way the face is a different color

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.499 
either way the face is a different color
and<00:01:59.930> has<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.289> black<00:02:00.500> line<00:02:00.829> around<00:02:01.759> it<00:02:02.000> so

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
and has that black line around it so

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.270 
and has that black line around it so
even<00:02:02.840> though<00:02:03.049> it's<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.469> repaint<00:02:03.859> I<00:02:04.039> think

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
even though it's just a repaint I think

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.310 
even though it's just a repaint I think
it's<00:02:04.429> a<00:02:04.869> looks<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.049> whole<00:02:06.289> different

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
it's a looks like a whole different

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.800 
it's a looks like a whole different
figure<00:02:06.920> really<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:08.060> difference<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.720> the

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
figure really the the difference in the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.630 
figure really the the difference in the
paint<00:02:09.050> job<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:09.440> think<00:02:09.530> makes<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.070> really<00:02:10.280> stand

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
paint job I think makes it really stand

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.290 
paint job I think makes it really stand
out<00:02:10.850> in<00:02:11.150> fact

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.480 

and<00:02:16.300> obviously<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.110> same<00:02:17.349> body<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.340> can

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
and obviously it's the same body you can

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.190 
and obviously it's the same body you can
tell<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.849> same<00:02:19.090> mold<00:02:19.390> but<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> figures

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
tell it's the same mold but the figures

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.190 
tell it's the same mold but the figures
that<00:02:20.230> itself<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:22.150> not<00:02:22.239> gonna<00:02:22.450> look<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
that itself it's not gonna look like a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.170 
that itself it's not gonna look like a
plain<00:02:23.860> old<00:02:23.890> figure<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> shelf<00:02:24.880> if<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
plain old figure on the shelf if you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.330 
plain old figure on the shelf if you
have<00:02:25.330> an<00:02:25.480> Indus<00:02:25.930> display<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.950> something<00:02:27.220> like

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
have an Indus display or something like

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.339 
have an Indus display or something like
that<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.580> think<00:02:27.760> it'll<00:02:28.090> stand<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.630> as<00:02:28.870> a

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
that I think it'll stand out as a

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.350 
that I think it'll stand out as a
different<00:02:30.280> character<00:02:30.430> altogether<00:02:30.819> so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
different character altogether so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.540 
different character altogether so
hopefully<00:02:31.690> that's<00:02:32.040> achieved<00:02:33.040> once<00:02:33.400> it's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
hopefully that's achieved once it's

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.190 
hopefully that's achieved once it's
actually<00:02:33.850> on<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> shelf<00:02:34.300> we'll<00:02:34.569> see<00:02:34.870> hopefully

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
actually on a shelf we'll see hopefully

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.070 
actually on a shelf we'll see hopefully
soon<00:02:35.709> sooner<00:02:36.400> rather<00:02:36.550> than<00:02:36.730> later<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.780> there

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
soon sooner rather than later but there

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.430 
soon sooner rather than later but there
