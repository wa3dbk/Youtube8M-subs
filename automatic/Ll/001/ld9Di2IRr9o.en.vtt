00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 
I'm a little nervous cuz I the

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:33.680 
I'm a little nervous cuz I the
first<00:07:11.040> one<00:07:30.890> well<00:07:31.890> the<00:07:32.040> mayor<00:07:32.760> got<00:07:33.030> too<00:07:33.300> excited

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
first one well the mayor got too excited

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.450 
first one well the mayor got too excited
it<00:07:34.050> looks<00:07:34.230> better<00:07:35.040> than<00:07:35.340> the<00:07:35.490> first<00:07:35.520> one

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
it looks better than the first one

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.590 
it looks better than the first one
definitely<00:07:38.460> looks<00:07:38.700> better<00:07:38.790> than<00:07:39.090> the<00:07:39.360> first

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.600 
definitely looks better than the first

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.410 
definitely looks better than the first
one<00:07:39.780> I<00:07:41.570> I<00:07:43.220> can<00:07:44.220> see<00:07:44.430> where<00:07:44.640> I<00:07:44.670> had<00:07:44.970> ripped<00:07:45.210> out

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.420 
one I I can see where I had ripped out

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.050 
one I I can see where I had ripped out
the<00:07:45.660> first<00:07:45.900> one<00:07:46.200> this<00:07:46.770> one<00:07:47.070> doesn't<00:07:47.610> appear<00:07:48.030> to

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 
the first one this one doesn't appear to

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.950 
the first one this one doesn't appear to
be<00:07:48.350> that<00:07:49.350> way<00:07:49.650> so<00:07:49.950> maybe<00:07:50.460> but<00:07:51.360> a<00:07:51.390> little<00:07:51.720> tiny

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
be that way so maybe but a little tiny

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.630 
be that way so maybe but a little tiny
piece<00:07:52.290> of<00:07:52.320> rubber<00:07:52.710> to<00:07:52.920> come<00:07:53.160> off<00:07:53.340> the<00:07:53.490> outside

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:53.640 
piece of rubber to come off the outside

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.250 
piece of rubber to come off the outside
edge<00:07:54.150> so<00:07:55.760> more<00:07:56.760> than<00:07:56.880> likely<00:07:57.090> it's<00:07:57.450> messed<00:07:57.990> up

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.260 
edge so more than likely it's messed up

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.120 
edge so more than likely it's messed up
but<00:07:59.130> we're<00:07:59.670> Fonda
