either one of these areas you just got
out<00:02:08.090> of<00:02:08.119> range<00:02:08.390> right<00:02:08.720> before<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.019> shot<00:02:09.489> go

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
out of range right before I shot go

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.170 
out of range right before I shot go
ahead<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.759> hold<00:02:10.910> up<00:02:11.120> up<00:02:11.330> here<00:02:12.040> crouch<00:02:13.040> down<00:02:13.180> in

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
symbol on the right goes away um once it

goes away you can go down and put this

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.420 
goes away you can go down and put this
more<00:02:27.530> black<00:02:27.739> tail<00:02:27.920> say<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.160> then<00:02:28.250> come<00:02:28.400> back

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
thing with this area is I have had a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.350 
thing with this area is I have had a
glitch<00:02:33.709> out<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.190> where<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.670> doesn't<00:02:35.180> actually

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
glitch out to where it doesn't actually

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780 
glitch out to where it doesn't actually
okay<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.049> now<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.290> can<00:02:36.500> see<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:36.769> gone<00:02:36.950> we'll

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
okay see now you can see it's gone we'll

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.000 
okay see now you can see it's gone we'll
go<00:02:37.849> ahead<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.060> run<00:02:38.180> down<00:02:38.299> there<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.860> only

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
go ahead and run down there the only

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.289 
go ahead and run down there the only
thing<00:02:40.099> with<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.370> area<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.730> I've<00:02:40.879> had<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.180> to

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
thing with this area is I've had it to

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.030 
thing with this area is I've had it to
where<00:02:41.450> even<00:02:41.810> though<00:02:41.989> I<00:02:42.019> come<00:02:42.260> down<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.799> I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
where even though I come down here and I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.280 
where even though I come down here and I
sprinkle<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.579> scent<00:02:43.849> again<00:02:44.000> they<00:02:44.959> never

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
sprinkle the scent again they never

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.930 
sprinkle the scent again they never
actually<00:02:45.590> come<00:02:46.220> back<00:02:46.579> I<00:02:47.410> don't<00:02:48.410> know<00:02:48.590> why<00:02:48.940> but

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
actually come back I don't know why but

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.309 
actually come back I don't know why but
it<00:02:50.090> happens<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.569> way<00:02:50.720> sometimes

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
it happens that way sometimes

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.250 
it happens that way sometimes
so<00:02:52.280> maybe<00:02:53.269> what<00:02:53.569> we'll<00:02:53.690> do<00:02:53.900> we'll<00:02:54.109> try

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so maybe what we'll do we'll try

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.349 
so maybe what we'll do we'll try
something<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> little<00:02:54.950> new<00:02:55.220> put<00:02:55.879> up<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> deer

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
something a little new put up the deer

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.160 
something a little new put up the deer
decoy<00:02:58.030> after<00:02:59.030> we<00:02:59.150> go<00:02:59.599> ahead<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.810> sprinkle<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
decoy after we go ahead and sprinkle the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.530 
decoy after we go ahead and sprinkle the
Black<00:03:00.349> Hills<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.859> we'll<00:03:01.819> go<00:03:02.000> ahead<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.209> pop<00:03:02.329> up

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
Black Hills in we'll go ahead and pop up

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.030 
Black Hills in we'll go ahead and pop up
the<00:03:02.660> deer<00:03:02.900> decoy<00:03:03.109> here<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:05.450> if<00:03:05.569> we<00:03:05.630> can

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the deer decoy here and see if we can

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.710 
the deer decoy here and see if we can
get<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.519> help<00:03:07.639> them<00:03:07.819> bring<00:03:08.030> them<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:08.690> I

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
get that to help them bring them in so I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.080 
get that to help them bring them in so I
don't<00:03:08.870> get<00:03:09.079> it<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.349> glitch<00:03:09.560> out<00:03:09.829> here<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:10.910> it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
don't get it to glitch out here if it

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.839 
don't get it to glitch out here if it
does<00:03:11.269> glitch<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.720> um<00:03:12.280> I've<00:03:13.280> had<00:03:13.489> it<00:03:13.639> to<00:03:13.730> where

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
does glitch out um I've had it to where

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.250 
does glitch out um I've had it to where
it<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.060> keeps<00:03:14.359> doing<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.720> if<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.930> restart

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it just keeps doing it if you restart

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.629 
it just keeps doing it if you restart
from<00:03:15.440> checkpoint<00:03:15.739> because<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.250> gives<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:16.579> a

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
from checkpoint because it gives you a

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.890 
from checkpoint because it gives you a
checkpoint<00:03:16.849> soon<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.329> kill<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> first<00:03:17.810> one

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
checkpoint soon you kill the first one

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.039 
checkpoint soon you kill the first one
or<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:20.120> may<00:03:20.209> be<00:03:20.239> right<00:03:20.510> at<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.690> beginning<00:03:20.810> of

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
or it may be right at the beginning of

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.569 
or it may be right at the beginning of
the<00:03:21.139> hunt<00:03:21.319> either<00:03:21.590> way<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:21.919> still<00:03:22.040> keeps<00:03:22.280> doing

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
the hunt either way it still keeps doing

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.159 
the hunt either way it still keeps doing
it<00:03:22.639> so<00:03:22.880> generally<00:03:23.660> what<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.810> do<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.139> just

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
it so generally what I do is just

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.800 
it so generally what I do is just
restart<00:03:24.829> map<00:03:25.069> just<00:03:25.459> go<00:03:25.609> to<00:03:25.669> pause<00:03:25.910> restart

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
restart map just go to pause restart

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.409 
restart map just go to pause restart
math<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.669> it<00:03:28.669> most<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.480> time<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.870> will<00:03:30.049> fix<00:03:30.319> it

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
math and it most the time it will fix it

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.039 
math and it most the time it will fix it
like<00:03:32.419> I<00:03:32.480> said<00:03:32.840> sometimes<00:03:33.169> it<00:03:33.859> doesn't<00:03:34.130> but

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
like I said sometimes it doesn't but

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.390 
like I said sometimes it doesn't but
most<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.139> time<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.530> will<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.919> I'm<00:03:37.010> not<00:03:37.190> sure

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
most the time it will and I'm not sure

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.589 
most the time it will and I'm not sure
why<00:03:37.639> it<00:03:37.700> does<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:39.109> does<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:40.599> I'm

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
why it does that it just does that I'm

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.530 
why it does that it just does that I'm
not<00:03:41.780> seeing<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.200> other<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:43.329> hopefully<00:03:44.329> he

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
not seeing the other but hopefully he

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.680 
not seeing the other but hopefully he
will<00:03:44.750> come<00:03:45.079> back<00:03:45.910> if<00:03:46.910> he<00:03:47.030> doesn't<00:03:47.359> right<00:03:47.480> away

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
will come back if he doesn't right away

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.379 
will come back if he doesn't right away
we'll<00:03:47.900> try<00:03:48.079> going<00:03:48.380> down<00:03:48.560> there<00:03:48.769> again

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
we'll try going down there again

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.089 
we'll try going down there again
sprinkling<00:03:50.389> some<00:03:50.569> more<00:03:50.780> scent<00:03:51.139> see<00:03:51.769> if<00:03:51.859> we<00:03:51.980> can

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
sprinkling some more scent see if we can

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.460 
sprinkling some more scent see if we can
get<00:03:52.220> him<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.370> come<00:03:52.579> back

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.370 

I've<00:03:58.470> never<00:03:58.710> tried<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.220> deer<00:03:59.490> decoy<00:03:59.730> here<00:04:00.380> I

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
I've never tried the deer decoy here I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.290

one we're gonna go ahead and switch to
muzzle<00:04:22.410> loader<00:04:23.000> here<00:04:24.000> because<00:04:24.930> it's<00:04:25.080> got<00:04:25.230> a

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
muzzle loader here because it's got a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.540 
muzzle loader here because it's got a
little<00:04:25.530> longer<00:04:25.740> range<00:04:26.070> even<00:04:26.430> though<00:04:26.490> you

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
little longer range even though you

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.880 
little longer range even though you
can't<00:04:26.880> use<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:28.110> scope<00:04:28.440> on<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.650> has<00:04:28.860> a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
can't use it the scope on it has a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.830 
can't use it the scope on it has a
little<00:04:29.130> longer<00:04:29.340> range<00:04:29.640> so<00:04:29.910> if<00:04:30.000> there<00:04:30.180> are<00:04:30.510> in

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
little longer range so if there are in

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.970 
little longer range so if there are in
area<00:04:31.230> it'll<00:04:31.500> zoom<00:04:31.830> in<00:04:32.040> on<00:04:32.190> them<00:04:32.750> hopefully<00:04:33.980> I'm

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
area it'll zoom in on them hopefully I'm

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.580
