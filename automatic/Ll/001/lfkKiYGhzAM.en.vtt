00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 very good to all I am 2010 and today I 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.320
 I bring a new video to show you the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.200
 tour of the dragon ball z battle of z that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.720
 I created with the help of quin and greg 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.150
 good as you know is a tool for 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 modify us our 6 data 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 we do not need to have pirate play or anything 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.369
 and well that 's the great advantage that you are 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.260
 to have with my tours is good what 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.360
 first I will explain to you a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 little how do you have to do it since it is 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.840
 a little different than 6 dates from the end 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.870
 fantasy 10 that I hung and the first thing that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.360
 we are going to do is what we always go to 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 put a usb in the play we 're going to 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 come to saved data tools 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.710
 and we are going to copy a game dale 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.710
 we copy it to the usb 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:09.390
 and once copied let's go to the computer 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.390
 to the pc and connect the usb dale 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 connects the connect 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.159
 and once it appears we usb us 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.670
 will have created a folder called ps3 6 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.080
 data is worth as you see the folder is here 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.970
 I am going to minimize it 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.700
 and again we will have to use bruce de 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.250
 force you know you only have to 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.570
 open it is worth to give the three dots 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.100
 from here 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.970
 and we are going to look for the route of the pendrive 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.070
 and say that a ips 36 dates and here is 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.580
 the folder that we want to put the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.280
 tricks 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.810
 this is a game that has just 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.420
 initiated only led I go for mission 2 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.180
 ok we're going to give it to accept here we go 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.549
 to do to select the game button 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.560
 right decrypt everything we give to that 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.020
 yes and when this is green we can 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.630
 start working with the blue 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.520
 now we minimize and here with the blue what 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.490
 only thing that we will have to do is open 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.070
 and data 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.370
 we're going to open it, let's go out again 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.000
 to the route of 6 data 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000
 OK 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.770
 and we select 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.080
 we open here we select in this case 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.380
 the data is worth this is what we are going to 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.620
 modify the data we give to open vale 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.319
 once opened as you see here it appears 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.999
 the route 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.489
 and well, the only thing we will have to do 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:43.969
 it is already apply the tricks unlock to 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.609
 all the characters except those of the 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:49.129
 tlc is that you have to pay them ok since 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:52.010
 I have them activated what happens that if not 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.139
 you have the dlc does not activate it then we 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.609
 activate the rest of the characters all 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.609
 the characters that can be unlocked 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.450
 and unlock all the cards objects and 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.340
 prizes worth 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.800
 I will put him in and try to put him 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.319
 unlock missions to see if I can the 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.180
 updated and nothing once done that 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.129
 we give you to save games like this easy 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.459
 and we will save it with the same name 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.989
 that is to say data point bin is worth the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.840
 extension must also be put on 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.970
 because it's sharp and if you see here it's worth 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.970
 point be to see if you can see it 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.150
 ok we give you save will ask us 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.400
 replace it we say yes once 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.860
 done this is as simple as coming 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.080
 back to the brute force right button 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.510
 about good we select the game 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.250
 we give to yes and it is already we will be able 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.210
 close the group force latour and others 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.580
 it is already simply as it was in the 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.800
 route of the pendrive because we take the 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.400
 pendrive is ok and we go back to the ps3 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.810
 we connect the pendrive to the ps3 we go 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.180
