many different places even aside from
YouTube<00:00:12.480> I've<00:00:12.630> even<00:00:12.929> heard<00:00:13.049> in<00:00:13.309> commentaries

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
YouTube I've even heard in commentaries

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.609 
YouTube I've even heard in commentaries
on<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.490> episodes<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.900> fairy<00:00:16.170> tale<00:00:16.440> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
on the episodes of the fairy tale I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.230 
on the episodes of the fairy tale I
think<00:00:16.890> these<00:00:17.039> blu-rays<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> voice<00:00:17.820> actors

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
think these blu-rays the voice actors

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.120 
think these blu-rays the voice actors
even<00:00:18.449> saying<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> very<00:00:18.960> similar<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.529> one

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
even saying that is very similar to one

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
even saying that is very similar to one
piece<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:21.150> was<00:00:21.240> even<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> joke<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.140> one

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
piece or there was even a joke and one

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.259 
piece or there was even a joke and one
of<00:00:22.680> those<00:00:22.740> commentary<00:00:23.220> saying<00:00:23.430> oh<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.119> it's

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
of those commentary saying oh so it's

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.560 
of those commentary saying oh so it's
like<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.449> fare<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.859> piece<00:00:26.039> ripoff<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.789> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
like a fare of one piece ripoff and to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
like a fare of one piece ripoff and to
be<00:00:27.660> honest<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.279> definitely<00:00:29.279> don't

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
be honest with you I definitely don't

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.840 
be honest with you I definitely don't
think<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.900> ripoff<00:00:31.369> what<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
think that it is a ripoff what I when I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
think that it is a ripoff what I when I
look<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.239> Fairy<00:00:33.480> Tail<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.320> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
look at Fairy Tail what I see is that it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.729 
look at Fairy Tail what I see is that it
was<00:00:34.710> inspired<00:00:35.190> by<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:36.329> pieces<00:00:36.780> design<00:00:37.260> as<00:00:37.680> far

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
was inspired by one pieces design as far

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.060 
was inspired by one pieces design as far
as<00:00:38.520> certain<00:00:38.940> elements<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.079> example<00:00:40.140> for

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
as certain elements like for example for

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
as certain elements like for example for
pretty<00:00:41.370> much<00:00:41.460> every<00:00:41.879> character<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.570> Fairy

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
pretty much every character in Fairy

pretty much every character in Fairy

Tail you can see that there's the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
Tail you can see that there's the
equivalent<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:46.079> piece<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.590> got

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
just fairytale structure it's more

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.369 
just fairytale structure it's more
around<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.539> story<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.989> fairy<00:00:58.170> tale

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
around because the story of fairy tale

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
around because the story of fairy tale
is<00:00:58.530> way<00:00:59.340> different<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> fairy<00:01:00.390> tale<00:01:00.629> is

about magic it's about dragons and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460 
about magic it's about dragons and
whatnot<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.660> piece<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.199> about

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
whatnot and one piece is really about

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.660 
whatnot and one piece is really about
him<00:01:04.680> trying<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> become<00:01:05.250> Pirate<00:01:05.549> King

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
fighting pirates and all that stuff so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
fighting pirates and all that stuff so
it's<00:01:08.220> definitely<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.729> rip<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.060> there<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.330> can

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's definitely not rip up there you can

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.359 
it's definitely not rip up there you can
say<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> character<00:01:10.110> designs<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.680> somewhat

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
say the character designs are somewhat

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
say the character designs are somewhat
similar<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.450> honesty<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.770> me

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
similar but and all honesty it's to me

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.270 
similar but and all honesty it's to me
it's<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.090> heavily<00:01:15.810> inspired

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
it's just really it was heavily inspired

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.649 
it's just really it was heavily inspired
by<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.520> piece<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:17.970> ripped<00:01:18.299> off<00:01:18.479> because

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
by one piece but not ripped off because

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
by one piece but not ripped off because
if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.409> say<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> rip<00:01:19.890> off<00:01:20.070> then

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
if you would say it's a rip off then

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
if you would say it's a rip off then
that's<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.549> saying<00:01:20.729> QB<00:01:21.150> chakra<00:01:21.509> mode<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that's like saying QB chakra mode and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
that's like saying QB chakra mode and
Naruto<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> rip<00:01:22.680> off<00:01:22.830> super<00:01:23.310> saiyan<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
Naruto is a rip off super saiyan or a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.899 
Naruto is a rip off super saiyan or a
gear<00:01:24.750> second<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:26.100> pieces<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> rip<00:01:26.729> off

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
gear second and one pieces of rip off

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.899 
gear second and one pieces of rip off
well<00:01:27.180> kaio-ken<00:01:27.840> from<00:01:28.290> goku<00:01:28.799> they're<00:01:29.579> heavily

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
well kaio-ken from goku they're heavily

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.390 
well kaio-ken from goku they're heavily
inspired<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:31.320> they're<00:01:31.560> not<00:01:31.680> ripoffs<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
inspired but they're not ripoffs and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.800 
inspired but they're not ripoffs and
that's<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> difference<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.780> of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that's the difference because a lot of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.539 
that's the difference because a lot of
people<00:01:34.110> love<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.650> say<00:01:34.740> nah<00:01:34.950> fairy<00:01:35.250> tales

people love to just say nah fairy tales

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.550 
people love to just say nah fairy tales
garbage<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> ripoff<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.140> piece<00:01:37.350> but

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
garbage it's a ripoff of one piece but

where<00:04:42.039> I<00:04:42.069> would<00:04:42.550> say<00:04:42.819> that<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.240> very<00:04:43.660> similar

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
where I would say that is very similar

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.950 
where I would say that is very similar
to<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.949> point<00:04:45.220> where<00:04:45.370> it's<00:04:45.490> like<00:04:45.520> okay<00:04:46.419> maybe

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
to the point where it's like okay maybe

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.779 
to the point where it's like okay maybe
he<00:04:47.470> took<00:04:47.650> inspiration<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> little<00:04:48.430> too<00:04:48.520> far

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
he took inspiration a little too far

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.600 
he took inspiration a little too far
would<00:04:49.660> be<00:04:49.720> guild<00:04:50.080> arts<00:04:50.380> and<00:04:50.620> shanks<00:04:51.340> because

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
would be guild arts and shanks because

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.159 
would be guild arts and shanks because
Guild<00:04:51.849> arts<00:04:52.060> looks<00:04:52.210> like<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.479> Aquila<00:04:52.720> shanks

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
Guild arts looks like that Aquila shanks

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.439 
Guild arts looks like that Aquila shanks

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
um I believe build our times a

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.510 
um I believe build our times a
mechanical<00:04:55.930> arm<00:04:56.110> similar<00:04:56.680> sects<00:04:56.979> not<00:04:57.190> having

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
character design for Guild arts is very

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.339 
character design for Guild arts is very
similar<00:05:02.770> Saints<00:05:03.250> there<00:05:03.639> I<00:05:04.000> don't<00:05:04.900> know<00:05:05.110> really

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
what the case with that but then again

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.300 
what the case with that but then again
if<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.449> was<00:05:07.570> really<00:05:07.720> such<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> ripoff<00:05:08.440> wouldn't

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
yeah he looks like Zdenek oh he's

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.700 
yeah he looks like Zdenek oh he's
identical<00:05:21.909> even<00:05:22.000> missing<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.479> arm<00:05:22.690> but<00:05:22.960> the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
identical even missing the arm but the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.320 
identical even missing the arm but the
Japanese<00:05:24.190> don't<00:05:24.430> see<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:24.789> enough<00:05:25.000> to<00:05:25.150> make<00:05:25.300> a

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
Japanese don't see it enough to make a

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.730 
Japanese don't see it enough to make a
lawsuit<00:05:25.569> about<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:26.050> because<00:05:26.259> something<00:05:26.680> like

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
lawsuit about it because something like

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.990 
lawsuit about it because something like
that<00:05:26.800> would<00:05:27.069> definitely<00:05:27.220> be<00:05:27.460> like<00:05:27.669> they'll<00:05:27.940> be

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
that would definitely be like they'll be

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.480 
that would definitely be like they'll be
sued<00:05:28.300> already<00:05:28.569> so<00:05:29.199> I<00:05:29.229> don't<00:05:29.500> know<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.710> say<00:05:30.310> that

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
sued already so I don't know I say that

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.620 
sued already so I don't know I say that
that's<00:05:30.789> probably<00:05:30.909> one<00:05:31.270> of<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.419> biggest

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
that's probably one of the biggest

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.120 
that's probably one of the biggest
things<00:05:31.930> where<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.169> could<00:05:32.289> say<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:32.710> oh<00:05:32.889> wow

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
things where you could say that oh wow

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.890 
things where you could say that oh wow
you<00:05:33.190> know<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:33.699> very<00:05:33.970> similar<00:05:34.570> but<00:05:34.720> other

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
you know it's very similar but other

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.529 
you know it's very similar but other
than<00:05:35.110> that<00:05:35.169> is<00:05:35.530> like<00:05:35.759> Lucy<00:05:36.759> his<00:05:36.880> own<00:05:37.090> person

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
than that is like Lucy his own person

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.120 
than that is like Lucy his own person
she's<00:05:37.750> nothing<00:05:38.050> like<00:05:38.080> Nami<00:05:38.380> yes<00:05:38.740> she<00:05:38.919> is<00:05:38.949> the

equivalent she's the attractive
fanservice<00:05:42.009> character<00:05:42.159> but<00:05:42.849> she<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.120> not<00:05:43.360> like
