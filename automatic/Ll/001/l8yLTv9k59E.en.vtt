hey everybody if lon Simon and we're
taking<00:00:10.900> a<00:00:11.080> look<00:00:11.200> today<00:00:11.380> at<00:00:11.500> the<00:00:11.980> instant

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
taking a look today at the instant

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.480 
taking a look today at the instant
messenger<00:00:13.330> from<00:00:13.599> tower<00:00:13.929> bag<00:00:14.320> and<00:00:14.710> there<00:00:15.339> is<00:00:15.460> a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
messenger from tower bag and there is a

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.550 
messenger from tower bag and there is a
reason<00:00:16.090> they<00:00:16.210> call<00:00:16.240> this<00:00:16.600> the<00:00:16.750> power<00:00:16.960> bag<00:00:17.230> and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
reason they call this the power bag and

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.040 
reason they call this the power bag and
that<00:00:17.680> is<00:00:17.740> because<00:00:18.190> there<00:00:18.880> is<00:00:19.060> a<00:00:19.090> battery<00:00:19.570> in

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
that is because there is a battery in

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.830 
that is because there is a battery in
the<00:00:20.560> bag<00:00:20.770> and<00:00:21.130> in<00:00:21.280> fact<00:00:21.550> it<00:00:21.790> is<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:21.940> pretty<00:00:22.480> big

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
the bag and in fact it is a pretty big

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.540 
the bag and in fact it is a pretty big
battery<00:00:23.290> too<00:00:23.530> so<00:00:23.770> let's<00:00:23.920> pull<00:00:24.100> it<00:00:24.220> out<00:00:24.340> real

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
battery too so let's pull it out real

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.400 
battery too so let's pull it out real
quick<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:25.270> is<00:00:25.420> stored<00:00:25.780> inside<00:00:25.990> the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
quick it is stored inside the

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.560 
quick it is stored inside the
compartment<00:00:26.800> here<00:00:27.130> it's<00:00:27.310> got<00:00:27.460> a<00:00:27.490> little<00:00:27.640> unit

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
compartment here it's got a little unit

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.850 
compartment here it's got a little unit
attached<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.170> as<00:00:29.260> well<00:00:29.290> and<00:00:29.590> I'll<00:00:29.680> show<00:00:29.800> you

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
attached to it as well and I'll show you

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.680 
attached to it as well and I'll show you
what<00:00:29.980> that<00:00:30.040> does<00:00:30.370> in<00:00:30.490> a<00:00:30.550> minute<00:00:30.790> but<00:00:30.970> this<00:00:31.570> is

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
what that does in a minute but this is

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.870 
what that does in a minute but this is
the<00:00:31.780> battery<00:00:32.110> this<00:00:32.320> is<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.490> 6,000<00:00:33.490> milliamp

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
the battery this is a 6,000 milliamp

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.510 
the battery this is a 6,000 milliamp
battery<00:00:34.240> so<00:00:34.810> it's<00:00:34.960> got<00:00:35.110> a<00:00:35.350> lot<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:35.950> storage

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
battery so it's got a lot of storage

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.890 
battery so it's got a lot of storage
capacity<00:00:37.150> so<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:37.330> think<00:00:37.450> it<00:00:37.660> will<00:00:37.720> probably

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
capacity so I think it will probably

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.720 
capacity so I think it will probably
charge<00:00:38.200> your<00:00:38.350> iPhone<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.710> couple<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.160> times<00:00:39.430> I

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
charge your iPhone a couple of times I

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.970 
charge your iPhone a couple of times I
can<00:00:40.270> also<00:00:40.390> charge<00:00:40.720> iPads<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.500> other<00:00:41.560> devices

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
can also charge iPads and other devices

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.690 
can also charge iPads and other devices
as<00:00:42.370> well<00:00:42.400> so<00:00:42.910> what<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.600> get<00:00:43.780> in<00:00:43.900> here<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:44.700> USB

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
as well so what you get in here is a USB

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.700 
as well so what you get in here is a USB
connector<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.450> this<00:00:46.900> is<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.079> high-powered

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
connector and this is a high-powered

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.069 
connector and this is a high-powered
connector<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.460> will<00:00:48.550> charge<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:49.030> 2.1<00:00:49.690> amps

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
connector so it will charge a 2.1 amps

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.650 
connector so it will charge a 2.1 amps
which<00:00:50.770> is<00:00:50.950> what<00:00:51.130> the<00:00:51.520> ipad<00:00:51.910> charger<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.480> has

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
which is what the ipad charger it has

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.810 
which is what the ipad charger it has
onboard<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.500> it'll<00:00:54.010> charge<00:00:54.190> up<00:00:54.370> your<00:00:54.400> ipad

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
onboard so it'll charge up your ipad

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.700 
onboard so it'll charge up your ipad
presumably<00:00:55.329> off<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.960> battery<00:00:56.380> the<00:00:56.500> same

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
presumably off the battery the same

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.710 
presumably off the battery the same
speed<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.220> will<00:00:57.370> off-the-wall<00:00:57.700> and<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.630> will

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
speed it will off-the-wall and it will

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.330 
speed it will off-the-wall and it will
also<00:00:58.870> charge<00:00:59.260> your<00:00:59.470> iPhone<00:00:59.800> a<00:00:59.829> little<00:01:00.100> quicker

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
also charge your iPhone a little quicker

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.400 
also charge your iPhone a little quicker
if<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.700> plug<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.060> in<00:01:01.180> here<00:01:01.210> now<00:01:01.810> it<00:01:01.960> also<00:01:02.110> has

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
if you plug it in here now it also has

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.170 
if you plug it in here now it also has
two<00:01:02.829> other<00:01:03.070> connectors<00:01:03.730> that<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.940> can<00:01:04.059> use

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
two other connectors that you can use

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.440 
two other connectors that you can use
simultaneously<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.560> has<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.820> regular<00:01:06.820> old<00:01:06.850> iPad

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
simultaneously it has a regular old iPad

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.200 
simultaneously it has a regular old iPad
or<00:01:07.630> iPhone<00:01:08.080> connector<00:01:08.770> right<00:01:08.979> here<00:01:09.040> so<00:01:09.520> that's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
or iPhone connector right here so that's

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.820 
or iPhone connector right here so that's
the<00:01:10.390> standard<00:01:10.570> one<00:01:10.930> however<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.590> of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
the standard one however you can of

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.500 
the standard one however you can of
course<00:01:11.860> get<00:01:12.820> one<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.030> these<00:01:13.150> little<00:01:13.420> guys

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
course get one of these little guys

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.270 
course get one of these little guys
which<00:01:13.870> costs<00:01:14.320> probably<00:01:14.650> as<00:01:14.740> much<00:01:14.890> as<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.130> bag

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
which costs probably as much as the bag

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160 
which costs probably as much as the bag
does<00:01:15.549> unfortunately<00:01:16.240> but<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.810> can<00:01:16.930> put<00:01:17.080> that

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
does unfortunately but you can put that

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.960 
does unfortunately but you can put that
on<00:01:17.350> there<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.770> get<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> thunderbolt<00:01:18.549> connector

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
on there and get a thunderbolt connector

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.030 
on there and get a thunderbolt connector
for<00:01:19.150> compatibility<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.620> have<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.979> to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
for compatibility so you have that to

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.280 
for compatibility so you have that to
play<00:01:21.820> with<00:01:22.030> as<00:01:22.240> well<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.659> again<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:22.900> think<00:01:23.020> if

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
play with as well and again I think if

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.710 
play with as well and again I think if
you're<00:01:23.409> going<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.560> be<00:01:23.680> charging<00:01:24.159> via<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.630> know

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
you're going to be charging via you know

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.090 
you're going to be charging via you know
an<00:01:25.810> Apple<00:01:26.080> device<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.560> would<00:01:26.680> plug<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.979> in<00:01:27.070> here

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
an Apple device I would plug it in here

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.649 
an Apple device I would plug it in here
because<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.670> get<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> little<00:01:28.030> bit<00:01:28.210> more<00:01:28.360> juice

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
because you get a little bit more juice

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.359 
because you get a little bit more juice
out<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.869> that<00:01:29.260> then<00:01:29.680> you<00:01:29.770> will<00:01:29.890> out<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.070> here

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
out of that then you will out of here

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.460 
out of that then you will out of here
this<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> 1<00:01:31.030> amp<00:01:31.180> connector<00:01:31.690> so<00:01:31.960> it'll

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
this is a 1 amp connector so it'll

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.469 
this is a 1 amp connector so it'll
charge<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.979> same<00:01:33.159> speed<00:01:33.549> as<00:01:33.790> the<00:01:33.820> iphones

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
charge the same speed as the iphones

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.899 
charge the same speed as the iphones
wall<00:01:35.200> plug<00:01:35.470> adapter<00:01:35.979> but<00:01:36.670> you'll<00:01:36.760> get<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
wall plug adapter but you'll get a

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.700 
wall plug adapter but you'll get a
little<00:01:37.090> bit<00:01:37.240> more<00:01:37.360> power<00:01:37.600> out<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:37.990> 2.1

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
little bit more power out of that 2.1

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.520 
little bit more power out of that 2.1
amp<00:01:39.299> charging<00:01:40.299> adapter<00:01:40.690> there<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.320> then<00:01:41.440> on

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
amp charging adapter there and then on

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.830 
amp charging adapter there and then on
this<00:01:41.680> side<00:01:41.740> there's<00:01:42.190> also<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.520> USB<00:01:43.270> charging

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
this side there's also a USB charging

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.899 
this side there's also a USB charging
cable<00:01:44.020> too<00:01:44.590> so<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.310> has<00:01:45.460> both<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
cable too so it has both the the

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.850 
cable too so it has both the the
standard<00:01:46.720> enter<00:01:46.930> legis<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.409> mini<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.799> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
standard enter legis the mini and the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.740 
standard enter legis the mini and the
micro<00:01:48.220> USB<00:01:48.729> on<00:01:48.939> there<00:01:49.150> so<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.659> choice

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
micro USB on there so you have a choice

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.230 
micro USB on there so you have a choice
that<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.920> can<00:01:51.100> pick<00:01:51.340> their<00:01:51.580> this<00:01:51.790> is<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.939> little

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
that you can pick their this is a little

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.219 
that you can pick their this is a little
bit<00:01:52.330> lower<00:01:52.510> powered<00:01:52.900> I<00:01:52.960> think<00:01:53.110> this<00:01:53.170> is

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
bit lower powered I think this is

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.859 
bit lower powered I think this is
probably<00:01:53.700> 500<00:01:54.700> milliamps<00:01:54.970> or<00:01:55.420> thereabouts--

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
probably 500 milliamps or thereabouts--

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.770 
probably 500 milliamps or thereabouts--
so<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.439> little<00:01:57.070> less<00:01:57.310> powerful<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:58.240> that's<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
so a little less powerful so that's the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.140 
so a little less powerful so that's the
power<00:01:58.990> component<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.860> there's<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.369> little

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
power component of it there's a little

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.260 
power component of it there's a little
pocket<00:02:01.659> here<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.350> store<00:02:03.070> your<00:02:03.340> iPad<00:02:03.909> or<00:02:03.939> your

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
pocket here to store your iPad or your

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.880 
pocket here to store your iPad or your
tablet<00:02:04.659> device<00:02:05.080> it's<00:02:05.320> got<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.470> nice<00:02:05.650> little

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
tablet device it's got a nice little

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.909 
tablet device it's got a nice little
felt<00:02:06.280> interior<00:02:07.270> there<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:08.169> a<00:02:08.229> little<00:02:08.499> pocket

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:08.919 
felt interior there is a little pocket

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.319 
felt interior there is a little pocket
here<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.459> then<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.579> pretty<00:02:09.879> big<00:02:10.060> wide-open

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
here and then a pretty big wide-open

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.740 
here and then a pretty big wide-open
area<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.529> this<00:02:12.249> is<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.430> power<00:02:12.639> adapter<00:02:12.939> for

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
area here this is the power adapter for

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
area here this is the power adapter for
the<00:02:13.810> battery<00:02:14.110> charging<00:02:14.620> components<00:02:15.070> it's<00:02:15.220> a

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the battery charging components it's a

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.310 
the battery charging components it's a
little<00:02:15.520> bit<00:02:15.640> bulky<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:16.300> you'll<00:02:16.870> need<00:02:17.080> that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
little bit bulky but you'll need that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.110 
little bit bulky but you'll need that
because<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.890> need<00:02:18.070> some<00:02:18.250> power<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.700> charge<00:02:18.940> up

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
because you need some power to charge up

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.910 
because you need some power to charge up
that<00:02:19.240> big<00:02:19.510> battery<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.200> board<00:02:20.470> place

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
that big battery that's on board place

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.710 
that big battery that's on board place
for<00:02:21.100> your<00:02:21.160> business<00:02:21.460> card<00:02:21.730> goes<00:02:21.940> here<00:02:22.270> you

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
for your business card goes here you

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.440 
for your business card goes here you
have<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> little<00:02:23.320> outer<00:02:23.530> pocket<00:02:24.150> here<00:02:25.150> as<00:02:25.300> well

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
have a little outer pocket here as well

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.710 
have a little outer pocket here as well
and<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.930> also<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.260> little<00:02:26.470> felt<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.400> it'll

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and this is also a little felt so it'll

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.880 
and this is also a little felt so it'll
clean<00:02:28.720> off<00:02:28.840> your<00:02:28.870> screen<00:02:29.170> maybe<00:02:29.410> when<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.710> put

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
clean off your screen maybe when you put

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.560 
clean off your screen maybe when you put
it<00:02:29.980> in<00:02:30.070> there<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.370> then<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:31.030> put<00:02:31.240> your<00:02:31.390> laptop

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
it in there and then you put your laptop

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.030 
it in there and then you put your laptop
and<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.140> kind<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.380> like<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.680> because<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.920> was

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
and I kind of like this because I was

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.800 
and I kind of like this because I was
concerned<00:02:33.370> about<00:02:33.610> having<00:02:34.450> this<00:02:34.570> big

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
concerned about having this big

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.080 
concerned about having this big
apparatus<00:02:35.770> here<00:02:35.920> pressing<00:02:36.520> down<00:02:36.730> into<00:02:36.760> my

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
apparatus here pressing down into my

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.940 
apparatus here pressing down into my
macbook<00:02:37.540> these<00:02:37.690> macbook<00:02:38.080> retinas<00:02:38.470> especially

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
macbook these macbook retinas especially

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.430 
macbook these macbook retinas especially
get<00:02:39.130> really<00:02:39.880> sensitive<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.540> pressure<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.290> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
get really sensitive to pressure on the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.710 
get really sensitive to pressure on the
screen<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.760> laptop<00:02:43.120> actually<00:02:43.270> goes<00:02:43.690> into

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
screen so the laptop actually goes into

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.140 
screen so the laptop actually goes into
this<00:02:44.200> padded<00:02:44.680> compartment<00:02:45.280> here<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.060> it'll

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
this padded compartment here and it'll

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.290 
this padded compartment here and it'll
fit<00:02:46.390> up<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.660> 17-inch<00:02:47.290> macbook<00:02:48.190> pro<00:02:48.640> the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
fit up to a 17-inch macbook pro the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300 
fit up to a 17-inch macbook pro the
macbook<00:02:49.690> 15-inch<00:02:50.260> here<00:02:50.470> fits<00:02:50.709> nicely<00:02:51.010> right

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
macbook 15-inch here fits nicely right

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.670 
macbook 15-inch here fits nicely right
inside<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.930> not<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.080> problem<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.500> fact

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
inside so that was not a problem in fact

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.900 
inside so that was not a problem in fact
I<00:02:53.860> was<00:02:53.950> hoping<00:02:54.220> there<00:02:54.340> would<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.520> smaller

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
I was hoping there would be a smaller

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.580 
I was hoping there would be a smaller
one<00:02:55.180> available<00:02:55.480> maybe<00:02:55.959> there<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.410> have<00:02:56.500> to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
one available maybe there is I have to

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
one available maybe there is I have to
look<00:02:56.830> because<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:57.970> really<00:02:58.090> kind<00:02:58.360> of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
look because this is really kind of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.880 
look because this is really kind of
overkill<00:02:58.840> for<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.260> could<00:02:59.410> really<00:02:59.530> go<00:02:59.709> with<00:02:59.860> a

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
overkill for me I could really go with a

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.440 
overkill for me I could really go with a
smaller<00:03:00.100> version<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:00.880> bag<00:03:01.120> will<00:03:01.300> be<00:03:01.420> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
smaller version of this bag will be a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.180 
smaller version of this bag will be a
little<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:01.959> more<00:03:02.170> useful<00:03:02.709> for<00:03:02.890> me<00:03:03.010> because<00:03:03.160> it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
little bit more useful for me because it

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.610 
little bit more useful for me because it
is<00:03:03.370> kind<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.700> big<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.989> is<00:03:05.140> that<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.530> then

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
is kind of big so that is that and then

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.100 
is kind of big so that is that and then
it<00:03:05.709> also<00:03:05.860> has<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.370> ability<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.239> flat

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
it also has the ability to do that flat

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.410 
it also has the ability to do that flat
thing<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.739> get<00:03:08.980> at<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.670> airport<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.360> or

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
thing that you get at the airport so or

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
thing that you get at the airport so or
at<00:03:10.450> least<00:03:10.600> would<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.780> people<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.110> airport

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
at least would be people the airport

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.660 
at least would be people the airport
like<00:03:11.590> for<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:12.010> have<00:03:12.160> which<00:03:12.340> means<00:03:12.550> that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
like for you to have which means that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.510 
like for you to have which means that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
you presumably could put it down flat on

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.250 
you presumably could put it down flat on
the<00:03:15.880> conveyor<00:03:16.180> belt<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:16.690> it'll<00:03:17.020> it'll

device<00:03:25.660> there<00:03:26.140> so<00:03:26.410> that's<00:03:26.590> nice<00:03:26.830> now<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.549> turn

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
device there so that's nice now to turn

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.699 
device there so that's nice now to turn
on<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> bag<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.570> start<00:03:28.810> charging<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.320> just

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
on the bag to start charging you just

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.670 
on the bag to start charging you just
push<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.790> button<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.690> front<00:03:31.810> here<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.440> it

push the button on the front here and it

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.190 
push the button on the front here and it
will<00:03:32.820> boot<00:03:33.820> up<00:03:34.000> essentially<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.900> tell<00:03:35.110> you

will boot up essentially and tell you

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.780 
will boot up essentially and tell you
how<00:03:35.320> much<00:03:35.470> charge<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.830> left<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> battery

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
how much charge is left in the battery

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.400 
how much charge is left in the battery
as<00:03:37.000> well<00:03:37.180> if<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.420> push<00:03:37.600> on<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> again<00:03:38.200> so

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
as well if you push on it again so

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.560 
as well if you push on it again so
there's<00:03:39.160> four<00:03:39.220> marks<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:39.880> here<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:40.269> I've<00:03:40.390> got

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
there's four marks on here so I've got

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.660 
there's four marks on here so I've got
three<00:03:40.840> left<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.890> haven't<00:03:42.010> really<00:03:42.250> charged<00:03:42.519> it

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
three left and haven't really charged it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.400 
three left and haven't really charged it
yet<00:03:42.820> either<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.120> that's<00:03:43.959> how<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.230> works

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
yet either but that's how that works

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.979 
yet either but that's how that works
there<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.070> we<00:03:45.850> could<00:03:46.000> as<00:03:46.120> just<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.570> quick<00:03:46.780> test

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
there so we could as just a quick test

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.960 
there so we could as just a quick test
will<00:03:47.230> plug<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.620> our<00:03:47.769> iphones<00:03:48.640> maybe<00:03:48.880> we'll

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
will plug in our iphones maybe we'll

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.210 
will plug in our iphones maybe we'll
plug<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.299> into<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.660> USB<00:03:50.410> connector<00:03:51.010> there

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
plug it into that USB connector there

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.500 
plug it into that USB connector there
just<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> show<00:03:51.579> you<00:03:51.610> that<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.910> does<00:03:51.940> charge<00:03:52.360> it

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
just to show you that it does charge it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.300 
just to show you that it does charge it
up<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.780> hopefully<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.200> ipad<00:03:53.530> iphone<00:03:53.890> doesn't

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
up and hopefully the ipad iphone doesn't

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.130 
up and hopefully the ipad iphone doesn't
start<00:03:54.579> smoking<00:03:55.299> when<00:03:55.420> i<00:03:55.450> do<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:55.780> here<00:03:55.959> but

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
start smoking when i do it here but

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.680 
start smoking when i do it here but
we'll<00:03:56.860> just<00:03:56.890> plug<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:57.910> by<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.540> way

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
we'll just plug this in and by the way

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.390 
we'll just plug this in and by the way
it<00:03:58.900> does<00:03:59.110> work<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.620> adapter<00:04:00.070> wake<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.340> i

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
it does work that adapter wake like i

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.890 
it does work that adapter wake like i
said<00:04:00.549> before<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.940> does<00:04:01.060> work<00:04:01.360> fine<00:04:01.660> with<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
said before it does work fine with the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.560 
said before it does work fine with the
iphone<00:04:02.230> 5s<00:04:02.739> i<00:04:02.920> just<00:04:03.100> tested<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.549> so<00:04:03.820> that

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
iphone 5s i just tested it so that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.229 
worked and of course i have the wrong
cable<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.070> we'll<00:04:06.190> plug<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.519> into<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.880> ipad

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
cable so we'll plug it into this ipad

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.840 
cable so we'll plug it into this ipad
here<00:04:07.510> and<00:04:08.380> when<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:08.739> do<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.310> will<00:04:09.549> start

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
here and when you do it will start

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.380 
here and when you do it will start
charging<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.660> let's<00:04:11.500> see<00:04:11.739> oh<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:13.120> making<00:04:13.329> me

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
charging and let's see oh it's making me

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.449 
charging and let's see oh it's making me
look<00:04:13.510> bad<00:04:13.709> they<00:04:14.709> turn<00:04:14.920> on<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.130> power<00:04:15.250> adapter

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
look bad they turn on the power adapter

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.340 
look bad they turn on the power adapter
here<00:04:15.940> again<00:04:16.209> see<00:04:16.450> if<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.750> gets<00:04:17.079> us<00:04:17.290> going

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
here again see if that gets us going

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.800 
here again see if that gets us going
there<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:18.040> goes<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.459> i<00:04:18.700> had<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.390> turn<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.570> back

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
there it goes so i had to turn it back

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.110 
there it goes so i had to turn it back
on<00:04:19.959> again<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:21.010> that's<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.400> it's<00:04:21.609> it's

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
on again and that's it and it's it's

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.279 
on again and that's it and it's it's
charging<00:04:22.419> up<00:04:22.630> we're<00:04:22.780> at<00:04:22.870> seventy-nine

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
charging up we're at seventy-nine

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.020 
charging up we're at seventy-nine
percent<00:04:23.440> right<00:04:23.830> now<00:04:23.979> up<00:04:24.160> in<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.310> top<00:04:24.400> here<00:04:24.789> but

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
percent right now up in the top here but

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.480 
percent right now up in the top here but
it<00:04:25.750> did<00:04:25.960> start<00:04:26.349> charging<00:04:26.800> we'll<00:04:26.919> just<00:04:27.099> unplug

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
it did start charging we'll just unplug

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.909 
it did start charging we'll just unplug
plug<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:27.849> back<00:04:27.940> in<00:04:28.120> again<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.569> can<00:04:28.630> see<00:04:28.930> it

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
plug it back in again so you can see it

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.279 
plug it back in again so you can see it
does<00:04:30.099> that<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.310> there<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.699> go<00:04:30.729> so<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.139> is

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
does that and there you go so so that is

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.010 
does that and there you go so so that is
it<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:33.400> instant<00:04:33.940> messenger<00:04:34.810> bag

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
it this is the the instant messenger bag

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.890 
it this is the the instant messenger bag
from<00:04:35.410> power<00:04:35.800> bag<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.669> it's<00:04:37.330> kind<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.509> anything

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
from power bag and it's kind of anything

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.990 
from power bag and it's kind of anything
I<00:04:38.020> think<00:04:38.199> if<00:04:38.289> you<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.430> know<00:04:39.550> if<00:04:39.880> you're

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
I think if you have you know if you're

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.700 
I think if you have you know if you're
away<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> lot<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.960> you're<00:04:41.139> killing<00:04:41.560> the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
away a lot and you're killing the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.290 
away a lot and you're killing the
battery<00:04:42.099> on<00:04:42.280> your<00:04:42.370> device's<00:04:42.940> this<00:04:43.150> is

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
battery on your device's this is

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.850 
battery on your device's this is
probably<00:04:43.539> a<00:04:43.690> pretty<00:04:44.020> good<00:04:44.139> solution<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.710> nice

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
probably a pretty good solution the nice

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.860 
probably a pretty good solution the nice
part<00:04:45.099> is<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.520> battery<00:04:46.120> is<00:04:46.210> integrated

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
part is that the battery is integrated

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.140 
part is that the battery is integrated
inside<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.319> bag<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:48.340> may<00:04:48.550> not<00:04:48.759> be<00:04:49.030> as

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
inside the bag so you may not be as

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.999 
inside the bag so you may not be as
prone<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.660> losing<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.139> as<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.380> would<00:04:50.590> having<00:04:50.949> a

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
prone to losing it as you would having a

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.339 
prone to losing it as you would having a
separate<00:04:51.340> battery<00:04:51.550> it'll<00:04:52.509> charge<00:04:52.720> an<00:04:52.990> iphone

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
separate battery it'll charge an iphone

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.800 
separate battery it'll charge an iphone
couple<00:04:53.740> times<00:04:53.949> actually<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.699> I<00:04:54.729> think<00:04:54.910> you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
couple times actually so I think you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.120 
couple times actually so I think you
know<00:04:55.900> if<00:04:55.990> you're<00:04:56.110> really<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.440> road<00:04:56.919> warrior

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
know if you're really a road warrior

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.830 
know if you're really a road warrior
who's<00:04:57.490> using<00:04:57.729> this<00:04:57.880> phone<00:04:58.090> constantly<00:04:58.509> and

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
who's using this phone constantly and

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.839 
who's using this phone constantly and
away<00:04:59.050> from<00:04:59.259> power<00:04:59.470> it's<00:05:00.340> definitely

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
away from power it's definitely

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.580 
away from power it's definitely
something<00:05:01.419> that<00:05:01.539> might<00:05:01.840> work<00:05:01.990> for<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.289> for<00:05:02.319> me

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
something that might work for you for me

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.920 
something that might work for you for me
it's<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.800> little<00:05:03.069> bit<00:05:03.159> too<00:05:03.310> big<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.729> bulky

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
it's a little bit too big and bulky

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.689 
it's a little bit too big and bulky
because<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:05.020> don't<00:05:05.409> have<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.560> laptop<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:06.250> big

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
because I don't have a laptop that big

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.879 
because I don't have a laptop that big
that<00:05:06.849> I<00:05:06.880> need<00:05:07.030> something<00:05:07.240> this<00:05:07.449> wide<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:08.139> maybe

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
that I need something this wide so maybe

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.140 
that I need something this wide so maybe
they<00:05:09.039> if<00:05:09.220> they<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.460> smaller<00:05:09.759> one<00:05:10.000> that

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
they if they have a smaller one that

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.510 
they if they have a smaller one that
might<00:05:10.300> be<00:05:10.479> more<00:05:10.870> useful<00:05:10.930> but<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:12.009> is<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.310> this

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
might be more useful but that is it this

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.620 
might be more useful but that is it this
