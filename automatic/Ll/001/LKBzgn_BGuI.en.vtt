00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.389

rush

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.830 

okay<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.250> worked<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.379> gravels<00:02:33.379> in<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:35.360> area

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
okay I worked the gravels in that area

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.740 
okay I worked the gravels in that area
in<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.260> center<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:38.140> didn't<00:02:39.140> get<00:02:40.480> very<00:02:41.480> much

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
in the center and didn't get very much

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.280 
in the center and didn't get very much
just<00:02:42.110> very<00:02:42.890> very<00:02:43.250> small<00:02:44.150> flakes<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:47.290> decided

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
just very very small flakes so I decided

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.589 
just very very small flakes so I decided
to<00:02:48.590> dig<00:02:49.280> into<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.849> bank<00:02:50.180> nearby<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:52.569> dug<00:02:53.569> a

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
to dig into the bank nearby I dug a

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.509 
to dig into the bank nearby I dug a
small<00:02:54.140> hole<00:02:54.379> there<00:02:55.780> into<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.840> dirt<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.519> then

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
small hole there into the dirt and then

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.039 
small hole there into the dirt and then
took<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.790> over<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.330> sluice<00:02:59.569> box

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
took it over to the sluice box

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:16.920 
took it over to the sluice box
and<00:03:00.860> came<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.910> with<00:03:01.940> some<00:03:02.239> gravel

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.620 

here's<00:03:17.470> an<00:03:17.650> iron<00:03:17.890> pipe

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
here's an iron pipe

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.700 
here's an iron pipe
that<00:03:20.230> dates<00:03:20.500> back<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:21.180> most<00:03:22.180> likely<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.870> 1930s

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.610 

okay<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.300> small<00:03:47.720> amount<00:03:47.960> of<00:03:48.110> gold<00:03:48.350> here

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
two-piece from the bank most of them

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.120 
two-piece from the bank most of them
that<00:03:59.600> did<00:04:00.170> have<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.410> get<00:04:00.500> some<00:04:00.680> small<00:04:00.920> ones
