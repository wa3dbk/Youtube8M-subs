00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.370 
where the handle is permanent now the
thing<00:01:24.039> I<00:01:24.130> like<00:01:24.310> about<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.759> one<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.329> that<00:01:25.659> the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
thing I like about this one is that the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.480
