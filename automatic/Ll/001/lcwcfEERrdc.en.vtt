00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 your tattoo is how much you have 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.149
 so I have 4 but there are two who 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 are part of the same round they 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 actually incur ok and well listen to you 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 can start there way for 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 change starts with the last 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.870
 yeah we'll say yes that comes from the book 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.539
 and not disney yes sir in 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.010
 the disney dream of everyone is matt this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.049
 tattoo is inspired the illustration of 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.950
 lewis carroll's book actually makes him 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.350
 drew himself 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.810
 okay but she could not make me 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.310
 exactly as in the book in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.689
 before because a thing of books on 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.759
 skin is not there will not be the same 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.049
 and then for a copyright issue 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.689
 she leads there yes it's true 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.000
 kind if you wait 60 years as you can I 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.799
 thought 60 to be 1.81 at right but 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.180
 could not put the same drawing in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 the book the lily she is a little bit 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.840
 smaller and it's not exactly the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 drawing but it's the same thing and you 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.930
 gonna keep you going there is that 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.689

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.710
 alas the rabbit maybe a rose to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 half red spring too well 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.840
 why this universe ben makes me 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.670
 I did not change the rest 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 a little something with my tattoos 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.760
 is that the right arm serves its 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.170
 represent my city 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.080
 the important characters in my life 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 she family etc and the left arm that's 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.730
 the more it's the more the peter pan side does 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.100
 do not want to grow 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.240
 so really mean remembering everything 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.650
 she loved when I was a kid 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
 after that will continue to have some 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.780
 miyazaki it is to see dc comics at 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.970
 harry potter too that's really my 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.010
 arm in the back and this is my arm 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.080
 seriously against that I make them to 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.940
 beaubourg 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.380
 abraxas that i do them in london to 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.230
 camden am not quoted already went to 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.370
 london in camden there are big shock 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.010
 all colors etc 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.440
 there is a big black thing with an angel 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.730
 like that writing dark angels and a big one 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.610
 go downstairs it's a trick all that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 is the whole living room it's a little piece 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.460
 but it 's lettering so I'm 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.800
 said go we have to agree and landed 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.990
 at home if I arrived I never 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.340
 who is doing me now I'm going to take 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.709
 rendezvous by looking at our people we 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.510
 love and a little with best friend 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.950
 it's a good campbell experience in 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.480
 I often go to the ngo I love 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.410
 here I am doing the same in Beaubourg 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.850
 because a haste at war the bac that has me 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.260
 did my first game I like it a lot and 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.720
 so suddenly I went back to the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.590
 see it's a pyramid a little old style 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.520
 school with big lines 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.690
 outer and black and black gradient 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.870
 that old school letter 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.930
 in fact it's complicated then my 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.160
 grandmother is spanish and spanish 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.800
 to tell the grandmother we say ah ben 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.060
 yeah up there that's actually the way 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.530
 childlike to say grandmother celaya actually 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.060
 in my family everyone calls my 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.230
 grandmother there are the parties there is a 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.390
 fifteen years she had gone 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.970
 to live in Cairo in Egypt what so 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.200
 the pyramid never sees it so that's it 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.000
 it's hurt only grandmother I see 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.910
 she never lives there in the land of 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.620
 stones so he stays for yahia and is 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.570
 what she's aware of yeah she's 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.030
 informed and that's when in the beginning 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.590
 I was there when already to talk about it 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.560
 to your parents first one and the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.910
 grandparents generation because 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.940
 it was at the time tattoos it was 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.840
 it was then to death it was badly done in 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.160
 crisis we are 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.750
 finally they are really back then 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.870
 I was in prison by the Russians it's 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.459
 in pen and any game but she sy 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.290
 did not know too much in my family my 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.430
 father and my two also have tattoos 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.959
 and so suddenly when I showed him 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.300
 in fact she was super happy too 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.950
 well yeah that but at first we were 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.780
 crazy why did you do that after 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.870
 short and no but in fact it's too much 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.120
 nice and all to finish my first 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.629
 that I made my 18 years I do them 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.910
 also so 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.260
 abraxas thouars a bunch of the same 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.430
 tattoo called david so that's 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.260
 a wolf like I told you my right arm 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.790
 it's the members of my family and I 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 do them with a little story 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.419
 behind that I can tell one 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.430
 really with a big story the 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.729
 wolf because it's an animal that can 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.990
 to be independent so alone lonely and 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.550
 who can also be in a pack 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.200
 so you blame his friends for his 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.340
 family and all that is the simple trick 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.010
 then the thing 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.039
 the most complicated thing is that my 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.139
 uncle a tattoo of werewolves there and 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.030
 in fact we lose the inhabited part in 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.260
 spain when I was little and I'm 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.699
 a bigger one of my brothers and sisters 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.979
 who did not eat figures 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.410
 masculine enough important 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.630
 except him precisely you who wants to stay 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.130
 in France and so suddenly it's him who 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.930
 a little you took me the big side 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.460
 brother and dad also a little and when 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.600
 I was small in fact he told me that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.090
 I was afraid of his tattoos 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.260
 oh yes yes 3 and super afraid of the werewolf 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.120
 it's a werewolf who like that in 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.650
 to violate it and where and I had parts 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.120
 and tattoos and we were first name it's 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.740
 true apparently the one who told me 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.120
 he promises launched bremen show his 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.349
 tattoos and an old cure it takes 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.160
 do not be afraid because if they are there 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.020
 to protect 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.310
 that's what struck me and then in my 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.900
 family would pay us home we do 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.620
 their first tattoo at 18 on 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.870
 right shoulder 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.460
 ok and he's the one who took me 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.440
 who offered it to me for 18 years 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.210
 so great at your family's level 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.039
 is going very well 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.020
 it's going well because in fact there is 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.150
 only one side that poses a problem 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.590
 it was with an air data because it 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.020
 is ok for me getting stars is 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.520
 everything except that I'm barely 20 years old 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.260
 in two months but I'm barely 20 years old 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.300
 especially at the money level because 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.760
 that kind of downright at Christmas I save 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.680
 for my next tattoo when I type 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.880
 I put a little bit of you I worked 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.710
 in a bar last summer I put 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.900
 money aside for my sleeve at the 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.820
 back and all and she does not understand that 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.720
 in fact she loves my tattoos and where 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.000
 every time I put you 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.550
 here you are there is a process with my 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.570
 mother that my mother is kind of makes me 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.530
 a little bit jaw for two 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.270
 three scenes like to spend all this 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.530
 that I can understand but that's fine 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.330
 and who save to buy judge 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.170
 no clothes stuffs that's for 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.120
 the moment his tattoos 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.400
 thank you very much it was super cool but 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.990
 no problem with you soon maybe 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.380
 world tattoo fair in the world and 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.760

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.760
 it 's salvation
