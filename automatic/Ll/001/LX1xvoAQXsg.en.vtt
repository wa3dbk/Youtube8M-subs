and it's pretty scratched up it's a good

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.580 
and it's pretty scratched up it's a good
idea<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.180> use<00:01:13.300> some<00:01:13.510> protective<00:01:14.020> wrap<00:01:14.229> like

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
idea to use some protective wrap like

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.800 
idea to use some protective wrap like
cellophane<00:01:15.130> tape<00:01:15.159> or<00:01:15.700> clear<00:01:16.090> food<00:01:16.330> wrap<00:01:16.570> to

cellophane tape or clear food wrap to

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.660 
cellophane tape or clear food wrap to
protect<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.200> watch<00:01:17.380> case<00:01:17.680> but<00:01:18.130> since<00:01:18.370> this<00:01:18.520> is

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
protect the watch case but since this is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.039 
protect the watch case but since this is
a<00:01:18.700> practice<00:01:19.120> watch<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:19.690> didn't<00:01:19.900> want

a practice watch and I didn't want

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
a special back opener tool that looks

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.200 
a special back opener tool that looks
like<00:01:41.590> an<00:01:41.740> oyster<00:01:41.860> knife<00:01:42.220> there<00:01:42.880> are<00:01:43.000> several

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
like an oyster knife there are several

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.609 
like an oyster knife there are several
different<00:01:43.570> types<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.080> this<00:01:44.170> one<00:01:44.380> probably

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
different types and this one probably

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.520 
different types and this one probably
isn't<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.100> easiest<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.670> use<00:01:45.850> but<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:46.299> works

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
isn't the easiest to use but it works

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.840 
isn't the easiest to use but it works
with<00:01:47.530> some<00:01:47.740> practice<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.460> stick<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
with some practice you can stick the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.460 
with some practice you can stick the
edge<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.270> opener<00:01:49.630> tool<00:01:49.840> under<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.290> lip

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.679 
edge of the opener tool under the lip
and<00:01:50.650> simply<00:01:51.010> pry<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.280> off<00:01:51.490> an<00:01:51.909> expert<00:01:52.420> can<00:01:52.600> do

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
and simply pry it off an expert can do

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.260 
and simply pry it off an expert can do
this<00:01:52.869> so<00:01:53.020> fast<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.530> like<00:01:53.680> magic<00:01:54.150> inside<00:01:55.150> you

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
this so fast it's like magic inside you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.850 
this so fast it's like magic inside you
can<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> cheap<00:01:56.290> quartz<00:01:56.650> watch

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
can see this is a cheap quartz watch

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.980 
can see this is a cheap quartz watch
with<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.790> movement<00:01:58.180> surrounded<00:01:58.600> by<00:01:58.720> plastic

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
and there's the battery I replaced it

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.210 
and there's the battery I replaced it
not<00:02:01.659> too<00:02:01.810> long<00:02:01.840> ago<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.680> sits<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.100> this

surrounded by tiny metal arms so be

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.119 
surrounded by tiny metal arms so be
careful<00:02:07.720> when<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:07.900> remove<00:02:08.019> it<00:02:08.439> sometimes

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
careful when you remove it sometimes

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
or more gaskets inside so make sure you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.580

don't lose the gaskets and you have them
all<00:02:23.680> straight<00:02:23.980> before<00:02:24.159> you<00:02:24.340> put<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:24.640> case

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
all straight before you put the case

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
back on when replacing the back make

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.410 
back on when replacing the back make
sure<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.129> lip<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.519> oriented<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.239> same

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
sure the lip is oriented in the same

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.780 
sure the lip is oriented in the same
location<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.019> was<00:02:29.140> before<00:02:29.489> sometimes<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
location it was before sometimes the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.610 
location it was before sometimes the
back<00:02:30.970> has<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.329> be<00:02:31.360> correctly<00:02:31.780> oriented<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.440> fit

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
back has to be correctly oriented to fit

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.160 
back has to be correctly oriented to fit
over<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.920> winding<00:02:33.310> stem<00:02:33.610> also<00:02:33.849> if<00:02:34.450> you're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
over the winding stem also if you're

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.600 
over the winding stem also if you're
really<00:02:35.319> lucky<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.829> can<00:02:35.980> press<00:02:36.159> it<00:02:36.310> back<00:02:36.400> on

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
really lucky you can press it back on

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.520 
really lucky you can press it back on
with<00:02:36.760> your<00:02:36.909> hands<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.750> easiest<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.319> best

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
with your hands but the easiest and best

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.319 
with your hands but the easiest and best
and<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:38.980> think<00:02:39.010> safest<00:02:39.609> way<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.760> do<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.120> is

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
and I think safest way to do this is

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.990 
and I think safest way to do this is
with<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.659> press<00:02:41.010> find<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.129> correct<00:02:42.370> dies<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
with the press find the correct dies to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.699 
with the press find the correct dies to
fit<00:02:43.150> over<00:02:43.359> the<00:02:43.450> watch<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:44.290> hollowed<00:02:44.590> out

fit over the watch the hollowed out

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.140 
fit over the watch the hollowed out
diamond<00:02:45.040> was<00:02:45.129> clear<00:02:45.370> over<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:45.730> top<00:02:45.909> of<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
diamond was clear over the top of the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.330 
diamond was clear over the top of the
crystal<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:47.140> have<00:02:47.290> enough<00:02:47.530> bite<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.950> press<00:02:48.159> on

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
the edges of the watch case the backside

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.009 
the edges of the watch case the backside
uses<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.340> flat<00:02:51.549> die<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.060> find<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.690> better<00:02:52.840> to

uses the flat die I find it better to

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.839 
uses the flat die I find it better to
use<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.170> slightly<00:02:53.530> smaller<00:02:53.950> diameter<00:02:54.220> die<00:02:54.609> that

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
use a slightly smaller diameter die that

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.490 
use a slightly smaller diameter die that
just<00:02:55.030> fits<00:02:55.209> inside<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.690> watch<00:02:55.870> back<00:02:56.170> diameter

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
just fits inside the watch back diameter

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.649 
just fits inside the watch back diameter
which<00:02:57.250> helps<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.700> snap<00:02:57.909> it<00:02:58.060> back<00:02:58.090> onto<00:02:58.450> the
