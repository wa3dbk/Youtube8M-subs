we<00:00:27.310> showed<00:00:27.520> the<00:00:27.700> coupe<00:00:28.200> which<00:00:29.200> was<00:00:29.410> already<00:00:29.740> a

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
we showed the coupe which was already a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.479 
we showed the coupe which was already a
kind<00:00:30.789> of<00:00:31.090> predecessor<00:00:31.810> for<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.710> forte<00:00:33.160> that

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
kind of predecessor for the forte that

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.240 
kind of predecessor for the forte that
we<00:00:33.610> see<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.879> first<00:00:34.149> time<00:00:34.329> today<00:00:34.539> and<00:00:35.039> I<00:00:36.039> think

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
we see the first time today and I think

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.920 
we see the first time today and I think
it's<00:00:36.550> very<00:00:36.610> important<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.150> design<00:00:37.600> goes

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
it's very important that design goes

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.560 
it's very important that design goes
with<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:39.190> brand<00:00:39.460> values<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.239> vision<00:00:40.510> of

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
with the brand values and the vision of

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.819 
with the brand values and the vision of
a<00:00:40.720> brand<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:42.460> think<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:44.290> 40<00:00:44.649> is<00:00:44.770> the

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
a brand and I think that the 40 is the

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.760 
a brand and I think that the 40 is the
first<00:00:45.130> car<00:00:45.430> that<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.840> first<00:00:47.079> mass<00:00:47.260> production

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
first car that the first mass production

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.049 
first car that the first mass production
car<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:48.130> really<00:00:48.280> has<00:00:49.059> all<00:00:49.090> that<00:00:49.540> in<00:00:49.989> it<00:00:51.059> you

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.249 
designing the car one of the most

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.580 
designing the car one of the most
important<00:01:30.789> points<00:01:30.969> to<00:01:31.209> us<00:01:31.329> was<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:32.409> it

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
important points to us was that it

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.230 
important points to us was that it
really<00:01:32.740> has<00:01:32.889> a<00:01:32.920> sporty<00:01:33.429> stance<00:01:33.639> on<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.060> wheels

really has a sporty stance on the wheels

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.379 
really has a sporty stance on the wheels
you<00:01:34.359> know<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.689> way<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.679> wheels<00:01:35.889> are<00:01:36.389> placed

you know the way the wheels are placed

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.569 
you know the way the wheels are placed
in<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.719> four<00:01:37.959> corners<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.439> off<00:01:38.709> of<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.399> body

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
in the four corners of off of the body

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.989 
in the four corners of off of the body
so<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.689> real<00:01:40.959> real<00:01:41.560> sporty<00:01:42.520> dynamic

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
stance to it a real important detail for

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:50.219 
stance to it a real important detail for
this<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.579> also<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:49.450> rail<00:01:49.599> defender<00:01:50.139> is

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
this is also the rail defender is

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.019 
this is also the rail defender is
designed<00:01:50.619> this<00:01:50.859> is<00:01:51.039> placed<00:01:51.310> on<00:01:51.490> here<00:01:51.639> so<00:01:51.849> to

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:52.029 
designed this is placed on here so to

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.819 
designed this is placed on here so to
make<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.749> height<00:01:52.959> over<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.409> front<00:01:53.649> wheel

really low and and sporty the overall
silhouette<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.459> course<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.849> important<00:02:01.479> but

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
silhouette of course is important but

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.870 
silhouette of course is important but
there<00:02:02.139> is<00:02:02.229> one<00:02:02.439> detail<00:02:02.829> I<00:02:03.130> really<00:02:03.399> like<00:02:03.579> a<00:02:03.609> lot

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
that comes right out of the a pillar and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.670 
that comes right out of the a pillar and
goes<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:10.300> all<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.690> way<00:02:10.720> through<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.560> the

pipe<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.950> think<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.220> me<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.760> almost<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
pipe I think to me this is almost the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.220 
pipe I think to me this is almost the
best<00:03:25.330> I<00:03:25.540> need<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.870> look<00:03:25.959> at<00:03:26.140> it<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:28.230> with

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
best I need to look at it I think with

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.990 
best I need to look at it I think with
the<00:03:29.440> key<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.769> whatever<00:03:30.010> you've<00:03:30.430> really<00:03:30.700> proved

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the key of whatever you've really proved

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.220 
the key of whatever you've really proved
that<00:03:31.510> key<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:31.810> can<00:03:32.080> make<00:03:32.760> sporty

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that key I can make sporty

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.229 
that key I can make sporty
characteristics<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.380> 10<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.880> c-segment

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
characteristics a 10 in the c-segment

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.380 
characteristics a 10 in the c-segment
and<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.959> think<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.530> C<00:03:38.709> segment<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.220> very<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.760> very

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
and I think the C segment is very a very

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.410 
and I think the C segment is very a very
important<00:03:40.780> segment<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.700> 40<00:03:43.060> will<00:03:43.209> be<00:03:43.390> a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
important segment and the 40 will be a

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.170 
important segment and the 40 will be a
challenger<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.170> there<00:03:45.070> is<00:03:45.190> even<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.640> lot<00:03:45.910> more

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
challenger and there is even a lot more

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.170 
challenger and there is even a lot more
to<00:03:46.329> come

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.370
