to signal to the lady to make a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.120 
to signal to the lady to make a
clockwise<00:02:16.300> turn<00:02:16.750> another<00:02:17.500> way<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.770> saying<00:02:17.950> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
clockwise turn another way of saying the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.540 
clockwise turn another way of saying the
same

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
same

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.640 
same
after<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.180> let<00:02:19.360> her<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:19.660> take<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.350> hand

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
after you let her go take this hand

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.250 
after you let her go take this hand
behind<00:02:20.860> her<00:02:21.340> head<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:22.270> will<00:02:22.450> signal<00:02:22.900> her<00:02:23.080> to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
behind her head that will signal her to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.890 
behind her head that will signal her to
move<00:02:23.530> around<00:02:23.740> in<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.520> direction<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:25.630> never

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
move around in that direction you never

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.050 
move around in that direction you never
want<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.230> bring<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.650> hand<00:02:26.950> across<00:02:27.400> her<00:02:27.730> face

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
want to bring the hand across her face

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360 
want to bring the hand across her face
if<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.990> bring<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.350> hand<00:02:29.560> across<00:02:29.830> her<00:02:30.100> face

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
if you bring the hand across her face

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.490 
if you bring the hand across her face
that's<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.180> make<00:02:31.360> her<00:02:31.540> try<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.200> turn

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
that's going to make her try to turn

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.710 
that's going to make her try to turn
counterclockwise<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.880> that's<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
counterclockwise and that's not going to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.480 
counterclockwise and that's not going to
work<00:02:35.020> someone's<00:02:35.710> just<00:02:35.860> going<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.070> get<00:02:36.190> stepped

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
work someone's just going to get stepped

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.120 
work someone's just going to get stepped
on<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.630> do<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.990> gentleman<00:02:38.440> as<00:02:38.590> we<00:02:38.950> dance

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
on so we do this gentleman as we dance

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.880 
on so we do this gentleman as we dance
step<00:02:39.580> four<00:02:39.970> now<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.540> easy<00:02:40.930> thing<00:02:41.350> here<00:02:41.770> is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
step four now the easy thing here is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.390 
step four now the easy thing here is
that<00:02:42.310> our<00:02:42.370> steps<00:02:42.970> do<00:02:43.330> not<00:02:43.570> change<00:02:44.050> per<00:02:44.440> se<00:02:44.740> but

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that our steps do not change per se but

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.450 
that our steps do not change per se but
we<00:02:45.670> must<00:02:46.060> minimize<00:02:46.810> our<00:02:47.290> steps<00:02:47.710> we<00:02:48.130> can't

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
we must minimize our steps we can't

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.150 
we must minimize our steps we can't
treat<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.940> as<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.360> would<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.810> normal<00:02:50.380> box<00:02:50.860> step

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
treat it as we would a normal box step

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.160 
treat it as we would a normal box step
let<00:02:51.520> me<00:02:51.610> just<00:02:51.790> turn<00:02:51.910> my<00:02:52.090> back<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.570> to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
let me just turn my back to you to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.870 
let me just turn my back to you to
demonstrate<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.130> step<00:02:54.310> for<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.550> once<00:02:54.760> again

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
demonstrate this step for you once again

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.040 
demonstrate this step for you once again
noticing<00:02:55.870> my<00:02:56.050> feet<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.470> time<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:57.040> go<00:02:57.490> one<00:02:57.850> two

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
noticing my feet this time I go one two

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.980 
noticing my feet this time I go one two
three<00:02:59.250> four<00:03:00.250> five<00:03:01.060> six<00:03:01.840> one<00:03:02.650> two<00:03:03.300> three<00:03:04.300> four

three four five six one two three four

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.800 
three four five six one two three four
five<00:03:05.740> six<00:03:06.490> now<00:03:06.940> I'll<00:03:07.060> do<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.270> same<00:03:07.390> thing

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
five six now I'll do the same thing

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.930 
five six now I'll do the same thing
again<00:03:07.960> but<00:03:08.800> I'm<00:03:08.980> going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.280> be<00:03:09.430> oblivious<00:03:09.910> to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
again but I'm going to be oblivious to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.850 
again but I'm going to be oblivious to
the<00:03:10.180> lady<00:03:10.390> I'm<00:03:10.600> going<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.870> dance<00:03:11.050> my<00:03:11.350> steps<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the lady I'm going to dance my steps the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.640 
the lady I'm going to dance my steps the
same<00:03:12.130> no<00:03:12.400> matter<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.850> I'll<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.660> one<00:03:13.960> two

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
same no matter what I'll go one two

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
three four five six one two three four

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.480 
three four five six one two three four
five<00:03:21.160> six<00:03:21.850> as<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.660> do<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:23.170> bad<00:03:23.740> things<00:03:24.070> happen

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
five six as I do that bad things happen

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.670 
five six as I do that bad things happen
when<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.970> get<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.540> four<00:03:25.750> five<00:03:25.959> six<00:03:26.260> I'm<00:03:26.470> in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
when I get to the four five six I'm in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.040 
when I get to the four five six I'm in
her<00:03:26.980> way<00:03:27.280> she<00:03:27.760> can't<00:03:28.090> dance<00:03:28.390> her<00:03:28.690> steps

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
her way she can't dance her steps

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.960 
her way she can't dance her steps
through<00:03:29.410> without<00:03:29.980> feeling<00:03:30.490> she's<00:03:30.670> going<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
through without feeling she's going to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.360 
through without feeling she's going to
step<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.360> me<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.750> vice<00:03:32.200> versa<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.680> can't<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.160> my

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
step on me and vice versa I can't do my

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.250 
step on me and vice versa I can't do my
steps<00:03:33.700> without<00:03:34.150> feeling<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.720> I'm<00:03:34.840> going<00:03:35.200> to

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
steps without feeling that I'm going to

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.090 
steps without feeling that I'm going to
step<00:03:35.530> on<00:03:35.709> Eva

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
step on Eva

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.980 
step on Eva
so<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.760> trick<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.180> if<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.420> do<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.660> once<00:03:37.870> again

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
so the trick is if I do it once again

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.500 
so the trick is if I do it once again
and<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.350> notice<00:03:38.680> my<00:03:38.860> steps<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.180> best<00:03:40.360> way

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
and you notice my steps and the best way

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.300 
and you notice my steps and the best way
to<00:03:40.540> think<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.200> on<00:03:41.380> all<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.070> four

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
to think of it is on all of the four

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.000 
to think of it is on all of the four
five<00:03:42.550> six<00:03:42.910> six<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.990> you're<00:03:44.140> going<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.350> minimize

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
five six six is you're going to minimize
