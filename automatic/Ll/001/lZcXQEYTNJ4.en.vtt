hello guys this is MTN team and I'm back
in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> snapshot<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:36.000> show<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.750> new

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
in the snapshot to show you this new

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740 
in the snapshot to show you this new
concept<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.600> be

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
concept that I have it actually can be

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.319 
concept that I have it actually can be
recreated<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.290> 1.6<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.790> with<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
recreated in 1.6 but with the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
recreated in 1.6 but with the
introduction<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.020> new<00:00:43.320> comments<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
introduction of two new comments the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
introduction of two new comments the
test<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.640> block<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> salmon<00:00:45.750> comment<00:00:46.079> we

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
test for block and the salmon comment we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
test for block and the salmon comment we
can<00:00:46.770> make<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> without<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.550> custom<00:00:47.879> spawners

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
can make it without the custom spawners

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.850 
can make it without the custom spawners
so<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> will<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.410> easier<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> create<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.090> use

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
so it will be easier to create and use

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
so it will be easier to create and use
what<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:54.239> reject<00:00:54.449> certain

hostile<00:02:16.250> mob<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.600> when<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.930> kill<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.410> zombie

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
hostile mob so when you kill a zombie

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.030 
hostile mob so when you kill a zombie
for<00:02:19.070> example<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:20.270> will<00:02:20.510> give<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.900> not<00:02:21.380> very

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
for example it will give you not very

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.360 
for example it will give you not very
useful<00:02:22.220> experience<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.150> more<00:02:23.510> trouble<00:02:24.370> in

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
useful experience but more trouble in

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.330 
useful experience but more trouble in
the<00:02:25.910> view<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.600> beasts<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:27.830> when<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.130> kill

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the view of the beasts so when you kill

the view of the beasts so when you kill
a<00:02:28.640> monster<00:02:29.510> for<00:02:30.020> example<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.709> have<00:02:30.920> one

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
a monster for example and you have one

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.430 
a monster for example and you have one
heart<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.880> will<00:02:32.150> spawn<00:02:32.390> experience<00:02:32.930> orbs<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
heart it will spawn experience orbs and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.160 
heart it will spawn experience orbs and
if<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.100> pick<00:02:34.640> up<00:02:34.820> this<00:02:35.180> experience<00:02:35.630> orbs

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
if you pick up this experience orbs

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.730 
if you pick up this experience orbs
they<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:36.890> still<00:02:37.160> kill<00:02:37.430> you

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.920 

I<00:02:40.630> used<00:02:41.630> also<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.940> resource<00:02:43.940> packs<00:02:44.240> to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
I used also the resource packs to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.340 
I used also the resource packs to
recreate<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.620> sounds<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.630> hear<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:48.230> I

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
recreate the sounds you can hear that I

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.790 
recreate the sounds you can hear that I
replaced<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.160> glass<00:02:49.310> breaking<00:02:49.670> sound<00:02:50.800> and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
replaced the glass breaking sound and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.550 
replaced the glass breaking sound and
also<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:53.920> sound<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.900> orb<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.140> leveling

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.850 
also the sound of the orb and leveling
up<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.550> will<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.090> they<00:02:59.450> all<00:02:59.739> sound<00:03:00.739> like

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
up so it will that they all sound like

the beasts to make everything work I use

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.830 
the beasts to make everything work I use
these<00:03:06.920> clocks<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:08.150> will<00:03:09.850> execute<00:03:10.850> two<00:03:11.330> tasks

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
these clocks that will execute two tasks

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.970 
these clocks that will execute two tasks
the<00:03:12.500> first<00:03:12.709> task<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.280> check<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:15.110> block

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the first task is to check if the block

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.460 
the first task is to check if the block
the<00:03:16.400> Beehive<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.030> in<00:03:17.360> place<00:03:17.570> if<00:03:18.260> it's

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the Beehive is in place if it's

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.030 
the Beehive is in place if it's
successfully<00:03:19.040> found<00:03:19.250> at<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:20.320> coordinates<00:03:21.320> it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
successfully found at the coordinates it

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.160 
successfully found at the coordinates it
will<00:03:22.250> give<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.090> signal<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.720> block<00:03:23.989> that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
will give the signal to this block that

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.610 
will give the signal to this block that
will<00:03:24.440> stop<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.489> clocks<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.480> these<00:03:27.260> blocks

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
will stop the clocks so these blocks

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.009 
will stop the clocks so these blocks
that<00:03:27.980> spawn<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> bunch<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:29.000> experience<00:03:29.600> potions

when the block is broke it won't give
the<00:03:36.140> signal<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.890> will<00:03:37.100> start<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.790> clock

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
the signal and it will start the clock

that are spawning the potions you can

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.250 
that are spawning the potions you can
see<00:03:42.080> how<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:42.500> work<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.540> they<00:03:44.540> will<00:03:44.690> spawn

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
see how they work and they will spawn

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.259 
see how they work and they will spawn
the<00:03:45.290> potions<00:03:45.799> until<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.250> torch<00:03:46.489> will<00:03:47.000> burn

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
the potions until the torch will burn

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.250 
the potions until the torch will burn
out<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.780> second<00:03:51.110> task<00:03:51.260> is<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.650> give<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
out the second task is to give the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.280 
out the second task is to give the
effect<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:55.390> resistance<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.780> players<00:03:57.050> that

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
effect of resistance to the players that

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.160 
effect of resistance to the players that
have<00:03:57.530> at<00:03:57.680> least<00:03:57.709> one<00:03:58.190> level<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.850> also<00:03:59.750> give

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
have at least one level and also give

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.350 
have at least one level and also give
them<00:04:00.410> effect<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.430> instant<00:04:01.819> damage

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
them effect of instant damage

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.130 
them effect of instant damage
I<00:04:02.980> give<00:04:03.980> them<00:04:04.209> resistance<00:04:05.209> because<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.750> want<00:04:05.990> to

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
I give them resistance because I want to

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.780 
I give them resistance because I want to
make<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.620> instant<00:04:07.010> damage<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.370> bit<00:04:07.550> more

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
make the instant damage a bit more

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.449 
make the instant damage a bit more
smooth<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:08.630> they<00:04:09.470> want<00:04:09.740> to<00:04:09.830> receive<00:04:10.069> the

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
smooth so they want to receive the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.630 
smooth so they want to receive the
default<00:04:10.970> three<00:04:11.780> hearts<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.650> damage<00:04:12.800> but

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
default three hearts of damage but

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.340 
default three hearts of damage but
instead<00:04:13.970> they<00:04:14.240> will<00:04:14.360> take<00:04:14.600> only<00:04:14.810> one<00:04:15.080> heart

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
instead they will take only one heart

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.849 
instead they will take only one heart
for<00:04:15.410> each<00:04:15.800> level<00:04:16.070> they<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:18.500> common

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
for each level they have and this common

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.279 
for each level they have and this common
block<00:04:19.010> will<00:04:19.250> take<00:04:19.820> one<00:04:20.209> level<00:04:20.419> from<00:04:21.169> the

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
block will take one level from the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.620 
block will take one level from the
player<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.789> player<00:04:22.970> won't<00:04:23.180> take<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
player so the player won't take the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.909 
player so the player won't take the
damage<00:04:23.810> infinitely<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.979> will<00:04:25.669> stop<00:04:26.919> being

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
damage infinitely and will stop being

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.670 
damage infinitely and will stop being

the experience potions because the sound
comment<00:04:39.680> is<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:40.070> bit<00:04:40.310> buggy<00:04:40.550> when<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.030> spawn

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
comment is a bit buggy when you spawn

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.050 
comment is a bit buggy when you spawn
the<00:04:41.810> items<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.860> can<00:04:43.010> see<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.370> if<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.700> spawn

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
the items you can see that if I spawn

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.350 
the items you can see that if I spawn
projectiles<00:04:44.630> like<00:04:45.140> arrow<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:46.400> flies<00:04:46.789> in<00:04:47.330> the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
projectiles like arrow it flies in the

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.850 
projectiles like arrow it flies in the
perfect<00:04:47.870> trajectory<00:04:49.090> but<00:04:50.090> when<00:04:50.599> I<00:04:50.630> use<00:04:51.560> the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
perfect trajectory but when I use the

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
perfect trajectory but when I use the
same<00:04:52.039> comment<00:04:52.520> for<00:04:52.789> the<00:04:53.060> items<00:04:54.820> they<00:04:55.820> are

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
same comment for the items they are

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.200 
same comment for the items they are
invisible<00:04:56.390> for<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.990> first<00:04:57.229> part<00:04:58.090> when<00:04:59.090> they

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
invisible for the first part when they

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.120 
invisible for the first part when they
spawn<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.780> there<00:05:00.320> are<00:05:00.590> started<00:05:01.010> being

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
spawn and there are started being

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.330 
spawn and there are started being
visible<00:05:01.610> only<00:05:01.849> when<00:05:02.300> they<00:05:02.539> fall<00:05:02.780> but<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.830> think

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
visible only when they fall but I think

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.159 
visible only when they fall but I think
that's<00:05:04.700> about<00:05:04.880> kind<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.330> will<00:05:05.510> definitely<00:05:05.720> be

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
that's about kind it will definitely be

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.080 
that's about kind it will definitely be
fixed<00:05:06.500> because<00:05:07.160> it's<00:05:07.550> just

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
fixed because it's just

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.290 
fixed because it's just
and<00:05:08.180> snapshot<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.660> this<00:05:08.870> version<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:10.160> when<00:05:11.060> you

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
and snapshot of this version so when you

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.260 
and snapshot of this version so when you
will<00:05:12.110> be<00:05:12.260> able<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.620> use<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.639> sound<00:05:13.910> come

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
will be able to use the sound come

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.080 
will be able to use the sound come
comment<00:05:14.840> for<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.199> bees<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:16.460> will<00:05:16.699> be<00:05:16.850> more

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
comment for the bees it will be more

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.730 
comment for the bees it will be more
useful<00:05:17.270> because<00:05:17.600> you<00:05:17.810> can<00:05:17.960> control<00:05:18.440> with<00:05:18.620> it

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
useful because you can control with it

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.040 
useful because you can control with it
there<00:05:19.310> are<00:05:19.340> levels<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:20.150> your<00:05:20.600> bees<00:05:20.810> will

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
there are levels that your bees will

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.409 
there are levels that your bees will
give<00:05:21.669> so<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:23.240> more<00:05:24.520> experience<00:05:25.520> value<00:05:25.729> that

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
give so the more experience value that

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.520 
give so the more experience value that
we<00:05:26.690> have<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.590> more<00:05:27.740> damage<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:28.100> will<00:05:28.370> take<00:05:28.580> I

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
we have the more damage you will take I
