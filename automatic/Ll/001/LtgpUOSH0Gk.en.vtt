00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello dear audience heartily 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 welcome to the flashlight now is yes 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.379
 known the cold season 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.269
 and then the hair becomes special 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.179
 claimed when they are often gefÃ¶nt 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 or through the dry heating air 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.540
 That's why I'm at the hairdresser's today 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.100
 Hackers and there are tips how to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.100
 can care for longer hair 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.970
 So I see that a period of four 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.940
 to five weeks where you drive the approach 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.820
 The problem is when the approach too 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.700
 far out the blond hair of the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.550
 creative just gets to hard and the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.530
 plan process then be made massive 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.060
 must and no longer be a clear result 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.460
 gets because the keratin vom hanser 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.739
 cured that is easy in 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.310
 color unlikely heavy does world 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.350
 to become 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.850
 So that's actually every color 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.280
 that's really just the one that's made 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.810
 approach and the rest 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.810
 to save hard quality 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.509
 It is the dream of every woman 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 just have beautiful hair to fight 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.880
 to have 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.369
 we have now we use here now 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.259
 at the lisa airshampoo that of course 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 specially for dyed hair is who 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.039
 his hair should also be colored 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 we use shampoo for dyed hair 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.599
 use this here once in addition 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 still construction offers the important thing is that 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.319
 We easily in this washing process 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.609
 hair back a little give to care 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.840
 order are always well kept from having 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.329
 after the shampoo comes always the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.679
 container first a kind of flushing 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.659
 but a lot better 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:02.250
 For example, he brings the gloss into the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 Long hair is also important 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.479
 Haarkur the week should again into 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.799
 damp hair can be massaged and 20 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.799
 minutes act 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.270
 also the cutting of the long hair is 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.250
 of course unlikely that important 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.590
 he is similar topic as with the color 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.850
 what should that be? 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.650
 let it be natural 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.900
 really important if you have one 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.360
 wants to grow hair or if you want 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.250
 She wants to keep that long 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 he really only asks for influences 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.300
 that cuts off what has grown after 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.160
 or what stop in the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.160
 become pointed out liquid 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.540
 and as a small treat 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 Friar sabrina he left one more 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.140
 beautiful bridal hairstyle with langhan 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.140
 can be done very well 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 The Lisa looks great with this 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.220
 hairstyle is it a bit one 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.160
 other bridal hairstyles without curls and 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.940
 but rather something classic 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.280
 but still looks very much 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.780
 Modern looks great from the whole is 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.550
 that fits together great 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.540
 I guess that's what you can do with it 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.540
 can make long hair
