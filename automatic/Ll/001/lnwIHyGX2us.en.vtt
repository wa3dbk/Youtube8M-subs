00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.529
 impossible to know how much they are this 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.149
 we call the rebellious risk the 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.010
 military court and prefers to stay 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.810
 discreet but these young Algerians 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.120
 graduates who refuses to do their 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.160
 national service are many this man 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.960
 received his first convocation at the end 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.270
 of his studies he refuses to introduce himself 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.910
 personally I was against 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.310
 to pass the medical service for me 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.369
 it was two years wasted two years 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.550
 to ruin my life we make two months of 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.390
 physical and military training and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.789
 after two months 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.300
 we will work for a salary but 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.200
 minimal me who studied 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.809
 techniques 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.820
 I'm sure I was in a 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.910
 store doing the listing of 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.260
 products so that teaches me nothing but 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.030
 after three convocations it is 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.590
 officially sought he no longer has the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.090
 choice he goes to the office of 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.460
 recruiting from his city of Kabylie and 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.770
 arranges to be assigned to alger the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.250
 most of summon at the level of the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.989
 capital city 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.280
 they come so you have more chances 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.559
 to be released 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.590
 I spent days in the barracks 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.590
 towards the end as it was a barracks of 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.420
 mechanical and its training rails ma 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.700
 university training has nothing to do 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.679
 the field of which he had not 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.479
 really need me today the 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.279
 national service is limited to 18 months 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.630
 despite everything he is lived by these young people 

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.349
 as a brake in their career 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.479
 professional 

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:24.859
 the military card is mandatory for 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.689
 work in the public sector 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.039
 but most rebels want to 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.139
 to make a career in the private sector 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.520
 so to escape the barracks the 

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.139
 most of them ride fake 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.139
 records like those young people north of the 

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:38.929
 country I had to do to a folder folder 

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.189
 medical as coach was asthmatic and 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.609
 everything but finally it did not work 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.529
 as well 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.240
 must I finally resigned myself to 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:45.799
 to make a support of had to try to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.659
 sing as a family as a coach alone 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.509
 to work at home it had to be good 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.310
 more or less change some realities 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.810
 in matter wants that both parents 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.579
 work and I filed my file 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.840
 it's been more than two years the site 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.489
 supports family I still had that one 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.380
 answer it's true we have rights 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.059
 and obligations but this obligation 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.829
 I think I could not be there full 

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:05.209
 I do not see myself dropping all 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.619
 world works and everything related to 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.759
 professional view bearing for two 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.720
 years because it would really be 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.340
 disastrous for my career 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 if the Algerian army promised a few 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.969
 facilities of the national service not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.050
 question for the moment to make it 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.060
 optional 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 the rebellious they hope the army 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.910
 forget them leila b riff alger rfi
