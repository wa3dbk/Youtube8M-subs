00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.850
 what a black wave and then we are not in 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:10.490
 a gameplay of eggs wiking bros is 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.409
 a simple game so simple that they are going to 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.699
 shit with laughter but it's very entertaining 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.190
 and then it becomes stressful because the 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.110
 Click monkey monkey can not win not 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.330
 we can beat the monkey 4 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.420
 I do not know why I can not beat him and since 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.160
 good trauma is a game that orita 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.810
 I will explain how it goes first has a 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.820
 versus which you can play against a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.490
 partner from your device 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.800
 healthy from another is not online not from 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.359
 the same phone plays both and 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.010
 now they will see how they are playing 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.829
 let's go back 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.550
 let's play what would be career that 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.379
 it is this 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.870
 I'm against chango 4 but let's give it 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.809
 the monkey one because the monkey 4 does not 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.499
 as such to see how this goes 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.600
 what you have to do is keep 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:54.160
 customize ready and winnow the other 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 enemy you have to give him over 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:03.480
 and I took it 3rd and 36 as you can see two of 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.630
 three falls two are not and two of three 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.159
 because practically winning two good 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.159
 Win two falls and you win 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.410

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.670

 trust in others even though this one 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.730
 I admit after a while you are a 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.460
 It's a little bit easier to be there, though 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.180
 I think it's lucky because I'm one 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.860
 plus one more 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:47.590

 policeman is very, very entertaining 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.080
 the music becomes very fun 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.630

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.130

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.389

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.949

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.490
 fast but good but one has I think 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.720
 that its difficulty or not to be faster 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.610
 not to be stronger one is going to have more 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.080
 life one of being more you know why then 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.300

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.389

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:35.039
