let's cover

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.900 
let's cover
kind<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.890> bad<00:02:44.100> but<00:02:46.520> oh<00:02:47.600> well<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.220> pets<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.730> was

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
kind of bad but oh well the pets one was

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.070 
kind of bad but oh well the pets one was
worth<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.540> also<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.320> think<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
worth it and also I think you have a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.620 
worth it and also I think you have a
speed<00:02:55.080> boost<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:56.000> then<00:02:57.000> everything<00:02:57.210> causes

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
speed boost and then everything causes

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.520 
speed boost and then everything causes
less<00:02:58.080> to<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.710> pretty<00:03:02.100> much<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:03.530> you

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
less to and it's pretty much what you

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.180 
less to and it's pretty much what you
