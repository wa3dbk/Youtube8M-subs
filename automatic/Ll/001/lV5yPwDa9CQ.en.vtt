00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hello everyone today for you guys I

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.470 
hello everyone today for you guys I
thought<00:00:01.829> I'd<00:00:02.010> make<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.159> video<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.760> how<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.240> bring

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
thought I'd make a video on how to bring

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.320 
thought I'd make a video on how to bring
fallout<00:00:03.810> 3<00:00:04.080> into<00:00:04.560> 2015<00:00:05.210> obviously<00:00:06.210> we<00:00:06.299> just

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
fallout 3 into 2015 obviously we just

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.730 
fallout 3 into 2015 obviously we just
entered<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.779> new<00:00:06.899> year<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.259> know<00:00:07.319> some<00:00:07.710> of

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
entered a new year and I know some of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.020 
entered a new year and I know some of
you<00:00:07.830> guys<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.130> still<00:00:08.220> planning<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.700> as<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.000> am

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
you guys are still planning it as I am

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.640 
you guys are still planning it as I am
of<00:00:09.300> course<00:00:09.540> so<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.050> thought<00:00:10.230> I'd<00:00:10.349> make<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> video

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
of course so I thought I'd make a video

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.650 
of course so I thought I'd make a video
on<00:00:10.860> how<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> modernize<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.610> game<00:00:11.790> as<00:00:12.000> much<00:00:12.509> as

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
on how to modernize the game as much as

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660 
on how to modernize the game as much as
possible<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> thought<00:00:13.920> context<00:00:14.460> would<00:00:14.549> go

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
possible so I thought context would go

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.220 
possible so I thought context would go
pretty<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.059> with<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.269> video<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.780> what

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
pretty well with this video and what

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.930 
pretty well with this video and what
you're<00:00:16.320> looking<00:00:16.529> at<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:16.800> now<00:00:16.830> our<00:00:17.279> vanilla

then coming back to Fallout 3 I felt
kind<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:24.950> weird<00:02:25.010> aiming<00:02:25.909> down<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> sights<00:02:26.360> and

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
kind of weird aiming down the sights and

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.420 
kind of weird aiming down the sights and
not<00:02:27.140> really<00:02:27.379> getting<00:02:27.530> an<00:02:27.680> iron<00:02:27.890> sight<00:02:28.129> it<00:02:28.250> just

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
not really getting an iron sight it just

it felt weird so this mod fixes it

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.600

perfectly<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.950> actually<00:02:31.220> even<00:02:31.430> works

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
perfectly and it actually even works

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.190 
perfectly and it actually even works
with<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> lot<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:31.940> weapon<00:02:32.209> mods<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.080> some

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
with a lot of weapon mods and for some

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.390 
with a lot of weapon mods and for some
reason<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.560> made<00:02:33.680> down<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.920> sights<00:02:34.099> kind<00:02:34.340> of

reason it made down the sights kind of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.009 
reason it made down the sights kind of
seems<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> modern<00:02:35.090> feature<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> game<00:02:35.780> I

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
seems like a modern feature to a game I

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.600 
seems like a modern feature to a game I
honestly<00:02:36.590> could<00:02:36.769> think<00:02:36.950> of<00:02:37.040> very<00:02:37.220> few<00:02:37.280> games

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
in the game I think you'd be really

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.330 
in the game I think you'd be really
surprised<00:04:05.870> how<00:04:05.989> much<00:04:06.260> these<00:04:06.709> small<00:04:06.980> changes

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
surprised how much these small changes

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.250 
surprised how much these small changes
can<00:04:07.400> make<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.669> difference<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.120> game<00:04:08.329> I<00:04:08.540> mean

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
can make a difference in the game I mean

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.509 
can make a difference in the game I mean
if<00:04:09.590> you're<00:04:09.709> like<00:04:09.859> me<00:04:10.010> you've<00:04:10.160> gone<00:04:10.250> into<00:04:10.489> a

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
if you're like me you've gone into a

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.339 
if you're like me you've gone into a
game<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:10.879> you've<00:04:10.970> looked<00:04:11.120> at<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.359> an<00:04:11.810> alcohol

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
game and you've looked at a an alcohol

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.470 
game and you've looked at a an alcohol
bottle<00:04:12.680> or<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.859> plate<00:04:13.129> or<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.430> utensil<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.419> you

bottle or a plate or a utensil and you
look<00:04:14.599> at<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.810> really<00:04:15.079> closely<00:04:15.379> and<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.739> just

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
look at it really closely and it just

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.460 
look at it really closely and it just
the<00:04:16.010> textures<00:04:16.340> are<00:04:16.459> awful<00:04:16.760> up<00:04:16.880> close<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.470> you

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
the textures are awful up close and you

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.080 
the textures are awful up close and you
know<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.620> like<00:04:19.039> when<00:04:19.220> mod<00:04:19.370> makers<00:04:19.669> go<00:04:19.820> in<00:04:19.970> and

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
know I like when mod makers go in and

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.920 
know I like when mod makers go in and
fix<00:04:20.269> something<00:04:20.570> small<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.109> kind<00:04:21.320> of

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
fix something small and you kind of

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.200 
fix something small and you kind of
together<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.440> get<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.710> cumulative

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
together and you get this cumulative

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.270 
together and you get this cumulative
effect<00:04:24.210> over<00:04:24.960> all<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.620> small<00:04:25.830> items<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.220> the

effect over all the small items in the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.860 
effect over all the small items in the
game<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:26.789> really<00:04:27.030> adds<00:04:27.180> up<00:04:27.389> for<00:04:27.720> example

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
game and it really adds up for example

many mods that do things like this I

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.020

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
and find them and add them all together

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.120 
and find them and add them all together
and<00:05:01.259> you're<00:05:01.380> going<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.530> get<00:05:01.680> an<00:05:01.740> effect<00:05:02.070> that

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
and you're going to get an effect that

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.110 
and you're going to get an effect that
is<00:05:02.250> just<00:05:02.550> crazy

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
is just crazy

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.810 
is just crazy
it'll<00:05:03.780> make<00:05:03.870> fallout<00:05:04.139> 3<00:05:04.410> even<00:05:05.039> better<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.430> of

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
it'll make fallout 3 even better and of

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.339 
it'll make fallout 3 even better and of
course<00:05:06.030> there's<00:05:06.210> NMC<00:05:06.570> texture<00:05:06.930> pack<00:05:07.139> which

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
course there's NMC texture pack which

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.020 
course there's NMC texture pack which
acts<00:05:07.560> as<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> great<00:05:07.949> base<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.400> game<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:08.849> by

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
acts as a great base to the game and by

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.240 
acts as a great base to the game and by
that<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.240> mean<00:05:09.380> it's<00:05:10.380> great<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.680> install<00:05:10.979> first

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
that I mean it's great to install first

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.800 
that I mean it's great to install first
and<00:05:11.550> then<00:05:11.639> kind<00:05:11.820> of<00:05:11.849> overwrite<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.360> lot<00:05:12.599> of<00:05:12.690> its

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
and then kind of overwrite a lot of its

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.779 
and then kind of overwrite a lot of its
files<00:05:13.050> with<00:05:13.349> some<00:05:13.530> of<00:05:13.650> these<00:05:13.710> smaller<00:05:14.430> better
