Curved smartphones, curved screens and fingerprint scanners. Smartphone makers are trying to apply new features to their top tier smartphones. Some are successful and some aren't.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:38.700
You are watching the Unboxholics show and this is the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.900
Before taking a closer look at the phone, let's see what's inside the retail box.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.800
The Galaxy Note Edge arrived in a quite premium package. Aside from the usual manuals and accessories, there is a leather case that can be folded.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:01.200
Although the Note Edge is a high end device, Samsung decided to include average and common earphones.

00:01:01.415 --> 00:01:10.500
As soon as I removed the protective cover, the "Edge Screen" attracted my attention immediately.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:33.090
Regarding the overall build quality, Samsung tried really hard to deliver a high quality device that is pleasing to the eyes and hands of the user. 

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:48.400
Aside from the main speaker, the back side also features a fingerprint scanner which I still do not find useful in smartphones. 

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:55.500
The S-Pen is a common characteristic of the Note smartphone series and it could not be missing from the Galaxy Note Edge. 

00:01:55.553 --> 00:02:00.000
Let's take a look at the dimensions of the Note Edge...

00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:10.000
Display: 5.6 inches - Height: 151.3mm - Width: 82.4 Thickness: 8.3mm Weight: 174g

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:22.500
The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge screen made me feel uncomfortable a lot, especially when I was making hasty moves.

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:28.050
I could not get used to it at all even until the last day of shipping it back to Samsung. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.200
Let's take a look at the technical spefications of the Note Edge.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 - CPU: Quad-Core 2.7 GHz Krait 450 GPU: Adreno 320

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:59.200
RAM: 3GB Storage: 32/64GB (microSD, up to 128GB)

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:07.600
Resolution: 2560 x 1600 PPI: 524

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.000
Battery: 3000 mAh Networks supported: 3G/4G

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:28.700
The However, I felt like it didn't last as much as I wanted, since it could not last for more than a day.

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:47.100
Undoubtedly, the highlight of the smartphone is its famous "Edge' Screen. Most people think it is an extension of the screen but that's false. It is an autonomous screen that helps the user with his/her daily tasks. 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:04:01.300
The Edge screen has display a lot of information, like notifications from Facebook, which can be customized by the user.

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:09.080
Moreover, a lot of applications like the camera app take advantage of the Edge screen which leaves more space to the main screen.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.200
Last but not least, Samsung added the ability to have a personalized design and information stream.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:34.200
As much as I'd love to be impressed by the Edge screen, I believe it is a gimmick rather than something useful. I also found myself touching it accidentally a lot of times. 

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:54.000
If someone can disregard the Edge screen, the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge is an impressive phone. The smartphones comes with Android 4.4.4 pre-installed and brings with it the improved Samsung Android "skin".

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:58.400
Regarding the Samsung Android skin, I feel like everything has been re-organized neatly and that more control has been given to the user. 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:10.000
The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge is an extremely fast phone and it will certainly disappoint you. The multi-tasking capabilities made my experience with the Note Edge a lot better.

00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:24.700
The display of the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge is probably the best one in the high-end smartphone market right now. From its extremely vibrant colors and brightness to the excellent black color levels, the screen of the Note Edge will render you speechless.

00:05:24.887 --> 00:05:59.400
The 3.7 front camera can capture 440p video at 30fps while the 16MP rear camera can capture 4K video at 30fps and 1080p video at 60fps. The rear camera's performance at low light situations was amazing. 

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:03.000
Check out our samples. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:22.300
The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge is available now for â‚¬820. In my opinion, this is an extremely overpriced phone. I would recommend taking a look at the Note 4, unless you believe that the Edge screen will be of great use for you.

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:28.100
