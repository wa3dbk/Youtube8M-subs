00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.960
 as a partner of the uma 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.690
 and as a university coach in these 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.440
 thank moments administration 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.350
 temporary because I honestly believe that 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.980
 if the management they have done in this 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.430
 year and a half two years almost two years that 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.430
 they are in the club 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 no no it would not have been possible for 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.730
 university is champion last year 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.230
 and not possible decision that university 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.239
 come out of this bad moment 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.220
 who has lived until recently not in 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.390
 as to results and I say it clearly 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.940
 because why 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.710
 I've had different stages in the uam 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.149
 and as a footballer later as 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.570
 trainer and working conditions 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.640
 they were inadequate now the thing has 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.440
 totally changed is another club 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 university and that's why I 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.610
 thanks to the administration 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.989
 temporary because it provides all the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.280
 facilities to be able to make a good 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.140
 work in the next row I say that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.020
 this team is very talented in all 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.520
 your lines have players who have a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 great sense of belonging by 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.210
 university students are the great 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.009
 mostly out of the house and those who do not 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.979
 are out in the house are fans of 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.510
 club as the case of rainer towers by 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 say it clearly 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.740
 and then all are all from 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.100
 university because i a werner schüler 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.440
 ya néstor duarte that one is from cantolao 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 I think werner and werner from where it does not come 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.970
 of races I think it was not but good 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 but they formed regattas I think they came very 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.360
 young people at 2 to 1 ours arrived 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.690
 as I was 17 years old and berna when I had 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.510
 18 if I'm not wrong then this this 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.860
 is a team made up of soccer players 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.200
 of the house that have a sense of 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 very large membership by the shirt and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.580
 today they have shown that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.110
 feeling is delivered on the court to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.030
 that adds the audacity that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.320
 have to play soccer with play is 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.820
 very talented half of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.040
 court for in front of best with much 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.590
 talent with a great future and I the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.490
 I congratulate everyone very much because 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.630
 because I do not remember long ago 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.670
 time of a match like that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.170
 university has won many 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.820
 matches last year has come out champion 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 but a party that has lost against the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.020
 san martín because san martín is a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.700
 great team has great players 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.750
 and he has a great coach like 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.150
 furious of uribe who was my coach 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.189
 as well 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 and the great merit to have won him a 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.519
 important team like the university 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.519
 san martín you will the attitude 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.629
 Claw as you call it 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.360
 definitely appears in these 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.040
 moments but it 's a team that shows 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.329
 football in all its lines and that's why at 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.069
 final is able to turn a 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.540
 result so not with the team already caught 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.920
 trust Miguel and that is very important 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.730
 the team of a team that was very 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.470
 beaten 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.640
 it's the players themselves what happens 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.260
 that has chained three victories 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.879
 followed and that gives you a lot of moral and much 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.829
 confidence to continue believing what is 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.860
 is doing the trainings 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.960
 definitely not 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.620
 and I think that such a result 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.050
 emotionally serves you serves you for the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.040
 millo of the opening that is the tournament 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.420
 opening and closing that is in tournament more 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.220
 important that comes in this year that 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.650
 bet on this project of 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.090
 incorporate club people is very clear 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.470
 here from the beginning of the idea was 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.120
 that I assumed as director of football 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.220
 of the club because that's how it was 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.000
 agreed unfortunately from the start 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.760
 of angel comizzo who resigned 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.860
 I had to assume this this moment and 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.800
 good and you have to give it forward and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.570
 take this out as working training and 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.570
 with much dedication nothing more
