00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
criticisms of our cost devices is

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.569 
criticisms of our cost devices is
they're<00:01:37.810> hard<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.170> use<00:01:38.380> this<00:01:38.859> one<00:01:39.100> does<00:01:39.310> seem

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
they're hard to use this one does seem

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.880 
they're hard to use this one does seem
better<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.869> we'll<00:01:41.109> have<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.439> test<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.740> out

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
better but we'll have to test it out

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.130 
better but we'll have to test it out
fully<00:01:42.189> to<00:01:42.429> see<00:01:42.609> whether<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.270> Wi-Fi<00:01:43.719> is<00:01:43.960> any

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
fully to see whether the Wi-Fi is any

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.959 
fully to see whether the Wi-Fi is any
easier<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.799> use<00:01:45.929> it's<00:01:46.929> also<00:01:47.109> crucially<00:01:48.100> got<00:01:48.460> an

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
easier to use it's also crucially got an

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.029 
easier to use it's also crucially got an
electronic<00:01:49.450> program<00:01:49.960> guide<00:01:49.990> built<00:01:50.499> in<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:50.979> you

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
electronic program guide built in so you

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.249 
electronic program guide built in so you
can<00:01:51.280> hook<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.579> up<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.939> DVR<00:01:52.359> station<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:53.079> to

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
can hook it up to the DVR station and to

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.130 
can hook it up to the DVR station and to
your<00:01:53.409> Sky<00:01:54.009> box<00:01:54.310> or<00:01:54.609> your<00:01:54.700> digi<00:01:55.030> box<00:01:55.329> and<00:01:55.659> record
