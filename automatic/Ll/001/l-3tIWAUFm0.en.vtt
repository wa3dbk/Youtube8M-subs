butcher the study or I don't recommend

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.000 
butcher the study or I don't recommend
you<00:02:52.790> do<00:02:52.940> but<00:02:53.420> if<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.629> want<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.560> does<00:02:54.769> use<00:02:54.980> a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
you do but if you want to it does use a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.520 
you do but if you want to it does use a
normal<00:02:55.489> tokyo<00:02:55.790> marui<00:02:55.940> slide<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.780> Barrel<00:02:57.200> and

so<00:03:00.379> if<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.829> don't<00:03:00.950> mind<00:03:01.099> giving<00:03:01.430> up<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.640> star

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
so if you don't mind giving up the star

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.460 
so if you don't mind giving up the star
symbol<00:03:02.269> just<00:03:02.420> on<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.750> slide<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.379> of

symbol just on the slide and kind of

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.470 
symbol just on the slide and kind of
place<00:03:03.620> two<00:03:03.769> metal<00:03:04.099> parts<00:03:04.370> for<00:03:04.730> longevity<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
place two metal parts for longevity and

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.330 
place two metal parts for longevity and
probably<00:03:06.349> fudge<00:03:06.500> around<00:03:06.799> with<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:06.980> inside<00:03:07.220> if

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
probably fudge around with the inside if

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.470 
probably fudge around with the inside if
you<00:03:07.370> want<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.579> increase<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:08.000> power<00:03:08.120> as<00:03:08.299> well

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
you want to increase the power as well

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.349 
you want to increase the power as well
so<00:03:08.870> that's<00:03:09.109> not<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.470> faint<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.769> heart

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
so that's not for the faint of heart
