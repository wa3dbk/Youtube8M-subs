distribution of villages and provinces

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
distribution of villages and provinces
so<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.530> water<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.220> can't<00:01:44.579> be

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so we have water here that can't be

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
so we have water here that can't be
played<00:01:44.939> over<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.049> villages<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.740> we

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
played over we have villages and then we

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
played over we have villages and then we
have<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> provinces<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.610> different<00:01:47.970> areas

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
have the provinces in different areas

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.910 
have the provinces in different areas
but<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> gives<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> two<00:01:49.500> different<00:01:49.770> options

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
but that gives you two different options

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
but that gives you two different options
if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> play<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.390> water<00:01:51.630> or

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
if you want to play with water or

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.060 
if you want to play with water or
without<00:01:52.170> water<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> play

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
without water and if you want to play

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.170 
without water and if you want to play
with<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> starting<00:01:53.579> provinces<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.090> the

with the starting provinces in the
center<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.780> now

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
center or not now

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
center or not now
in<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.670> game<00:01:56.850> each<00:01:57.060> player<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
in this game each player is going to be

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
in this game each player is going to be
playing<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:58.229> tiles<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.040> see

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
playing with these tiles that you see

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.530 
playing with these tiles that you see
over<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.490> there's<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> whole<00:02:00.030> pile<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> them

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
over here there's a whole pile of them

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.179 
over here there's a whole pile of them
and<00:02:00.840> these<00:02:01.200> tiles<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.649> different<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and these tiles are different on the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.319 
and these tiles are different on the
other<00:02:02.340> side<00:02:02.520> you'll<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.090> side

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
other side you'll see on this side

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.910 
other side you'll see on this side
they're<00:02:03.600> clearly<00:02:04.049> hidden<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.530> can't<00:02:04.799> see

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
they're clearly hidden so you can't see

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
they're clearly hidden so you can't see
what<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.100> other<00:02:05.250> side<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.630> main

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
what the other side is but on the main

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
what the other side is but on the main
side<00:02:07.079> you'll<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.590> different<00:02:08.099> arrangements

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
side you'll have different arrangements

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.339 
side you'll have different arrangements
of<00:02:08.849> blue<00:02:09.060> yellow<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.450> red<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
of blue yellow and red so we have a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.220 
of blue yellow and red so we have a
yellow<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> red<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.569> two<00:02:12.900> blues

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
yellow and a red and I have two blues

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.700 
yellow and a red and I have two blues
and<00:02:13.440> our<00:02:13.500> other

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
and our other

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.780 
and our other
player<00:02:13.860> over<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.220> will<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.430> something

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
player over here will have something

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.030 
player over here will have something
different<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.930> my<00:02:16.290> turn<00:02:16.530> essentially<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
different but on my turn essentially I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800 
different but on my turn essentially I
am<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.580> choose<00:02:17.820> one<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.540> these<00:02:18.750> three

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
am going to choose one of these three

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.140 
am going to choose one of these three
tiles<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.620> play<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.010> board<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:21.060> are

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
tiles to play to the board and there are

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.490 
tiles to play to the board and there are
several<00:02:21.390> rules<00:02:21.720> governing<00:02:22.050> how<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.260> play

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
several rules governing how you play

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.840 
several rules governing how you play
them<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> most<00:02:23.130> part<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.700> pretty

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
them but for the most part it's pretty

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.760 
them but for the most part it's pretty
straightforward<00:02:24.180> when<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.200> place<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> tile

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
straightforward when you place a tile

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.590 
straightforward when you place a tile
you<00:02:25.800> must<00:02:26.250> place<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.090> borders<00:02:27.330> at

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you must place it so that it borders at

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.140 
you must place it so that it borders at
least<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.530> their<00:02:28.680> province<00:02:29.250> portion<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.970> I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
least one of their province portion so I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.000 
least one of their province portion so I
can<00:02:30.600> place<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.650> borders<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
can place this like this it borders the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.070 
can place this like this it borders the
yellow<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:33.090> place<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
yellow I can place this like this it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.690 
yellow I can place this like this it
borders<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.410> red<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.920> could<00:02:35.070> place<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.550> so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
borders the red I could place it here so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.160 
borders the red I could place it here so
the<00:02:35.820> de<00:02:35.880> borders<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> red<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.050> yellow

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the de borders the red and the yellow

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.590 
the de borders the red and the yellow
but<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:38.190> I'm<00:02:38.760> smart<00:02:39.030> I'm<00:02:39.240> probably<00:02:39.420> gonna

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
but if I'm smart I'm probably gonna

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.720 
but if I'm smart I'm probably gonna
place<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.840> over<00:02:39.990> here<00:02:40.110> by<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.350> blue<00:02:40.730> like

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
place it over here by this blue like

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
place it over here by this blue like
this<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.450> what<00:02:42.630> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.350> is

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this and so what this is going to do is

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.710 
this and so what this is going to do is
it's<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.520> create<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.880> province<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.450> three

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
it's going to create a province of three

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.200 
it's going to create a province of three
in<00:02:45.840> size<00:02:46.110> if<00:02:46.830> there's<00:02:47.220> ever<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.550> province<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.120> at

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
in size if there's ever a province of at

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.330 
in size if there's ever a province of at
least<00:02:48.330> two<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.780> size<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.530> create<00:02:49.920> you're

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
least two in size that you create you're

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.950 
least two in size that you create you're
going<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.670> claim<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.630> going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> go

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
going to claim it so I'm going to go

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.760 
going to claim it so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.200> I'm<00:02:52.260> gonna<00:02:52.350> put<00:02:52.530> one<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.680> my

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
ahead and I'm gonna put one of my

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.710 
ahead and I'm gonna put one of my
pagodas<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.550> province<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.300> show<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.630> it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
pagodas on this province to show that it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.990 
pagodas on this province to show that it
belongs<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.140> me<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.400> basically<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.880> end

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
belongs to me this is basically the end

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.340 
belongs to me this is basically the end
of<00:02:57.240> my<00:02:57.390> turn<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:57.870> gonna<00:02:58.050> go<00:02:58.170> ahead<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
of my turn and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.810 
of my turn and I'm gonna go ahead and
take<00:02:58.530> another<00:02:58.800> tile<00:02:59.070> add<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.610> my<00:02:59.700> own

take another tile add it to my own

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.520 
take another tile add it to my own
supply<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.570> pass<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.080> turn<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.440> other

supply and pass the turn to the other
player<00:03:01.800> who<00:03:02.040> would<00:03:02.160> then<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> same

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
player who would then do the same

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.610 
player who would then do the same
they're<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> place<00:03:04.050> one<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.470> their

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
they're going to place one of their

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.080 
they're going to place one of their
tiles<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.070> they<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.370> double<00:03:05.580> blue<00:03:05.850> and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
tiles so they have a double blue and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.540 
tiles so they have a double blue and
they<00:03:06.570> have<00:03:06.690> two<00:03:06.900> blue<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.350> Red's<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.310> what

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
they have two blue and Red's so what

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.830 
they have two blue and Red's so what
they<00:03:08.670> could<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.270> this<00:03:09.450> wouldn't<00:03:09.720> be<00:03:09.810> a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
they could do and this wouldn't be a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.360 
they could do and this wouldn't be a
very<00:03:09.960> smart<00:03:10.260> play<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.710> they<00:03:10.830> could<00:03:10.980> place<00:03:11.160> this

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
very smart play is they could place this

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.250 
very smart play is they could place this
here<00:03:11.700> what<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.690> going<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.930> do<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.140> it's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
here what this is going to do is it's

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.930 
here what this is going to do is it's
going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.500> expand<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.100> area<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.580> already

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
going to expand the area that I already

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.790 
going to expand the area that I already
control<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.570> can't<00:03:15.810> seize<00:03:16.140> control<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.710> it

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
control they can't seize control of it

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320 
control they can't seize control of it
like<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.730> they<00:03:17.850> would<00:03:17.970> simply<00:03:18.210> be

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
like this so they would simply be

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.060 
like this so they would simply be
expanding<00:03:18.750> my<00:03:18.870> province<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.500> three<00:03:19.740> to<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
expanding my province of three to a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.370 
expanding my province of three to a
province<00:03:20.460> of<00:03:20.580> four<00:03:20.820> not<00:03:21.600> really<00:03:21.870> very<00:03:22.110> good

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
province of four not really very good

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.100 
province of four not really very good
they<00:03:22.950> could<00:03:23.010> instead<00:03:23.970> place<00:03:24.300> this<00:03:24.570> over<00:03:24.840> here

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
they could instead place this over here

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.720 
they could instead place this over here
and<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.440> would<00:03:25.620> make<00:03:25.740> them<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.160> province<00:03:26.610> of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
and this would make them a province of

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.430 
and this would make them a province of
red<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.210> they<00:03:27.270> would<00:03:27.420> place<00:03:27.630> their<00:03:27.930> control

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
red and they would place their control

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.830 
red and they would place their control
over<00:03:28.470> here<00:03:29.180> alternatively<00:03:30.180> they<00:03:30.480> could<00:03:30.540> play

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
over here alternatively they could play

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.150 
over here alternatively they could play
this<00:03:31.020> double<00:03:31.350> blue<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.710> and<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:31.980> would

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
this double blue one and this would

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.590 
this double blue one and this would
placed<00:03:32.550> out<00:03:32.730> here<00:03:32.910> would<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.090> give<00:03:33.330> them<00:03:33.510> a

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
placed out here would just give them a

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.720 
placed out here would just give them a
blue<00:03:33.750> province<00:03:34.140> starting<00:03:34.470> off<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.610> their

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
blue province starting off and their

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.070 
blue province starting off and their
other<00:03:35.820> play<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.210> exactly<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> same<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:36.990> the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
other play is exactly the same as the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.990 
other play is exactly the same as the
first<00:03:37.230> one<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.590> showed<00:03:37.740> you<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.160> they're

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
first one that I showed you so they're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.940 
first one that I showed you so they're
placing<00:03:39.330> out<00:03:39.450> here<00:03:39.690> they<00:03:40.200> create<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.710> two

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
placing out here they create this two

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.100 
placing out here they create this two
province<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.460> red<00:03:41.640> they<00:03:42.210> draw<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> new<00:03:42.660> tile<00:03:42.870> and

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
province of red they draw a new tile and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.710 
province of red they draw a new tile and
they<00:03:43.170> pass<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.590> play<00:03:43.770> back<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.190> me<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:45.030> there

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
they pass the play back to me now there

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.910 
they pass the play back to me now there

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
can create provinces like this one I've

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.900 
can create provinces like this one I've
shown<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.380> here<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.100> can<00:03:53.220> also<00:03:53.250> claim

villages so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:03:56.370> at<00:03:56.520> what<00:03:56.700> one<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.390> other<00:03:57.420> scenarios

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
look at what one of the other scenarios

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.320 
look at what one of the other scenarios
could<00:03:58.170> be<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:59.430> first<00:03:59.610> player<00:03:59.850> back<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
could be as the first player back to

green I have one of these double blues
again<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.390> can<00:04:03.570> place<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:04.050> out<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.560> this

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
again and I can place this out like this

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.250 
again and I can place this out like this
two<00:04:05.730> things<00:04:06.060> happen<00:04:06.450> because<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.140> have

a five size province and a five sighs
province<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:10.860> actually<00:04:11.160> called<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.610> major

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
province is actually called a major

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.030 
province is actually called a major
province<00:04:12.780> when<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.380> province<00:04:13.710> of<00:04:13.800> five

province when you get a province of five
in<00:04:14.220> size<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:15.000> put<00:04:15.270> two<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.870> your<00:04:16.859> pagodas<00:04:17.310> down

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
in size you put two of your pagodas down

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.890 
in size you put two of your pagodas down
there<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:17.850> already<00:04:18.120> have<00:04:18.390> one<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.720> add<00:04:18.870> a

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
there so you already have one you add a

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.090 
there so you already have one you add a
second<00:04:19.260> one<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.380> show<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:19.770> some<00:04:19.920> major

second one to show that some major
province<00:04:20.580> this<00:04:21.210> allows<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.780> be<00:04:22.020> prevented

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
province this allows it to be prevented

province this allows it to be prevented
from<00:04:22.800> taking<00:04:23.190> being<00:04:23.460> taken<00:04:23.669> over<00:04:23.730> from

creates<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.449> major<00:06:01.630> province<00:06:02.229> which<00:06:02.380> this

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
creates a major province which this

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.659 
creates a major province which this
player<00:06:02.770> is<00:06:02.860> going<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.070> put<00:06:03.159> on<00:06:03.250> a<00:06:03.280> second

player is going to put on a second
pagoda<00:06:03.970> which<00:06:04.389> gets<00:06:04.630> them<00:06:04.810> one<00:06:04.990> more<00:06:05.139> out<00:06:05.289> onto

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
pagoda which gets them one more out onto

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.350 
pagoda which gets them one more out onto
the<00:06:05.620> board<00:06:05.860> now<00:06:06.729> I<00:06:06.760> didn't<00:06:07.090> say<00:06:07.210> this

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
the board now I didn't say this

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.330 
the board now I didn't say this
previously<00:06:07.720> but<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.020> goal<00:06:08.229> is<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.800> race<00:06:09.310> to

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
previously but the goal is a race to

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.040 
previously but the goal is a race to
have<00:06:09.669> all<00:06:09.909> of<00:06:10.120> your<00:06:10.210> pagodas<00:06:10.630> out<00:06:10.750> onto<00:06:10.960> the

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
have all of your pagodas out onto the

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.050 
have all of your pagodas out onto the
board<00:06:11.260> so<00:06:11.740> replacing<00:06:12.400> somebody<00:06:12.669> else<00:06:12.849> is<00:06:13.030> in

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
board so replacing somebody else is in

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.550 
board so replacing somebody else is in
doubling<00:06:13.510> one<00:06:13.630> of<00:06:13.720> yours<00:06:13.930> it's<00:06:14.139> a<00:06:14.199> great

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
doubling one of yours it's a great

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.290 
doubling one of yours it's a great
scenario<00:06:14.979> in<00:06:15.340> addition<00:06:15.940> this<00:06:16.030> is<00:06:16.090> now

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
scenario in addition this is now

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.760 
scenario in addition this is now
protected<00:06:16.900> from<00:06:17.050> being<00:06:17.110> captured<00:06:17.620> by<00:06:17.650> the

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
protected from being captured by the

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.469 
protected from being captured by the
other<00:06:17.979> player<00:06:18.250> so<00:06:18.669> these<00:06:18.760> two<00:06:19.030> pagodas<00:06:19.389> are

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
other player so these two pagodas are

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.120 
other player so these two pagodas are
out<00:06:19.599> there<00:06:19.750> permanently<00:06:19.960> and<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.949> kind<00:06:21.099> of

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
out there permanently and it kind of

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.740 
out there permanently and it kind of
positions<00:06:21.580> them<00:06:21.729> to<00:06:21.849> take<00:06:22.030> over<00:06:22.210> this<00:06:22.389> village

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
positions them to take over this village

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.110 
positions them to take over this village
if<00:06:23.139> they<00:06:23.440> get<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:23.710> that<00:06:23.830> position<00:06:24.070> later<00:06:24.370> so

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
if they get to that position later so

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.790 
if they get to that position later so
you're<00:06:25.449> going<00:06:25.659> to<00:06:25.690> be<00:06:25.840> playing<00:06:26.080> trying<00:06:26.560> to

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
you're going to be playing trying to

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.409 
you're going to be playing trying to
prevent<00:06:27.159> your<00:06:27.400> opponent<00:06:27.639> from<00:06:27.970> getting<00:06:28.270> major

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
prevent your opponent from getting major

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:29.939

voiding game I wouldn't say it's a great
game<00:06:48.100> but<00:06:48.340> I<00:06:48.400> also<00:06:48.610> would<00:06:49.000> not<00:06:49.150> say<00:06:49.449> it's

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
game but I also would not say it's

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.270 
game but I also would not say it's
terrible<00:06:50.110> matter<00:06:50.500> of<00:06:50.560> fact<00:06:50.710> I'd<00:06:50.919> say<00:06:51.130> it's

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
terrible matter of fact I'd say it's

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.879 
terrible matter of fact I'd say it's
good<00:06:51.729> it's<00:06:52.449> a<00:06:52.509> pretty<00:06:52.660> standard<00:06:53.110> game<00:06:53.680> in

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889

which you're trying to get rid of all
your<00:06:55.300> pieces<00:06:55.539> and<00:06:55.780> it's<00:06:55.900> a<00:06:55.990> race<00:06:56.169> to<00:06:56.410> the<00:06:56.470> end

your pieces and it's a race to the end
there<00:06:57.370> are<00:06:57.400> a<00:06:57.520> lot<00:06:57.729> of<00:06:57.759> games<00:06:58.060> that<00:06:58.240> do<00:06:58.479> things

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
there are a lot of games that do things

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.939 
there are a lot of games that do things
like<00:06:58.840> this<00:06:59.050> you're<00:06:59.199> going<00:06:59.289> to<00:06:59.410> try<00:06:59.919> and

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
like this you're going to try and

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.070 
like this you're going to try and
outmaneuver<00:07:00.580> your<00:07:01.030> opponent<00:07:01.509> protect<00:07:01.870> your

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
outmaneuver your opponent protect your

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.570 
outmaneuver your opponent protect your
own<00:07:02.110> pieces<00:07:02.590> and<00:07:02.740> hopefully<00:07:02.860> capture<00:07:03.370> some<00:07:03.550> of

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
own pieces and hopefully capture some of

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.150 
own pieces and hopefully capture some of
theirs<00:07:03.910> I<00:07:04.419> can't<00:07:05.289> say<00:07:05.470> it'll<00:07:05.650> come<00:07:05.800> off<00:07:05.919> of<00:07:06.039> my

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
theirs I can't say it'll come off of my

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.379 
theirs I can't say it'll come off of my
shelf<00:07:06.400> very<00:07:06.610> frequently<00:07:06.940> or<00:07:07.090> that<00:07:07.210> it<00:07:07.300> might

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:07.389 
shelf very frequently or that it might

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:08.999 
shelf very frequently or that it might
even<00:07:07.600> stay<00:07:07.810> in<00:07:07.930> my<00:07:08.050> collection<00:07:08.500> and<00:07:08.650> that's

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
even stay in my collection and that's

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.050 
even stay in my collection and that's
simply<00:07:09.190> because<00:07:09.490> there<00:07:09.669> are<00:07:09.699> other<00:07:09.850> games

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
simply because there are other games

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.029 
simply because there are other games
that<00:07:10.210> I<00:07:10.330> think<00:07:10.570> do<00:07:10.750> this<00:07:10.930> better<00:07:11.169> piece

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
that I think do this better piece

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.200 
that I think do this better piece
fighting<00:07:12.400> games<00:07:12.580> for<00:07:12.789> example<00:07:12.880> there<00:07:13.150> are

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
fighting games for example there are

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.340 
fighting games for example there are
some<00:07:13.389> in<00:07:13.510> the<00:07:13.570> gift<00:07:13.780> series<00:07:14.139> where<00:07:14.260> you're

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
some in the gift series where you're

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
some in the gift series where you're
trying<00:07:14.440> to<00:07:14.530> get<00:07:14.620> all<00:07:14.740> of<00:07:14.830> your<00:07:14.949> pieces<00:07:15.070> onto

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
trying to get all of your pieces onto

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.460 
trying to get all of your pieces onto
the<00:07:15.520> board<00:07:15.760> those<00:07:16.570> are<00:07:16.780> better<00:07:16.930> or<00:07:17.169> there<00:07:17.350> are

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
the board those are better or there are

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
the board those are better or there are
certain<00:07:17.620> ones<00:07:17.889> where<00:07:18.010> you're<00:07:18.070> just<00:07:18.190> trying<00:07:18.430> to

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
certain ones where you're just trying to

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.040 
certain ones where you're just trying to
play<00:07:18.729> longer<00:07:19.060> than<00:07:19.270> your<00:07:19.389> opponent<00:07:19.780> they're

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
play longer than your opponent they're

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.420 
play longer than your opponent they're
also<00:07:20.289> in<00:07:20.470> the<00:07:20.560> Gib<00:07:20.680> series<00:07:20.979> that<00:07:21.130> are<00:07:21.220> good

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
also in the Gib series that are good

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.600 
also in the Gib series that are good
even<00:07:22.090> games<00:07:22.650> like<00:07:23.650> hive<00:07:23.919> where<00:07:24.250> you're<00:07:24.370> trying

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
even games like hive where you're trying

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.950 
even games like hive where you're trying
to<00:07:24.760> surround<00:07:25.090> an<00:07:25.240> opponent's<00:07:25.600> piece<00:07:25.630> I<00:07:25.900> think

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
to surround an opponent's piece I think

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.779 
to surround an opponent's piece I think
have<00:07:26.440> a<00:07:26.500> similar<00:07:26.979> feel<00:07:27.250> to<00:07:27.280> something<00:07:27.699> like

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:27.789 
have a similar feel to something like

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:28.950 
have a similar feel to something like
this<00:07:27.940> where<00:07:28.150> you're<00:07:28.270> trying<00:07:28.449> to<00:07:28.630> outmaneuver

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
this where you're trying to outmaneuver

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.830 
this where you're trying to outmaneuver
your<00:07:29.229> opponent<00:07:29.710> but<00:07:30.190> still<00:07:30.520> play<00:07:31.510> a<00:07:31.539> little

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 
your opponent but still play a little

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.330 
your opponent but still play a little
bit<00:07:32.020> better<00:07:32.500> than<00:07:32.800> this<00:07:32.860> or<00:07:33.039> a<00:07:33.099> little<00:07:33.160> bit

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:33.340 
bit better than this or a little bit

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.920 
bit better than this or a little bit
more<00:07:33.370> advanced<00:07:33.970> than<00:07:34.060> this<00:07:34.330> one<00:07:34.510> if<00:07:34.720> you're

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
more advanced than this one if you're

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.540 
more advanced than this one if you're
looking<00:07:35.169> to<00:07:35.289> get<00:07:35.440> into<00:07:35.680> this<00:07:35.889> genre<00:07:35.949> I<00:07:36.310> think

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550 
looking to get into this genre I think

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.370 
looking to get into this genre I think
chin<00:07:36.760> is<00:07:36.880> going<00:07:37.030> to<00:07:37.120> be<00:07:37.210> a<00:07:37.240> great<00:07:37.570> way<00:07:37.750> to<00:07:37.780> start

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380 
chin is going to be a great way to start

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.200 
chin is going to be a great way to start
somebody<00:07:38.949> off<00:07:39.220> with<00:07:39.370> these<00:07:39.490> games<00:07:39.729> it's<00:07:40.090> going
