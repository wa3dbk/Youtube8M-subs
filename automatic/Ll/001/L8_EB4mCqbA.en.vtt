00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
what I do end up going over this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.150 
what I do end up going over this
again<00:04:23.400> later<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:25.230> then<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.470> applied<00:04:25.740> shroom

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
as my inner corner highlight but I

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.100 
as my inner corner highlight but I
mainly<00:04:29.220> focused<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.910> on<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.270> lower<00:04:30.480> lash<00:04:30.600> line

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
mainly focused it on the lower lash line

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.830 
mainly focused it on the lower lash line
as<00:04:31.290> opposed<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.740> what<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.550> would<00:04:32.730> usually<00:04:32.880> do<00:04:33.270> up

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
as opposed to what I would usually do up

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.350 
as opposed to what I would usually do up
along<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> sides<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.340> eye<00:04:35.700> look<00:04:36.120> on<00:04:36.270> the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
along the sides of the eye look on the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.610 
along the sides of the eye look on the
inner<00:04:36.480> corner<00:04:36.810> just<00:04:36.840> because<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.320> don't<00:04:37.380> want

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
inner corner just because I don't want

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.200 
inner corner just because I don't want
to<00:04:37.710> lose<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.160> amber<00:04:38.460> lights<00:04:38.640> color<00:04:38.940> on<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
to lose the amber lights color on the

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.240 
to lose the amber lights color on the
inner<00:04:39.360> corner<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:40.110> then<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.740> apply<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:40.980> other

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
inner corner and then I apply the other

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.360 
inner corner and then I apply the other
side<00:04:41.550> of<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:42.170> mascara<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.590> bottom

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
for some people but whatever I also

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.400 
for some people but whatever I also
powdered<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.330> on<00:05:00.450> top<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.840> lip<00:05:01.050> pencil

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
just to kind of take down the brown a

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.660 
just to kind of take down the brown a
little<00:05:02.910> bit<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.600> then<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.410> decided<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.400> it

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
little bit and then I decided that it

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.370 
little bit and then I decided that it
wasn't<00:05:05.820> dark<00:05:06.090> enough<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.480> I<00:05:06.570> applied<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:06.900> gel

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
wasn't dark enough so I applied that gel

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.670 
wasn't dark enough so I applied that gel
liner<00:05:07.590> on<00:05:07.860> my<00:05:07.890> waterline<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.820> then<00:05:09.570> I<00:05:09.680> smudged

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
liner on my waterline and then I smudged

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.610 
liner on my waterline and then I smudged
it<00:05:10.980> a<00:05:11.130> lot<00:05:11.550> with<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.420> deep<00:05:12.600> damson<00:05:12.870> color<00:05:13.290> and

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
it a lot with the deep damson color and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.130 
it a lot with the deep damson color and
I<00:05:14.250> really<00:05:14.880> smoked<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.420> as<00:05:15.540> you<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:15.900> see<00:05:16.110> I

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
I really smoked it as you can see I

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.590 
I really smoked it as you can see I
ended<00:05:16.620> up<00:05:16.710> going<00:05:17.010> almost<00:05:17.700> all<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.300> way<00:05:18.360> to<00:05:18.420> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
ended up going almost all the way to the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.060 
ended up going almost all the way to the
inner<00:05:18.720> corner<00:05:18.810> with<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.320> deep<00:05:19.470> damson<00:05:19.680> color

inner corner with the deep damson color

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.250 
inner corner with the deep damson color
