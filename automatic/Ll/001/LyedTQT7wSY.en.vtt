00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.920
Hey, I'm Dr. Josh Axe and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.860
Today I'm going to be making dessert, which
I know everyone's excited about, and we're

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.550
making chocolate mousse.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.330
By the end of this recipe you're going to
ask yourself, "How could dessert taste so

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.240
amazing and be so healthy at the same time?"

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.170
So we're going to start making some chocolate
mousse.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.140
For starters, what we're going to do is we
took dates and we soaked them in water.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.460
You want to soak dates for about one to two
hours.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.030
We're going to go ahead and drop those in
a blender.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.640
You can make this recipe in a blender or in
a food processor.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.140
So we've got about a cup of dates here.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.090
We're going to go and drop them into the blender
for starters.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.090
Dates are good.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.300
The one negative side of dates is they have
a lot of sugar, but overall they also have

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.752
a lot of fiber, they have a lot of antioxidants
and a lot of different nutrients that are

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:08.890
actually going to help absorb the sugar, and
it's got fiber, which is good.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.700
The next thing we're going to be adding in
are some avocados.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.260
We've got about one avocado here, one to two
avocados.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.549
This recipe calls for two to three.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.340
What we're going to do next is we're going
to take an avocado and slice it up.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.740
So we're going to start off here and we're
going to cut it long ways.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.229
Avocados are great because they're loaded
with healthy fat, actually Omega 9 fats which

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.149
are also known as monounsaturated fats.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.070
To get this avocado open we simply twist like
this in order to get the seed out in the middle.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.859
You can simply take a knife . . . I missed,
okay . . . and then simply pull it out like

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.409
this.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.520
What you can do from here is either you can
peel off the skin or you can take a spoon

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
and actually scoop it out.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.189
We're going to go ahead and just scoop it
out here.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.829
When you're feeling for avocados, you want
to make sure they're soft.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.470
Not too soft, but pretty soft is better for
scooping it.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.330
It just means they're riper, which is actually
going to be better.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.230
So I've got a spoon here, just spoon out the
rest of the avocado.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.230
This is going to be great.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.330
We're loading up our diet with good healthy
fat here, like so.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.740
So now that we've got the avocado, we're going
to just simply dump that in next.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.420
Again, you're going to use typically two avocados
if they're two medium-sized or larger avocados.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.600
The next thing we're going to add in is maple
syrup.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.410
Now, we get 100% Grade B maple syrup.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.980
You want to get Grade B, not Grade A. Grade
B means it's the least processed, so it hasn't

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.720
been processed at all and still has many of
the antioxidants and other things that actually

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.720
make it good.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.959
So we're going to take the maple syrup and
add in about half a cup.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:01.550
Simply pour that in like so, half a cup of
Grade B maple syrup.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.209
The next thing we're going to add in is a
little bit or organic vanilla extract.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.049
We're going to put about a teaspoon of this
in.

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.910
Simply pour it like so.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.540
The last thing, actually a couple more things,
but we're going to add in cocoa now, cacao

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.540
powder.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.290
Cocoa is loaded with antioxidants.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.220
Actually, if you look on an ORAC score chart,
which is oxygen radical absorbance capacity

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.269
which is how many antioxidants are in something.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.730
Cocoa scores actually in the top ten.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.520
It's one of the foods highest in antioxidants.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.599
We're going to add in about three-fourths
a cup here of pure cocoa powder, get as much

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.469
as we can.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:54.530
We may need to scoop a little bit more out.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.159
There we go, about three-fourths of a cup.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.610
I'm never exact on anything.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.849
You've probably noticed that by now.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.439
The next thing we're going to add in is about
half a cup of water.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.209
We're going to simply pour that into the mix,
and it is ready to blend.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.099
What we're going to do is go ahead and pop
it up here and we're going to go ahead and

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:20.109
get this blending.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.740
Now that we're finished blending, the chocolate
mousse is ready to serve.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.240
You're simply going to take it out of the
blender or food processor you have it in and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.500
just simply start scooping it out.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.720
You'll see here, it comes out just as a beautiful
texture.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.610
We're just going to continue to bring it out
like this, and you can put it in a bowl.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.940
I'll tell you one of my favorite things to
do with this recipe is once you have it as

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.760
a mousse, take some of it and freeze it and
make it into fudgsicles.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.840
That's something actually your kids will love.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.420
It's great as a snack rather than doing a
lot of the conventional stuff you'll find

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.500
in many of the stores out there.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.900
Again, this is totally toxin-free.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.900
It's healthy.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.170
Again, you always do need to be careful that
. . . again, I don't think you should go and

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.560
just make this in one sitting and throw the
whole thing down, but again, it's good to

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.310
do as a healthy dessert here and there because
it's loaded with a lot of good vitamins, minerals

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.890
and nutrients.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.950
We've got most of it out here, and again,
you'll see here from this picture, just a

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.650
nice, creamy texture there that we've got
in the chocolate mousse.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.730
So we'll go ahead and try it.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.180
Oh, you're going to love this.
