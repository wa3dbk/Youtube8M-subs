to say now many of you probably have

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
to say now many of you probably have
chests<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.090> this<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.100> if<00:00:38.100> you're

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
chests like this this and this if you're

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.569 
chests like this this and this if you're
organized<00:00:39.410> but<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.680> few<00:00:40.920> who<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> chest

like<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.630> is<00:00:42.840> highly<00:00:43.079> volatile<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
like this this is highly volatile so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.710 
like this this is highly volatile so
volatile<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.579> fact<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.940> does<00:00:45.120> not<00:00:45.270> even<00:00:45.510> get<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
volatile in fact it does not even get a

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.740 
volatile in fact it does not even get a
sign<00:00:46.100> because<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.220> was<00:00:47.370> simply<00:00:47.700> burn<00:00:48.030> through

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sign because it was simply burn through

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.310

redstone<00:02:12.450> ore<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:13.740> if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> craft<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.310> all

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
redstone ore now if you craft it all

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.000 
redstone ore now if you craft it all
into<00:02:14.640> redstone<00:02:15.030> ore<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:16.709> place<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
into redstone ore and you place the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.510 
into redstone ore and you place the
redstone<00:02:17.370> ore<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.099> iron

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
redstone ore like so you can get iron

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.580 
redstone ore like so you can get iron
ore<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.390> now<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.690> your<00:02:21.840> harp<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.140> even<00:02:22.380> further

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
ore but now if your harp it even further

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.700 
ore but now if your harp it even further
and<00:02:23.010> place<00:02:23.700> aight<00:02:24.000> redstone<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.350> get<00:02:25.500> to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
and place aight redstone in you get to

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.510 
and place aight redstone in you get to
iron<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.310> it's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
iron so it's

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.700 
iron so it's
quick<00:02:26.700> way<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.880> doing<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.330> now<00:02:28.110> transform<00:02:28.590> all

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
quick way of doing it now transform all

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.330 
quick way of doing it now transform all
that<00:02:28.890> into<00:02:29.340> iron<00:02:29.610> ore<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.300> get<00:02:30.420> 16<00:02:30.810> iron

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
that into iron ore and you get 16 iron

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.030 
that into iron ore and you get 16 iron
now<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.640> place<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.000> like<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:34.830> get

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
now if you place this like so you get

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.730 
now if you place this like so you get
one<00:02:35.460> gold<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.150> again<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.530> this

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
one gold but again if you do this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.460 
one gold but again if you do this
instead<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.700> racing<00:02:38.820> floor<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.390> 1441<00:02:40.170> gold

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
instead of racing floor for 1441 gold

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.760 
instead of racing floor for 1441 gold
you<00:02:40.710> can<00:02:40.860> do<00:02:41.010> 842<00:02:41.690> exactly<00:02:42.690> equivalent<00:02:42.960> but

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
you can do 842 exactly equivalent but

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.850 
you can do 842 exactly equivalent but
much<00:02:44.040> faster<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.900> for<00:02:45.900> gold<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.650> may<00:02:46.800> think

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
much faster now for gold you may think

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.730 
much faster now for gold you may think
well<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.540> what's<00:02:48.750> eight<00:02:48.930> stacks<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.410> Kabul

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
well that's what's eight stacks of Kabul

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.620 
well that's what's eight stacks of Kabul
and<00:02:49.800> all<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:50.010> got<00:02:50.160> was<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.520> gold<00:02:50.820> what's<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
and all I got was for gold what's a

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.750 
and all I got was for gold what's a
useless<00:02:51.840> mod<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:52.860> would<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.280> been<00:02:53.520> you're

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
useless mod and I would have been you're

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.510 
useless mod and I would have been you're
so<00:02:53.790> damn<00:02:54.270> wrong<00:02:54.570> because<00:02:54.990> look<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.520> for

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
so damn wrong because look at this for

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.060 
so damn wrong because look at this for
gold<00:02:56.790> gives<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.150> one<00:02:57.390> diamond<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.140> one

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
gold gives you one diamond and one

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.430 
gold gives you one diamond and one
diamond<00:02:59.550> gives<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.000> four<00:03:00.210> gold<00:03:00.570> equivalence

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
diamond gives you four gold equivalence

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.250 
diamond gives you four gold equivalence
it's<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.430> mystery<00:03:02.940> how<00:03:03.060> they<00:03:03.480> get<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.780> done<00:03:04.020> no

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it's a mystery how they get it done no

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.920 
it's a mystery how they get it done no
it's<00:03:04.380> not<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:04.950> still<00:03:05.250> mine<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.750> have

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
it's not but still mine it and you have

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.980 
it's not but still mine it and you have
one<00:03:07.140> diamond<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:08.070> will<00:03:08.880> see<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.210> part<00:03:09.660> two

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
one diamond I will see you in part two

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
for loss of stone it's in this video but

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.050 
for loss of stone it's in this video but
I<00:03:13.650> wanted<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> make<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.640> different<00:03:14.790> part

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
I wanted to make it a different part

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.410 
I wanted to make it a different part
part<00:03:15.750> two<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.440> take<00:03:17.070> my<00:03:17.100> whole<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.940> build<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
part two I take my whole you build a

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.020 
part two I take my whole you build a
wall<00:03:21.440> that's<00:03:22.440> was<00:03:22.620> charging<00:03:23.130> now<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.000> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
second part now you may be wondering why

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.390 
second part now you may be wondering why
have<00:03:30.990> i<00:03:31.080> got<00:03:31.260> these<00:03:31.380> random<00:03:31.890> cobblestone

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
have i got these random cobblestone

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.940 
have i got these random cobblestone
walls<00:03:32.700> why<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.870> random<00:03:34.110> is

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
walls why not that random is

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.030
