floor<00:00:47.449> which<00:00:48.019> was<00:00:48.260> stranded<00:00:48.739> bamboo<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.549> I

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
floor which was stranded bamboo so I

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.939 
floor which was stranded bamboo so I
thought<00:00:49.909> well<00:00:50.209> I<00:00:50.449> think<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.170> can<00:00:51.229> do<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:51.769> I

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
thought well I think I can do this I

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.840 
thought well I think I can do this I
chose<00:00:52.819> a<00:00:53.209> stranded<00:00:53.869> carbonized<00:00:54.559> bamboo<00:00:55.010> from

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
chose a stranded carbonized bamboo from

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.569 
chose a stranded carbonized bamboo from
Lumber<00:00:56.359> Liquidators<00:00:56.389> I<00:00:57.199> chose<00:00:57.799> it<00:00:58.039> primarily

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
Lumber Liquidators I chose it primarily

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.059 
Lumber Liquidators I chose it primarily
because<00:00:59.299> I<00:00:59.779> thought<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:00.350> would<00:01:00.469> be<00:01:00.499> a<00:01:00.709> little

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
because I thought that would be a little

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.359 
because I thought that would be a little
easier<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.549> install<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.299> I<00:01:03.199> really<00:01:03.920> wanted

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
easier to install and I really wanted

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.179 
easier to install and I really wanted
something<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.449> was<00:01:05.689> hard<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.710> wouldn't

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
something that was hard and it wouldn't

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.069 
something that was hard and it wouldn't
scratch<00:01:07.460> with<00:01:07.789> all<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.119> animals<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:08.719> I<00:01:08.750> have

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
scratch with all the animals so I have

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.940 
scratch with all the animals so I have
the<00:01:09.590> old<00:01:09.799> carpet<00:01:10.340> was<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.329> bad<00:01:11.719> I<00:01:12.079> had<00:01:12.530> four

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the old carpet was so bad I had four

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.219 
the old carpet was so bad I had four
cats<00:01:13.280> at<00:01:13.609> the<00:01:13.729> time<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.329> they<00:01:14.600> had<00:01:14.810> shredded

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
cats at the time and they had shredded

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.340 
cats at the time and they had shredded
the<00:01:15.799> step<00:01:16.100> down<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.640> was<00:01:17.630> embarrassed<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.259> have

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
the step down I was embarrassed to have

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.889 
the step down I was embarrassed to have
people<00:01:18.859> come<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:19.219> visit<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:19.789> it's<00:01:20.659> just
