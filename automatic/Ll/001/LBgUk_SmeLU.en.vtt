taking that whole 318 out so I have a
bear<00:00:38.370> engine<00:00:38.850> bay<00:00:39.030> now<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.129> start

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
bear engine bay now so I can start

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.450 
bear engine bay now so I can start
pulling<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> stuff<00:00:45.239> off<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.840> and

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
Mike who lent me this great engine lift

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.490 
Mike who lent me this great engine lift
I<00:01:04.200> was<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> big<00:01:05.340> help

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
I was a big help

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.310 
I was a big help
so<00:01:07.500> 318<00:01:08.280> came<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.820> no<00:01:09.330> problems<00:01:09.870> at<00:01:10.050> all<00:01:15.320> we

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so 318 came out no problems at all we

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.220 
so 318 came out no problems at all we
took<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> out<00:01:16.770> through<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.160> top<00:01:18.140> instead<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
took it out through the top instead of

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.720 
took it out through the top instead of
dropping<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.710> through<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> bottom<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
dropping it through the bottom the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.310 
dropping it through the bottom the
k-frame<00:01:20.940> that<00:01:21.720> probably<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.140> been<00:01:22.260> a

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
k-frame that probably would have been a

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920 
k-frame that probably would have been a
lot<00:01:22.530> easier<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.180> anyway<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.660> took<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
lot easier but anyway so we took the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
lot easier but anyway so we took the
whole<00:01:25.050> thing<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.470> engine<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> tranny<00:01:26.370> all<00:01:26.670> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
whole thing out engine and tranny all in

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.390 
whole thing out engine and tranny all in
one<00:01:27.420> unit

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
one unit

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
one unit
yeah<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.640> no<00:01:29.790> big<00:01:30.000> hiccup<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.810> it
