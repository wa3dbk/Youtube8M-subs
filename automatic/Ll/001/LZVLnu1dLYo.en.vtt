00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:10.729 

I<00:04:07.910> added<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.270> thin<00:04:09.540> yellow<00:04:09.780> glaze<00:04:10.200> over<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
I added a thin yellow glaze over the

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.190 
I added a thin yellow glaze over the
white<00:04:10.980> spots<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.610> red<00:04:11.760> apple<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.390> turn<00:04:13.050> off

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
white spots on the red apple I turn off

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.960 
white spots on the red apple I turn off
the<00:04:13.350> light<00:04:13.560> here<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.130> can<00:04:14.310> see<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.880> it

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the light here so you can see that it

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.390 
the light here so you can see that it
did<00:04:15.180> actually<00:04:15.480> make<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> difference<00:04:16.139> but<00:04:16.799> even

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
did actually make a difference but even

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.340 
did actually make a difference but even
with<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.000> lights<00:04:18.180> off<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.690> still<00:04:18.900> really

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
with the lights off it's still really

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.860 
with the lights off it's still really
hard<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.799> tell<00:04:20.040> in<00:04:20.310> person<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.030> promise<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.720> can

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
hard to tell in person I promise you can

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.650 
hard to tell in person I promise you can
tell<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.139> difference<00:04:22.970> now<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.150> time<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.540> add

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
tell the difference now it's time to add

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.360 
tell the difference now it's time to add
a<00:04:24.900> yellow<00:04:25.050> glaze<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.710> other<00:04:25.919> parts<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
a yellow glaze to the other parts of the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:38.160 
a yellow glaze to the other parts of the
painting

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.020 

if<00:04:39.170> you<00:04:39.470> added<00:04:39.980> enough<00:04:40.280> value<00:04:40.790> in<00:04:40.940> your

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
if you added enough value in your

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.780 
if you added enough value in your
background<00:04:41.630> which<00:04:42.260> means<00:04:42.500> you<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.890> dark

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
background which means you have dark

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.630 
background which means you have dark
spots<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.660> light<00:04:44.900> spots<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:46.220> can<00:04:46.400> go<00:04:46.520> ahead

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
spots and light spots you can go ahead

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.370 
spots and light spots you can go ahead
and<00:04:46.790> glaze<00:04:47.150> instead<00:04:47.660> of<00:04:47.780> painting<00:04:48.200> which<00:04:48.350> is

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
and glaze instead of painting which is

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.530 
and glaze instead of painting which is
what<00:04:48.650> I'm<00:04:48.740> about<00:04:48.950> to<00:04:49.010> do<00:04:49.250> but<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.150> difference

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
what I'm about to do but the difference

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.780 
what I'm about to do but the difference
is<00:04:50.780> you're<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.680> add<00:04:51.890> more<00:04:52.160> liquid<00:04:52.670> than

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
is you're going to add more liquid than

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.820 
is you're going to add more liquid than
paint<00:04:53.120> while<00:04:53.450> I'm<00:04:53.750> pretty<00:04:54.170> much<00:04:54.350> going<00:04:54.650> to

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
paint while I'm pretty much going to

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.150
