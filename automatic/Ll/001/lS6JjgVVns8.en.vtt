00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.839
 one of the good things about having a cat is 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.069
 You do not need to teach where to do it. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 the necessities 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.590
 he already knows exactly where he then 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.330
 being so long choosing sand beyond 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.000
 of our preferences when it comes to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.939
 cleaning the box cats also have the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 them and leave satisfied pets owners 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.779
 It is not always simple. 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.660
 Luckily, there is a lot of choice in 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.269
 market and certainly one will please 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.880
 both human and house cats 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.690
 do not even take a look some people use 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 things like the corn cob newspaper 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 sand sawing and other improvisations 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.070
 only these things can contain 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.680
 and germs, increasing the risk of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 contamination by fungi and bacteria 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.600
 besides bruises and skin irritations 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.940
 so they are not recommended 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 the silica sands available in micro 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.829
 crystals that are softer for 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.590
 or in larger crystals have a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 incredible absorption capacity and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.479
 This lasted longer than it controls the smell 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.210
 strong as well as absorb pee 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.280
 you just need to take the stool in 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.920
 granulated sands have substances that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 they absorb the pee forming clumps when 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 contacted him to clean 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 you just need to take the stool and the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.150
 and complete the box with sand 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.040
 clean 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.140
 they can be made of sand or 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.710
 natural pebbles raw material 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 volcanic clay algae starch 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.259
 Cassava has many types but finally 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.869
 pay attention because only a few can 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.939
 be thrown straight into the toilet 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.460
 granulates are made of 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.780
 compressed grain pinus sawdust and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.110
 so it has the characteristic smell 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 this way in contact with pee they 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.180
 then swelled and crumbled at the time of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.729
 cleaning is just sifting to reuse 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.159
 whole grains and complete with new 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.560
 they are biodegradable and can be 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.570
 thrown in the toilet now that you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.360
 and your trigger already know the variety that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.729
 there is time to test and see 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.729
 Which one do you prefer? 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.340
 I know that neither you 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.740
 let alone your flat like them but 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.400
 What you two do not know is that these 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.030
 fleas that you see or feel are just the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.030
 Tip of the iceberg
