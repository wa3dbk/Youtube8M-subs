00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.869 

all<00:00:01.589> right<00:00:01.740> I'm<00:00:01.860> gonna<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.370> about<00:00:02.610> the

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
all right I'm gonna do a video about the

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.200 
all right I'm gonna do a video about the
under<00:00:03.120> hood<00:00:03.330> wiring<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.959> mega<00:00:04.140> squirt<00:00:04.500> here<00:00:04.740> I

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
under hood wiring a mega squirt here I

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.720 
under hood wiring a mega squirt here I
started<00:00:06.210> out<00:00:06.330> with<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:07.170> nice<00:00:07.589> big<00:00:07.950> 8<00:00:08.400> gauge

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
started out with a nice big 8 gauge

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.830 
started out with a nice big 8 gauge
power<00:00:09.090> cable<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.929> goes<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.440> relay<00:00:10.889> here

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
power cable it goes into this relay here

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.230 
power cable it goes into this relay here
and<00:00:12.950> this<00:00:13.950> relay<00:00:15.500> is<00:00:16.500> switched<00:00:16.529> by<00:00:17.240> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and this relay is switched by the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.099 
and this relay is switched by the
ignition<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.880> basically<00:00:20.880> comes<00:00:21.210> into<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> fuse

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
ignition and basically comes into a fuse

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
ignition and basically comes into a fuse
box<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.039> I've<00:00:23.490> got<00:00:23.519> all<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> fuses

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
box here so I've got all the fuses

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.179 
box here so I've got all the fuses
pulled<00:00:24.900> off<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> moment<00:00:25.769> except<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.099> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
pulled off at the moment except for this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.669 
pulled off at the moment except for this
one<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.470> demonstration<00:00:28.550> but<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:31.140> 12

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
one just as a demonstration but so 12

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
one just as a demonstration but so 12
volt<00:00:31.859> comes<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> top<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> puts<00:00:33.420> 12

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
volt comes in at the top and it puts 12

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.880 
volt comes in at the top and it puts 12
volt<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.710> besides<00:00:35.780> 6<00:00:36.780> separate<00:00:37.170> circuits<00:00:37.649> so

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
volt out besides 6 separate circuits so

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.760 
volt out besides 6 separate circuits so
I'm<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.239> running<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:40.469> I've<00:00:40.559> got

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
I'm going to be running see I've got

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.430 
I'm going to be running see I've got
fuel<00:00:41.100> hooked<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> top<00:00:43.140> right

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
fuel hooked up up here at the top right

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
fuel hooked up up here at the top right
so<00:00:44.100> I'll<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.309> running<00:00:44.460> him<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:45.809> probably

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so I'll be running him and then probably

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.209 
so I'll be running him and then probably
to<00:00:46.559> spark<00:00:46.920> fuses<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.640> believe<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.890> planning

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to spark fuses I believe I was planning

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.060 
to spark fuses I believe I was planning
on<00:00:50.309> doing<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.850> fuel<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.559> think<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.860> just

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
on doing to fuel but I think I'm just

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
on doing to fuel but I think I'm just
gonna<00:00:53.190> go<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:54.379> then<00:00:55.379> I've<00:00:55.469> got<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
gonna go with the one then I've got the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.889 
gonna go with the one then I've got the
mega<00:00:56.280> score<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.610> ECU<00:00:56.940> power<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
mega score at ECU power here at the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.860 
mega score at ECU power here at the
bottom<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.219> ran<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.699> auxilary<00:01:00.180> 8

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
bottom and then I ran an auxilary 8

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.939 
bottom and then I ran an auxilary 8
gauge<00:01:01.230> over<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:03.049> kind<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> area<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gauge over to kind of the area in the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.130 
gauge over to kind of the area in the
floor<00:01:05.280> board<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> use<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
floor board so I'm going to use that to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.039 
floor board so I'm going to use that to
hook<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> power<00:01:07.920> inverter<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> run<00:01:09.900> my

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
hook up a power inverter just to run my

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
hook up a power inverter just to run my
laptop<00:01:10.500> since<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.159> my<00:01:11.280> laptop<00:01:11.670> hooked

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
laptop since I know how my laptop hooked

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
laptop since I know how my laptop hooked
up<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.320> decent

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
up in there a lot so get some decent

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.460 
up in there a lot so get some decent
power<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:16.020> basically<00:01:16.140> what

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
power in there but basically what

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.039 
power in there but basically what
happens<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.040> red<00:01:17.549> wire<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:17.790> comes<00:01:18.720> into

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
happens this red wire here comes into

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
happens this red wire here comes into
the<00:01:19.170> relay<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.100> relay<00:01:20.400> coils<00:01:20.790> grounded<00:01:21.210> right

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
the relay the relay coils grounded right

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.109 
the relay the relay coils grounded right
behind<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> relay<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:23.119> it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
behind the relay here on this look it's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.140 
behind the relay here on this look it's
just<00:01:25.040> self<00:01:26.040> tappers<00:01:26.460> driven<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
just self tappers driven into the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.039 
just self tappers driven into the
firewall

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
firewall

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.370 
firewall
well<00:01:28.979> basically<00:01:29.600> mmm<00:01:30.600> excuse<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:31.020> when<00:01:31.200> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
well basically mmm excuse me when this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.640 
well basically mmm excuse me when this
red<00:01:32.189> wire<00:01:32.400> gets<00:01:32.670> power<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.720> gives<00:01:33.930> us<00:01:34.079> nice<00:01:34.259> big

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
red wire gets power it gives us nice big

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.780 
red wire gets power it gives us nice big
8<00:01:34.979> gauge<00:01:35.310> wire<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> way<00:01:36.119> around<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:37.700> lot<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
8 gauge wire all the way around a lot of

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
8 gauge wire all the way around a lot of
good<00:01:38.909> power<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> mega<00:01:39.780> score<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
good power to the mega score and to the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.670 
good power to the mega score and to the
injectors<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> spark<00:01:41.939> system<00:01:42.680> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
injectors and to the spark system and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.770 
injectors and to the spark system and
all<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.310> most<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> factory<00:01:45.390> stuff<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
all that so most of the factory stuff is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780 
all that so most of the factory stuff is
gonna<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> picture<00:01:46.700> because<00:01:47.700> I'm

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
gonna be out of the picture because I'm

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.050 
gonna be out of the picture because I'm
gonna<00:01:47.909> remove<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> later<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:50.670> red

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
gonna remove that later on so the red

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.200 
gonna remove that later on so the red
wire<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.689> switches<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.759> was<00:01:53.759> actually

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
wire that switches all that was actually

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.859 
wire that switches all that was actually
tied<00:01:54.450> into<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.110> ECU<00:01:55.439> here<00:01:56.450> off<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.719> ignition

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
tied into the ECU here off the ignition

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.230 
tied into the ECU here off the ignition
switch<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.979> verified<00:01:59.250> that<00:02:00.290> that<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
switch so I have verified that that is

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
switch so I have verified that that is
12<00:02:03.240> volt<00:02:03.420> hot<00:02:03.630> while<00:02:03.960> cranking<00:02:04.500> which<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> very

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
12 volt hot while cranking which is very

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.279 
12 volt hot while cranking which is very
important<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> ECU<00:02:06.780> can<00:02:07.190> sync<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
important so that the ECU can sync the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.440 
important so that the ECU can sync the
crank<00:02:10.289> trigger<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.039> start<00:02:11.670> spark<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.300> can

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
crank trigger and start spark so it can

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.040 
crank trigger and start spark so it can
actually<00:02:12.750> start

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
actually start

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.510 
actually start
car<00:02:13.730> something<00:02:14.730> else<00:02:14.850> I've<00:02:15.030> got<00:02:15.180> left<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.600> do

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
car something else I've got left to do

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.290 
car something else I've got left to do
these<00:02:17.520> female<00:02:17.940> relay<00:02:18.330> pods<00:02:18.960> here<00:02:19.880> go<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
these female relay pods here go to the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.140 
these female relay pods here go to the
auto<00:02:21.540> shut<00:02:21.930> down<00:02:22.110> relay<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.640> fuel<00:02:23.940> pump

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
auto shut down relay and the fuel pump

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.240 
auto shut down relay and the fuel pump
relay<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.570> I<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.080> rig<00:02:25.260> those<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.770> rig<00:02:26.070> them

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
relay so I have to rig those up rig them

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.330 
relay so I have to rig those up rig them
together<00:02:26.700> essentially<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.070> magnet

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
together essentially so that the magnet

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.510 
together essentially so that the magnet
squirt<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.760> power<00:02:29.970> them

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
squirt can power them

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.320 
squirt can power them
unfortunately<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.640> output<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> manga

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
unfortunately the output of the manga

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.440 
unfortunately the output of the manga
squirt<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.990> only<00:02:34.830> good<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.240> about<00:02:36.240> one<00:02:36.420> of

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
squirt is only good for about one of

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.320 
squirt is only good for about one of
those<00:02:36.860> automotive<00:02:37.860> relays<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:39.090> fuel<00:02:39.300> pump

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
those automotive relays on the fuel pump

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.820 
those automotive relays on the fuel pump
output<00:02:40.190> so<00:02:41.190> I've<00:02:41.550> got<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.380> daisy-chain<00:02:43.380> those

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
output so I've got to daisy-chain those

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.410 
output so I've got to daisy-chain those
relays<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.460> that<00:02:44.610> one<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.880> them<00:02:45.000> flips<00:02:45.270> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
relays so that one of them flips the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.850 
relays so that one of them flips the
other<00:02:45.570> one<00:02:45.810> stuff<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.500> there's<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.770> lot

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
other one stuff like that there's a lot

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.130 
other one stuff like that there's a lot
of<00:02:46.890> information<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.520> there<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.240> I'm

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
of information out there on that so I'm

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.870 
of information out there on that so I'm
not<00:02:49.320> gonna<00:02:49.470> go<00:02:49.650> into<00:02:49.800> exactly<00:02:50.250> what<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.460> do<00:02:50.580> for

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
not gonna go into exactly what I do for

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.350 
not gonna go into exactly what I do for
this<00:02:51.000> car<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:52.430> basically<00:02:53.430> want<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.030> turn<00:02:54.180> on

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
this car but basically want to turn on

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.410 
this car but basically want to turn on
the<00:02:54.480> key<00:02:54.660> everything<00:02:55.380> will<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.620> power<00:02:55.830> there

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
the key everything will get power there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.670 
the key everything will get power there
when<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.480> turn<00:02:57.660> off<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.960> key<00:02:58.140> it'll<00:02:58.380> all<00:02:58.470> go

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
when I turn off the key it'll all go

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.480 
when I turn off the key it'll all go
away

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
away

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.380 
away
mega<00:03:00.150> squirt<00:03:00.450> will<00:03:01.220> provide<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.520> fuel<00:03:03.120> pump

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
mega squirt will provide the fuel pump

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.910 
mega squirt will provide the fuel pump
power<00:03:03.660> though<00:03:04.340> through<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:06.770> cable<00:03:07.770> right

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
power though through this cable right

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.850 
power though through this cable right
here<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:09.300> separate<00:03:09.660> one<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> ran<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.530> actually

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
here so separate one I ran it's actually

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.560 
here so separate one I ran it's actually
two<00:03:11.010> cables<00:03:11.400> but<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.670> only<00:03:11.790> need<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.090> use<00:03:12.120> one<00:03:12.540> of

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
two cables but I only need to use one of

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.190 
two cables but I only need to use one of
them<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:14.550> should<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:16.020> power

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
them so that should do it for the power

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.620 
them so that should do it for the power
system
