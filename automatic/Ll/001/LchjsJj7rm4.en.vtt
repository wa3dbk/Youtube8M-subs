well my efforts to grow watercress can

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.520 
well my efforts to grow watercress can
be<00:00:05.100> considered<00:00:05.609> 100%<00:00:06.450> successful<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:08.090> mean

be considered 100% successful I mean
it's<00:00:10.530> just<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:11.070> matter<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.370> getting<00:00:11.429> an

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
flat flat not mineral water what to call

flat flat not mineral water what to call
spring<00:00:25.619> Wadi<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.789> spring<00:00:27.119> water<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.840> can't

spring Wadi is that spring water I can't

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.509 
spring Wadi is that spring water I can't
see<00:00:28.619> why<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> can't<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.490> another

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
see why now I can't do another

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.359 
see why now I can't do another
larger-scale<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.199> consider<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.980> costs

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
larger-scale if I consider that it costs

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.209 
larger-scale if I consider that it costs
money<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.759> buy<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> spring<00:00:33.420> water<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:35.100> it

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
money to buy a spring water and that it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.280 
money to buy a spring water and that it
costs<00:00:35.610> money<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.090> run<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> pump<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.780> suppose<00:00:37.110> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
costs money to run the pump I suppose it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.569 
costs money to run the pump I suppose it
costs<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:37.710> bit<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.040> money<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.399> run<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
costs a little bit of money to run the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.060 
costs a little bit of money to run the
pump<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.149> may<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.780> well<00:00:39.809> get<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> bathtub<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
pump I may as well get a bathtub me and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.299 
pump I may as well get a bathtub me and
I<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.149> old<00:00:42.300> bathtub<00:00:43.070> fill<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> with

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
I can get an old bathtub fill it with

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.569 
I can get an old bathtub fill it with
water<00:00:44.579> add<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> little<00:00:45.629> agricultural<00:00:46.559> lime<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
water add a little agricultural lime to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.170 
water add a little agricultural lime to
make<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> water<00:00:48.030> alkaline<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.980> put<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.030> an

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
make the water alkaline and put in an

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
make the water alkaline and put in an
aquarium<00:00:51.870> pump<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> same<00:00:52.559> pump<00:00:52.829> would<00:00:53.190> be

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
aquarium pump the same pump would be

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.939 
aquarium pump the same pump would be
enough<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.899> aerator<00:00:54.899> bathtub<00:00:55.500> wouldn't<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
enough to a aerator bathtub wouldn't it

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.150 
enough to a aerator bathtub wouldn't it
I<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.969> grow<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> large<00:00:57.360> amout<00:00:57.890> these<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:59.039> all

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
I can grow a large amout these are all

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
I can grow a large amout these are all
long<00:00:59.340> now<00:00:59.629> we're<00:01:00.629> getting<00:01:00.870> long<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.320> tall<00:01:02.660> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
long now we're getting long and tall so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.469 
long now we're getting long and tall so
I'll<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:04.019> able<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> harvest<00:01:04.650> them<00:01:04.860> soon<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
I'll be able to harvest them soon I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.399 
I'll be able to harvest them soon I
think<00:01:06.479> I'll<00:01:06.600> give<00:01:06.750> them<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.140> bit<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
fertilizer maybe to make the leaves a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.080 
fertilizer maybe to make the leaves a
bit<00:01:09.689> Russia<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.280> tiny<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.850> add<00:01:12.060> a
