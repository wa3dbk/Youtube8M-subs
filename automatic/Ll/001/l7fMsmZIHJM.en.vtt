00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
going to want to go ahead wipe it down

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.789 
going to want to go ahead wipe it down
with<00:02:23.390> some<00:02:23.569> kind<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.519> cleaner<00:02:25.519> afterwards<00:02:26.150> a

like a rubbing isopropyl alcohol type of
thing<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.640> oils<00:02:32.150> off<00:02:32.390> of

thing just to get all the oils off of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.190 
thing just to get all the oils off of
the<00:02:32.870> bulb<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.700> don't<00:02:34.910> do<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.329> then<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the bulb if you don't do that then the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.870 
the bulb if you don't do that then the
oils<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.709> cause<00:02:36.860> excessive<00:02:37.220> heat<00:02:37.549> to<00:02:37.670> build

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.850 
oils can cause excessive heat to build
up<00:02:38.000> in<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.360> bulb<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.810> cause<00:02:39.019> premature

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
up in the bulb and cause premature

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.699 
up in the bulb and cause premature
failure<00:02:40.190> you'll<00:02:40.760> be<00:02:40.880> replacing<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:41.930> again

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
failure you'll be replacing it in again

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.880 
failure you'll be replacing it in again
a<00:02:42.920> lot<00:02:43.130> sooner<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> we<00:02:45.230> can<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:45.500> plug<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.859> back

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
a lot sooner so we can just plug it back

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.130 
a lot sooner so we can just plug it back
and<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:47.090> plug<00:02:47.299> here<00:02:47.510> doesn't<00:02:47.840> matter<00:02:47.900> which

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
and the plug here doesn't matter which

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.860 
and the plug here doesn't matter which
one<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.320> goes<00:02:49.989> let<00:02:50.989> me<00:02:51.079> take<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> assembly

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
one it goes let me take the assembly

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.140 
one it goes let me take the assembly
screw<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.579> back<00:02:55.579> into<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> housing

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.120 

and<00:03:04.140> I'm<00:03:05.140> actually<00:03:05.290> going<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.620> go<00:03:05.740> ahead<00:03:05.860> and

clean up the whole side of here areas

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.380 
clean up the whole side of here areas
where<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.250> light<00:03:12.430> rubs<00:03:12.670> up<00:03:12.850> against<00:03:13.240> it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
where the the light rubs up against it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.260 
where the the light rubs up against it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
just to get any dirt out that might end

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.630 
just to get any dirt out that might end
up<00:03:16.420> causing<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.930> paint<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.290> wear<00:03:17.580> so<00:03:18.580> I'm

up causing the paint to wear so I'm

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.450 
up causing the paint to wear so I'm
going<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.620> okay<00:03:20.620> so<00:03:20.740> for<00:03:26.460> reassembly

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
going to do that okay so for reassembly

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.070 
going to do that okay so for reassembly
this<00:03:27.820> is<00:03:27.970> really<00:03:28.240> only<00:03:28.360> going<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.630> fit<00:03:28.810> in<00:03:28.900> one

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
this is really only going to fit in one

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.110 
this is really only going to fit in one
way<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.710> if<00:03:30.460> you<00:03:30.610> take<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> look<00:03:30.910> at<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
way for you if you take a look at the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.730 
way for you if you take a look at the
back<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.480> notice<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.720> few<00:03:31.930> pins<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.380> need<00:03:32.440> to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
back and notice a few pins that need to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.540 
back and notice a few pins that need to
slide<00:03:33.030> into<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.240> car<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.320> go<00:03:35.470> ahead<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:35.950> line

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
slide into the car so go ahead and line

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.970 
slide into the car so go ahead and line
those<00:03:36.760> up<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:38.940> push<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:39.970> light<00:03:40.330> back<00:03:40.540> in<00:03:40.980> then

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
those up and push the light back in then

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.380 
those up and push the light back in then

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
the screws and you're all done maybe a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.370 
the screws and you're all done maybe a
good<00:03:51.190> idea<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.670> go<00:03:51.790> ahead<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.150> just<00:03:52.390> test<00:03:53.260> your

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
good idea to go ahead and just test your

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.380 
good idea to go ahead and just test your
light<00:03:54.190> before<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:54.760> go<00:03:54.880> ahead<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.180> put<00:03:55.300> the

light before you go ahead and put the
assembly<00:03:55.570> back<00:03:55.930> together<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.820> know<00:03:58.210> put

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
assembly back together so you know put

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.460 
assembly back together so you know put
your<00:03:58.990> light<00:03:59.230> into<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.530> socket<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:01.260> go<00:04:02.260> turn

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
your light into the socket and go turn

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.750 
your light into the socket and go turn
your<00:04:02.620> lights<00:04:02.830> on<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.220> make<00:04:03.310> sure<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.610> the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
your lights on and make sure that the

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.170 
your lights on and make sure that the
new<00:04:03.880> bulb<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.300> working<00:04:05.490> you<00:04:06.490> know<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:06.790> not<00:04:06.910> a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
new bulb is working you know it's not a

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.400 
new bulb is working you know it's not a
real<00:04:07.210> big<00:04:07.540> deal<00:04:07.750> if<00:04:07.900> you're<00:04:08.050> not<00:04:08.140> putting<00:04:08.260> it

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
real big deal if you're not putting it

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.480 
real big deal if you're not putting it
back<00:04:08.500> together<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> it's<00:04:09.100> not<00:04:09.220> working

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
back together and it's not working

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.010 
back together and it's not working
because<00:04:10.000> it's<00:04:10.300> pretty<00:04:10.540> easy<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.810> take<00:04:10.900> apart

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
because it's pretty easy to take apart

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.680 
because it's pretty easy to take apart
but<00:04:11.610> anyway<00:04:12.610> hope<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:12.970> enjoyed<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.570> video
