00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Yes No 

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.630
 a greeting hdblog directors live 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.839
 from new york with the presentation of 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.749
 new nokia lumia 1020 a device 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:15.240
 which we have seen and which will be anticipated 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:17.849
 online through a series of photos and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.980
 images that some videos and that 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.320
 finally we can try and appreciate 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.839
 in all its design a device that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 we have here in black that resumes 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.720
 practically the aesthetic form 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.620
 dimensions and the body of the nokia lumia 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.780
 920 but find in the back a 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 really very very big goal e 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.719
 obviously optical carl zeiss 6 lenses 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.329
 for that they create the objective is precisely a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.850
 41 megapixels as flash resolution 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 xenon which allows us to have a time 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.519
 shooting with really paltry flash 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.829
 really fast two connectors one 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.100
 rear 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.929
 physical key for the camera to handle 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.570
 go activate or deactivate the device 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.700
 to launch the volume obviously in the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.630
 upside the 3.5 headphone jack 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.360
 mm and the connector for the micro sim the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.100
 upper microphone while at the side 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.060
 lower we find a large one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.450
 speaker the micro usb connector e 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.159
 a 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.380
 an input obviously the one I accept 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.399
 with something similar frontally i 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 classic soft touch and per keys 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.159
 as for a search and back is 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.250
 windows 8 windows phone 8 interface 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.470
 obviously classic formed by the files and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.569
 from the whole part of the applications 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.369
 marketplace that we now know well e 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.560
 are part of the nokia suite and of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.780
 windows phone is clearly the point of 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.439
 strength of this device is the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.039
 camera 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.709
 what we want to show you is that the 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.359
 phone is really very very thin 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:00.219
 as we who succeeded in 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.649
 compared to us who maintain 920 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.960
 practically identical thickness with 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.810
 just this little excrescence 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.019
 of the camera that is much lower than 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.049
 that of the notes by vote 108 but 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.450
 here partly resumes the resolution 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.400
 precisely of the camera as we see 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.530
 in the background we also have the version 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.819
 white that we inserted inside 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 of the accessory dedicated to the camera 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.980
 and to nokia photography is a 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.549
 accessory that besides allowing to 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.140
 have more photographic management 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.569
 effective with one hand then one 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.220
 immediate management of our photos with 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.739
 the possibility how you should shoot 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.160
 directly with the physical key that you 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.799
 find on for we find this too 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.840
 decidedly important camber that in 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.260
 actually hides a battery 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.269
 the internal battery is 1020 milian per 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.310
 which we also see a light indicator 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.650
 which tells us how much charge remains 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.840
 remains clearly replicated 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.109
 micro usb connector that allows us to 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.299
 recharge both the battery and the device 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.459
 once the external battery is 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.790
 the rest was clearly loaded 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.930
 of connection openings remains 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.730
 discovered therefore easy access and the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.410
 the back lens is surrounded 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.810
 from the case with this ring 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.410
 white in this case that just surrounds 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.690
 completely the goal 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.410
 in the lower part we find in this 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.450
 the classic entrance is also an accessory 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.830
 for the tripod that will allow us to 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.700
 enter our moons at 920 to be 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.890
 more on a tripod 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.560
 so we have a laptop like 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.870
 we can safely hook 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.640
 in the device now a hand awakes us 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.790
 a bit difficult however we can 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.850
 hook and then make the fire 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.330
 quietly with an external tripod 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.850
 this is therefore nokia lumia 1020 a 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.380
 general overview that we close with 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.920
 hardware specifications that see a 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.770
 4.5 inch display amoled hd thousand e 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.310
 then 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.970
 720p with 1280 x 768 pixel resolution 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.280
 2 gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.810
 of internal memory 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.310
 obviously front camera from 1.2 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.190
 megapixel dual core 1.5gb processor 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.080
 and obviously how we see the new one here 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.790
 camera interface there 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.970
 allows to have a version 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.710
 truly exceptional photo 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.170
 let's say not so much for the demos that 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.200
 we saw during the presentation 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.750
 how much because actually we have the 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.530
 possibility to create a series of 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.540
 filter options and interact with one 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.400
 set of settings that really there 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.740
 allow you to set any type 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.490
 of functionality any kind of 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.590
 option allowing even those who 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.910
 enjoys much of photography to have 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.620
 exposures and filters and settings for each 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.350
 opportunity as you see is then possible 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.750
 with the swype get into all of these 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.350
 single mode and therefore in a single 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.590
 screen or via 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.480
 the superior management of these of 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.770
 these shortcuts enter the various 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.200
 shooting options 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.450
 however we will see the camera and the 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.200
 quality of the camera in a focus 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.660
 dedicated focus that will speak precisely of 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.500
 all the features of the new year 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.020
 nokia pro cam functionality that the 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.850
 camera software that manages 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.830
 the goal from 41 megapixels nokia 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.920
 lumia millevele not only among all the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.220
 three of hdblog with the new lumia 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.220
 Milleventi
