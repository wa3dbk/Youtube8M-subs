00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.310
 I want to investigate with you or the concept of the bible 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.200
 the question for us this in this video is what is the bible 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 because we have 66 book yes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.960
 generous has god 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960
 another word 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.460
 and we are going to investigate the scriptures 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 to find the answers to those questions 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.170
 and we have two answers in the new testament that teach us that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020
 write writings are 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.740
 the word of God 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.320
 one that is 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 according to olé timoteo 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.840
 Persian 3 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.150
 as a boy, 15 to 17 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.350
 since childhood healthy raised more sacred scriptures which can you 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.269
 make wise 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.269
 for salvation to be done and that is in Jesus Christ 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.920
 all writing is inspired by god 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 and useful to teach 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.000
 cut age 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.180
 to correct 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.230
 to instruct in justice 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.160
 so that the name of God is perfect eternally prepared 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.890
 for all good work 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.040
 another script is 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.840
 second of pedro 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.420
 chapter 1 the psychologist 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 twenty 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.420
 inventiveness 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 no prophecy of the scriptures 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.850
 this private interpretation because the prophecy was never brought will 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.620
 human 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.780
 simón that the adults men of god to the announcement very inspired by which the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.580
 Holy Spirit 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.690
 according to these scriptures 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.740
 we know that the bible is something that both wrote 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.660
 because the instrument 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.939
 of men 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.310
 men who were chosen by god 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.690
 who wrote the scriptures 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.690
 under the inspiration of the holy spirit 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.910
 now 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.570
 our question has to see what scriptures really are the scriptures 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.329
 because we have 66 books 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.680
 you know we have the bible that is 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 I have made the new and the old testament 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.229
 and the old testament was written in the language of employment 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.469
 some parts were written well the language of aramaio part stephanie he 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.989
 for example 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.129
 and the new testament was written in the language of the world at that time 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.389
 the language of diego 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.230
 why 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.719
 we chose only this descent in three styles 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:55.229
 the book was written by prophets of the old testament the first prophet was 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.399
 I'm going 6 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.089
 samples wrote 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.679
 the toluca plant 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:02.679
 is that saying the first five books of the bible 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.340
 Genesis Exodus Levitical numbers 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.530
 and from another number these were the first books that were written and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.179
 they were written during the relief 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.179
 more or less in the year thousand 400 before Christ 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:21.409
 and the other text of the scriptures in the Old Testament were written 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.299
 after that time 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.239
 by other men who were chosen by God to write the scriptures 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:33.939
 and there are other scriptures too but they really are not the word of God there 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.189
 another thing is that they were written that are called going to bet and spa 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.679
 this book is called the daughter poker 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.559
 because they are the books that were written between the old testament 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.119
 and the time of the new testament 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.059
 the public filled with this book assisting 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.950
 are not 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.829
 books inspired by god is not that they are bad books 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.999
 his history books and also books that have 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.579
 ask for interesting things to pass 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.579
 but the scriptures are not only God's word 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.240
 they are history books that is to say that it is first and second of slaughterhouses 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.240
 it's not a bad book it's just not the scriptures 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.620
 and we recognize that they are the scriptures because the Jews never recognized 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.830
 this book as the scriptures 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.850
 that's why the modern church 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.180
 does not recognize those first 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.000
 in the new testament its little bit different because there are other books that 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.300
 they were written 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.569
 that we have not included a new testament 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.080
 and some have asked the question why we do not accept for example the gospel of 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.980
 tomás cobo the theater gospel because we do not use this former miners 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.180
 that were written in the 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.600
 first or maybe the second 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.659
 the title the second century 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.039
 and the answer is because there are so few books inspired by God 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.559
 they are books called sea 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.210
 Gospels of Gnosticism 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.030
 and it's not that the quake was of another religion 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.759
 who wanted to appear Christian 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.120
 and that's why I decided iron 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.349
 some books 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.229
 with their interesting doctrines but they were not doctrines that make up the 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.309
 writings 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:20.949
 that's why we do not use this book 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.389
 also that those books were not written under the inspiration of 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.529
 Holy Spirit 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.729
 and God never testified that this book serum lending books 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.029
 for example 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.169
 and integrated 2 chapter 2 verse 4 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.550
 Paul was talking about how God confirms 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.550
 the scriptures and he does it for Chinese 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.300
 witnessing to God with signs and wonders various miracles and 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.819
 repartimientos of the holy spirit 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.610
 according to your against 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.439
 now according to marquez the scriptures the question now is has other wounds 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:03.099
 words to say 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.919
 is developing now 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.729
 and this is a subject 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.710
 by josh brolin leao 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.270
 there are many Christians who think that they still speak by processes and 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.889
 archi holy god for chosen men and 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.410
 and that we Christians can talk 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.740
 in different tongues languages ​​of the angels 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.479
 but a question that I have and we want to start in the next nursery 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.779
 this is a Celtiberian hold-up and that's a question that really 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:34.150
 we need to investigate 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.699
 I hope this video 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.750
 it helps you in nothing to understand a little bit of 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.170
 because we have the bible and what is the bible 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:43.339
 God bless you
