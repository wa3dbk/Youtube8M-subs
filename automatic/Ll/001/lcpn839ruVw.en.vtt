00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.660 
here it's at 8 points so before we start
typing<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.349> guess<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.620> should<00:02:18.769> increase<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
typing I guess we should increase that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.020 
typing I guess we should increase that
to<00:02:19.730> say<00:02:20.720> 30<00:02:21.620> points<00:02:22.040> just<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.400> we<00:02:22.489> can<00:02:22.610> see<00:02:22.819> what

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to say 30 points just so we can see what

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.429 
to say 30 points just so we can see what
we're<00:02:23.180> right<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:23.689> can<00:02:23.840> change<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.290> size

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439 
we're right and we can change the size

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.660 
we're right and we can change the size
again<00:02:24.799> afterwards<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:26.659> let's<00:02:27.140> type<00:02:27.400> this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
again afterwards so let's type this

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.490 
again afterwards so let's type this
oh<00:02:30.849> it's<00:02:31.849> also<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.329> white<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.290> want<00:02:33.440> to

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
oh it's also in white so we want to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.350 
oh it's also in white so we want to
change<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.890> color<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.430> text<00:02:34.579> because

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
change the color of the text because

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.850 
change the color of the text because
obviously<00:02:35.599> we<00:02:35.840> can't<00:02:36.049> read<00:02:36.260> fight<00:02:36.530> against

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
obviously we can't read fight against

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.410 
obviously we can't read fight against
white<00:02:37.099> we're<00:02:37.370> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.579> change<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.000> color<00:02:38.209> to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
white we're going to change the color to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.039 
white we're going to change the color to
black<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.829> up<00:02:40.010> here<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.519> have<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.780> color

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
black so up here we have the color

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:49.000 
black so up here we have the color
palette<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.760> text<00:02:44.659> color<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:46.489> black<00:02:48.010> hit

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
palette so text color to black hit

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.009 
palette so text color to black hit
return<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.940> here<00:02:50.299> we<00:02:50.420> go<00:02:50.480> let's<00:02:50.510> start<00:02:50.900> typing

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
return so here we go let's start typing

00:02:51.019 --> 00:03:01.349 
return so here we go let's start typing
again<00:02:51.349> this<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:54.730> print<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.000> returned<00:02:59.359> a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
again this is a print and it returned a

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.410 
again this is a print and it returned a
four<00:03:02.470> page

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.150 

okay<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.500> next<00:03:07.650> thing<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.160> do<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.490> select<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
now we want to go command key on a Mac

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.480 
now we want to go command key on a Mac
and<00:03:24.170> drag<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.320> out<00:03:25.650> holding<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.190> shift

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
button so that it keeps the proportion

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.940 
button so that it keeps the proportion
of<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.030> text<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.600> dragged<00:03:31.230> out<00:03:31.380> again<00:03:31.680> using

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950

the shift button book but I call the
shift<00:03:34.080> button<00:03:34.290> there<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.739> I'll<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:36.270> again<00:03:36.690> and

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
shift button there so I'll go again and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.280 
shift button there so I'll go again and
know<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.739> how<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.610> print<00:03:39.540> page<00:03:39.810> hit

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
know it how this is a print page hit

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.500 
know it how this is a print page hit
return<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:42.090> we<00:03:42.180> go

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
return and there we go

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
return and there we go
so<00:03:43.380> let's<00:03:44.269> do<00:03:45.269> some<00:03:45.510> more<00:03:45.660> editing<00:03:45.870> here<00:03:46.380> on

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
so let's do some more editing here on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.080 
so let's do some more editing here on
the<00:03:48.170> paragraph<00:03:49.170> palette<00:03:49.800> we<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.190> set<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
the paragraph palette we can set the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.180 
the paragraph palette we can set the
paragraph<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.989> center<00:03:52.410> text<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:55.190> brings

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
paragraph to center text and that brings

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.990 
paragraph to center text and that brings
it<00:03:57.180> all<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.780> center<00:03:58.200> like<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.790> can

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
it all to the center like so we can

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.390 
it all to the center like so we can
underline<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.350> character<00:04:01.980> palate

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
underline it on the character palate

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:12.199 
underline it on the character palate
like<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.820> we<00:04:05.820> can<00:04:06.239> do<00:04:07.670> italics<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:10.820> let's<00:04:11.820> just

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
like so we can do italics and let's just

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.250 
like so we can do italics and let's just
say<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.810> want<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.290> put<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> shadow<00:04:13.799> on<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.340> text

like that let's go to normal and hit OK
now<00:04:54.810> all<00:04:54.990> we<00:04:55.140> got<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.289> do<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.740> go<00:04:56.340> file<00:04:57.890> print
