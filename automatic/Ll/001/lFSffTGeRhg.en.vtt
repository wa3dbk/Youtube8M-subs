very<00:02:34.800> capable<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.250> battle<00:02:35.550> but<00:02:35.640> then<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.850> have

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
very capable in battle but then you have

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.810 
very capable in battle but then you have
the<00:02:36.060> untested<00:02:36.390> people<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.050> vibe<00:02:37.260> who<00:02:37.980> kind

think could be interesting if they can

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760 
think could be interesting if they can
take<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.400> part<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.239> know<00:02:45.390> robots<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.650> know

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
take a part you know robots you know

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.250 
take a part you know robots you know
what<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.400> do<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.630> cyborg<00:02:48.630> yeah

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
what is that going to do to cyborg yeah

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
what is that going to do to cyborg yeah
I<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.860> was<00:02:49.950> mainly<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.280> setup<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.820> when

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
I think that was mainly a setup so when

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.660 
I think that was mainly a setup so when
it<00:02:51.090> comes<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.510> Trinity<00:02:51.900> war<00:02:52.430> just<00:02:53.430> League<00:02:53.580> of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
it comes to Trinity war just League of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.540 
it comes to Trinity war just League of
America<00:02:54.000> stands<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.269> chance<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.430> know

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
America stands a chance but you know

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.479 
America stands a chance but you know
some<00:02:56.760> other<00:02:57.530> team<00:02:58.530> dynamic<00:02:58.920> problems<00:02:59.280> with

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
some other team dynamic problems with

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.740

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
the dress League of America i think is

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.590

base which i think is the house of
secrets<00:04:26.830> that<00:04:27.250> Constantine<00:04:27.790> as<00:04:29.190> although<00:04:30.190> I

secrets that Constantine as although I

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.730 
secrets that Constantine as although I
think<00:04:30.280> they're<00:04:30.550> perceiving<00:04:30.910> just<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.360> dark

think they're perceiving just the dark

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.050 
think they're perceiving just the dark
kind<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:33.100> more<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.580> threat<00:04:33.730> than<00:04:33.850> they

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
kind of as more of a threat than they

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.020 
kind of as more of a threat than they
are<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.450> like<00:04:34.600> dark<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:35.080> very<00:04:35.730> less<00:04:36.730> of<00:04:36.910> a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030
