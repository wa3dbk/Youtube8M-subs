just a throwing knife everything else
doesn't<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.390> matter<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:04.170> could<00:01:04.320> want<00:01:04.589> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
doesn't really matter you could want you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.039 
doesn't really matter you could want you
to<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:05.010> off<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> flight<00:01:05.549> hand<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.630> dead<00:01:06.810> silence

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to go off a flight hand in dead silence

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.289 
to go off a flight hand in dead silence
but<00:01:07.770> i'd<00:01:08.010> recommend<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.790> allen<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but i'd recommend that it's allen so you

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.870 
but i'd recommend that it's allen so you
don't<00:01:09.479> die<00:01:09.950> when<00:01:10.950> he<00:01:10.979> hit<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.189> ground<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
don't die when he hit the ground so it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
don't die when he hit the ground so it
was<00:01:12.090> what's<00:01:12.240> gone<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> show<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.619> few

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
was what's gone to it show you a few

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
was what's gone to it show you a few
example<00:01:14.340> says<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:15.479> there

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
example says you see you see right there

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.929 
example says you see you see right there
I<00:01:16.280> thought<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> looks<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> pretty

I thought it looks like you got a pretty

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
I thought it looks like you got a pretty
high<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.049> actually<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
high and you can actually get up in that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
high and you can actually get up in that
tree<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:26.600> see<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.900> could<00:01:28.080> see
