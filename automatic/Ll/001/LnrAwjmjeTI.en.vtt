right<00:01:38.759> well<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> didn't<00:01:40.049> consider<00:01:40.409> was

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
right well what I didn't consider was

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the last step that I took the one that I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.950 
the last step that I took the one that I
put<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:42.899> my<00:01:43.049> weight<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.579> leap

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
put all my weight on to make that leap

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.069 
put all my weight on to make that leap
was<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.140> stabilized<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.250> broke

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
was not stabilized and I broke

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.210 
was not stabilized and I broke

be<00:03:34.829> really<00:03:35.340> dangerous<00:03:36.410> now<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.590> lucky<00:03:38.010> it's

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
be really dangerous now I'm lucky it's

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.879 
be really dangerous now I'm lucky it's
in<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.940> 20s<00:03:39.450> right<00:03:39.569> now<00:03:39.780> I'm<00:03:40.349> two<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.709> half

in the 20s right now I'm two and a half
miles<00:03:41.190> from<00:03:41.430> my<00:03:41.579> house<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.150> I'm<00:03:42.989> wet<00:03:43.440> up<00:03:43.650> to

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
miles from my house and I'm wet up to

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.729 
miles from my house and I'm wet up to
the<00:03:44.010> thigh<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.750> my<00:03:45.900> feet<00:03:46.139> are<00:03:46.169> dry<00:03:46.470> because

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
the thigh but my feet are dry because

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.539 
the thigh but my feet are dry because
i'm<00:03:47.040> prepared<00:03:47.220> i'm<00:03:48.260> prepared<00:03:49.260> because<00:03:49.950> i<00:03:50.190> know

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
i'm prepared i'm prepared because i know

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.000 
i'm prepared i'm prepared because i know
that<00:03:51.150> taking<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.109> little<00:03:52.349> steps<00:03:52.799> of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
that taking the little steps of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.699 
that taking the little steps of
preparation<00:03:53.760> are<00:03:54.079> going<00:03:55.079> to<00:03:55.260> make<00:03:55.440> those

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
preparation are going to make those

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.780 
preparation are going to make those
leaps<00:03:56.120> somewhat<00:03:57.120> safe<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.190> why<00:03:59.459> I'm<00:03:59.760> a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
leaps somewhat safe so this is why I'm a

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.539 
leaps somewhat safe so this is why I'm a
really<00:04:00.239> big<00:04:00.359> fan<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:00.750> tiny<00:04:01.410> steps<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.190> little

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
really big fan of tiny steps and little

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.610 
really big fan of tiny steps and little
leaps<00:04:02.810> because<00:04:03.810> things<00:04:04.019> like<00:04:04.139> this<00:04:04.440> can

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
leaps because things like this can

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.890 
leaps because things like this can
happen<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:05.609> big<00:04:05.790> leaps<00:04:06.090> can<00:04:06.599> be<00:04:06.720> dangerous

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
happen the big leaps can be dangerous

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.930 
happen the big leaps can be dangerous
unless<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:07.919> know<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.220> whole<00:04:08.340> picture<00:04:08.609> and

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
unless you know the whole picture and

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.750 
unless you know the whole picture and
it's<00:04:09.629> really<00:04:09.989> hard<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.459> whole

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
it's really hard to know the whole

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.670 
it's really hard to know the whole
picture<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.139> you're<00:04:13.260> making<00:04:13.530> a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
picture like when you're making a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.530 
picture like when you're making a
dietary<00:04:14.129> transformation<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.090> unless<00:04:15.359> you

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
dietary transformation and unless you

genetic<00:04:18.599> history<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.709> might<00:04:19.889> run<00:04:20.039> into<00:04:20.099> some

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
genetic history you might run into some

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.250 
genetic history you might run into some
problems<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:21.120> make<00:04:21.299> those<00:04:21.510> big<00:04:21.720> leaps<00:04:21.959> or

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
problems if you make those big leaps or

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.659 
problems if you make those big leaps or
if<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.530> don't<00:04:22.710> know<00:04:22.830> what's<00:04:23.039> going<00:04:23.520> on

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
if you don't know what's going on

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.969 
if you don't know what's going on
psychologically<00:04:24.570> or<00:04:24.690> if<00:04:25.469> you<00:04:25.620> don't<00:04:25.830> know

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
what's going on

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.150 
what's going on
with<00:04:27.080> another<00:04:27.289> person<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.889> you're<00:04:27.949> choosing

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
with another person that you're choosing

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.689 
with another person that you're choosing
to<00:04:28.370> partner<00:04:28.789> up<00:04:28.819> with<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.860> we<00:04:30.860> seldom<00:04:31.160> do<00:04:31.490> know

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
to partner up with and we seldom do know

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.540 
to partner up with and we seldom do know
these<00:04:31.910> things<00:04:32.889> so<00:04:33.889> when<00:04:33.979> you<00:04:34.099> take<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.310> little

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
these things so when you take a little

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.300 
these things so when you take a little
step<00:04:34.910> you're<00:04:35.630> going<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.810> get<00:04:35.900> some<00:04:36.080> evidence

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
step you're going to get some evidence

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.529 
step you're going to get some evidence
you're<00:04:37.310> going<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.520> find<00:04:37.729> out<00:04:37.940> okay<00:04:38.300> what's

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
you're going to find out okay what's

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.960 
you're going to find out okay what's
going<00:04:38.840> on<00:04:38.960> here<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.370> good<00:04:40.699> or<00:04:40.729> is<00:04:40.849> it

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
going on here and is it good or is it

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.700 
going on here and is it good or is it
bad<00:04:41.150> if<00:04:41.449> it's<00:04:41.630> bad<00:04:41.840> maybe<00:04:42.139> I<00:04:42.259> don't<00:04:42.500> want<00:04:42.620> to

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
bad if it's bad maybe I don't want to

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.159 
bad if it's bad maybe I don't want to
take<00:04:42.830> another<00:04:42.949> step<00:04:43.370> or<00:04:43.580> if<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.539> is<00:04:44.690> bad<00:04:44.900> is

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
take another step or if it is bad is

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.140 
take another step or if it is bad is
there<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.410> way<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.800> can<00:04:45.889> prepare<00:04:46.580> if<00:04:46.849> it

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
there a way that I can prepare if it

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.839 
there a way that I can prepare if it
gets<00:04:47.419> worse<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:48.139> there<00:04:48.919> something<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.430> can<00:04:49.490> do

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
gets worse is there something I can do

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.839 
gets worse is there something I can do
can<00:04:50.150> I<00:04:50.240> grow<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.620> can<00:04:51.710> handle<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.550> next

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
can I grow so that I can handle the next

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.029 
can I grow so that I can handle the next
step<00:04:53.289> or<00:04:54.289> do<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.560> just<00:04:54.680> walk<00:04:54.860> away<00:04:56.470> but<00:04:57.470> when<00:04:57.919> you

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
step or do I just walk away but when you

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.100 
step or do I just walk away but when you
take<00:04:58.190> those<00:04:58.370> big<00:04:58.610> steps<00:04:58.930> you're<00:04:59.930> often

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
take those big steps you're often

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.890 
take those big steps you're often
unprepared<00:05:00.889> because<00:05:01.610> you're<00:05:02.030> confident<00:05:02.630> and

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
unprepared because you're confident and

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.140 
unprepared because you're confident and
competent<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.590> why<00:05:04.190> should<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.520> be<00:05:04.729> prepared

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
competent and why should I be prepared

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.760 
competent and why should I be prepared
it's<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.389> small<00:05:05.690> jump<00:05:05.960> it's<00:05:06.110> eight<00:05:06.259> to<00:05:06.380> ten<00:05:06.560> feet

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
it's a small jump it's eight to ten feet

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.370 
it's a small jump it's eight to ten feet
I<00:05:06.830> can<00:05:07.099> do<00:05:07.220> that<00:05:07.509> but<00:05:08.509> I<00:05:08.569> never<00:05:08.810> considered<00:05:09.229> the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
I can do that but I never considered the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.520 
I can do that but I never considered the
ice<00:05:09.590> and<00:05:10.069> many<00:05:10.490> people<00:05:10.669> don't<00:05:10.940> consider<00:05:11.530> their

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
ice and many people don't consider their

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.850 
ice and many people don't consider their
own<00:05:12.680> personal<00:05:14.229> challenges<00:05:15.229> when<00:05:15.560> they<00:05:15.650> take

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
own personal challenges when they take

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.839 
own personal challenges when they take
these<00:05:16.039> big<00:05:16.220> leaps<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.990> be<00:05:17.990> careful<00:05:18.580> take<00:05:19.580> two

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
these big leaps so be careful take two

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.879 
these big leaps so be careful take two
little<00:05:20.240> steps<00:05:20.509> forward<00:05:20.990> get<00:05:21.710> some

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
little steps forward get some

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.490 
little steps forward get some
information<00:05:22.159> then<00:05:23.030> take<00:05:23.330> one<00:05:23.360> step<00:05:23.870> back<00:05:23.930> is

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
information then take one step back is

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.219 
information then take one step back is
it<00:05:25.340> safe<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.789> go<00:05:25.940> ahead<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:26.569> there<00:05:26.810> something<00:05:27.139> I

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
it safe to go ahead is there something I

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.600 
it safe to go ahead is there something I
need<00:05:27.409> to<00:05:27.440> learn<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:27.889> there<00:05:28.039> something<00:05:28.370> i<00:05:28.460> need

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
need to learn is there something i need

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.760 
need to learn is there something i need
to<00:05:28.639> prepare<00:05:28.849> before<00:05:29.419> i<00:05:29.449> go<00:05:29.630> back<00:05:29.810> again<00:05:29.990> then

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
to prepare before i go back again then

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.580 
to prepare before i go back again then
take<00:05:31.009> two<00:05:31.219> steps<00:05:31.280> forward<00:05:31.659> learn<00:05:32.659> investigate

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
take two steps forward learn investigate

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.330 
take two steps forward learn investigate
collect<00:05:34.099> data<00:05:34.400> take<00:05:35.090> one<00:05:35.270> step<00:05:35.509> back<00:05:36.190> it's<00:05:37.190> a

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
collect data take one step back it's a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.360 
collect data take one step back it's a
slower<00:05:37.780> process<00:05:38.780> but<00:05:39.770> it's<00:05:39.889> a<00:05:39.949> much<00:05:40.130> safer

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
slower process but it's a much safer

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.930 
slower process but it's a much safer
process<00:05:41.889> sometimes<00:05:42.889> you<00:05:43.070> have<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:43.520> take<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.699> big

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
process sometimes you have to take a big

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.330 
process sometimes you have to take a big
leap<00:05:43.969> you<00:05:44.630> don't<00:05:44.900> have<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.080> choice<00:05:45.349> but<00:05:46.310> by

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
leap you don't have a choice but by

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.580 
leap you don't have a choice but by
doing<00:05:46.520> these<00:05:46.909> little<00:05:47.300> steps<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:47.840> learning

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
doing these little steps and learning

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.060 
doing these little steps and learning
and<00:05:48.740> growing<00:05:49.159> and<00:05:49.539> preparing<00:05:50.539> yourself

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
and growing and preparing yourself

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.730 
and growing and preparing yourself
you're<00:05:52.070> gonna<00:05:52.370> as<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.870> did<00:05:54.080> today<00:05:54.320> have<00:05:54.710> a

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
you're gonna as I did today have a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.439 
you're gonna as I did today have a
better<00:05:54.979> chance<00:05:55.039> of<00:05:55.430> surviving<00:05:55.969> the<00:05:56.060> big<00:05:56.180> leaps

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
better chance of surviving the big leaps

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.689 
better chance of surviving the big leaps
but<00:05:56.659> even<00:05:56.960> then<00:05:57.110> there's<00:05:57.319> no<00:05:57.469> guarantee<00:05:57.919> so

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:58.699 
but even then there's no guarantee so

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.860 
but even then there's no guarantee so
little<00:05:59.030> steps<00:06:03.520> go<00:06:04.520> home<00:06:04.729> before<00:06:04.909> my<00:06:05.330> pants

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
little steps go home before my pants
