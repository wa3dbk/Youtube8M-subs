how<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> game<00:01:35.220> calculates<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:37.430> your<00:01:38.430> nation

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
how the game calculates out your nation

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
how the game calculates out your nation
size<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.740> provinces<00:01:41.310> based<00:01:41.579> tax

size it's all your provinces based tax

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 
size it's all your provinces based tax
and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.899> believe<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.470> half<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.009> base<00:01:44.189> tax<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and I believe it's half the base tax of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.289 
and I believe it's half the base tax of
vassals<00:01:45.860> but<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> doesn't<00:01:47.610> take<00:01:48.000> into

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
vassals but what it doesn't take into

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.530 
vassals but what it doesn't take into
account<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.740> base<00:01:50.070> tax<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.640> marches<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
account is the base tax of marches and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.679 
account is the base tax of marches and
your<00:01:55.219> personal<00:01:56.219> unions<00:01:56.640> which<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.450> don't<00:01:57.570> have

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
decision it's very easy and it works to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.890 
decision it's very easy and it works to
our<00:02:46.060> advantage<00:02:46.269> quite<00:02:47.049> well<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:49.000> after<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.269> lot

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900

accept it as long as it's you don't ask
for<00:03:11.349> money<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:12.250> something<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:12.700> they

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
for money and it's something that they

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.000 
for money and it's something that they
can<00:03:12.880> core<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:15.730> instance<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.799> see<00:03:17.980> that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
can core for instance you can see that

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.339 
can core for instance you can see that
they'll<00:03:18.819> take<00:03:19.150> this<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.900> they<00:03:19.989> won't<00:03:20.170> take

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
they'll take this but they won't take

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.430 
they'll take this but they won't take
they<00:03:20.980> won't<00:03:21.160> take<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.459> goes<00:03:21.670> too<00:03:21.880> far<00:03:22.090> away

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
they won't take this goes too far away

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.569 
they won't take this goes too far away
so<00:03:23.440> that's<00:03:23.560> kind<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.769> why<00:03:23.889> we<00:03:24.040> have<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.280> sell<00:03:24.549> it

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
so that's kind of why we have to sell it

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.420 
so that's kind of why we have to sell it
in<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.980> pattern<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.669> do<00:03:28.709> now<00:03:29.709> at

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
in the in the pattern that we do now at

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.210 
in the in the pattern that we do now at
the<00:03:30.579> same<00:03:30.760> time<00:03:31.169> that<00:03:32.169> you're<00:03:32.290> doing<00:03:32.410> this<00:03:32.680> you

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
the same time that you're doing this you

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.860 
the same time that you're doing this you
could<00:03:33.370> take<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> little<00:03:33.609> bit<00:03:33.790> longer<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:35.099> use

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
could take a little bit longer and use

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.289 
could take a little bit longer and use
you<00:03:37.870> use<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.470> extra<00:03:38.709> time<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:39.010> form<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.819> claim

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
you use the extra time to form a claim

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.750 
you use the extra time to form a claim
on<00:03:40.480> Danzig<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.310> are<00:03:42.430> going<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.639> need

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
on Danzig because you are going to need

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.020 
on Danzig because you are going to need
that<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.919> form<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.010> Commonwealth<00:03:45.459> later<00:03:45.730> or

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
that to form the Commonwealth later or

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.280 
that to form the Commonwealth later or
you<00:03:46.720> could<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.310> save<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.549> people<00:03:49.060> in<00:03:49.329> shale

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
you could just save the people in shale

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.720 
you could just save the people in shale
now<00:03:50.519> you're<00:03:51.519> always<00:03:51.639> gonna<00:03:51.819> get<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.120> mission

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
now you're always gonna get that mission

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.789 
now you're always gonna get that mission
where<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.849> roses<00:03:55.349> really<00:03:56.349> sucks<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.680> be

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
where the roses really sucks to be

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.030 
where the roses really sucks to be
England<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.940> keep<00:03:58.120> selling<00:03:58.329> stuff<00:03:58.630> off<00:04:02.040> we
