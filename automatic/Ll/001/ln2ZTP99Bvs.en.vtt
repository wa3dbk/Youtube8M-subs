I<00:00:33.420> find<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.230> cumbersome<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.550> no<00:00:35.730> advantage

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270

I find them cumbersome to no advantage
in<00:00:36.630> any<00:00:36.780> way<00:00:37.340> go<00:00:38.340> for<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> want<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
in any way go for it if you want the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
in any way go for it if you want the
tuning<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.420> G<00:00:43.160> B<00:00:44.160> D<00:00:45.200> and<00:00:47.030> G<00:00:48.680> B<00:00:49.760> D<00:00:51.020> these<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.199> sort

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
tuning is G B D and G B D these are sort

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
tuning is G B D and G B D these are sort
of<00:00:52.559> like

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
of like

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.690 
of like
the<00:00:55.079> notes<00:00:55.290> of<00:00:55.470> a<00:00:55.560> major<00:00:55.710> chord<00:00:56.130> repeated

the notes of a major chord repeated

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.100 
the notes of a major chord repeated
twice<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.329> I'm<00:00:57.450> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> guess<00:00:57.900> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.290> G<00:01:00.110> G

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
twice and I'm going to guess this is G G

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.320 
twice and I'm going to guess this is G G
B<00:01:01.260> D

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.720 

it<00:01:05.810> makes<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.170> kind<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.500> funny<00:01:06.740> court<00:01:07.100> but

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
it makes it kind of a funny court but

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.760 
it makes it kind of a funny court but
you<00:01:08.300> get<00:01:08.480> a<00:01:08.510> guy<00:01:08.690> like<00:01:08.720> Jerry<00:01:09.140> Douglas<00:01:09.350> playing

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770

you get a guy like Jerry Douglas playing
this<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.220> he<00:01:10.310> will<00:01:10.580> blow<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.060> away
