and<00:01:14.900> sonic<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.250> says

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
and sonic that's what I think it says

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.940 
and sonic that's what I think it says
cool<00:01:19.490> there's<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.200> there's<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> red<00:01:22.530> light

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.969 
cool there's and there's a red light
that<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:24.900> sure<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that so you can make sure it's on and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.420 
that so you can make sure it's on and
then<00:01:26.330> when<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.479> turn<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> remote<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
black and then it's spy gear in the name
and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.869> go<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and then there we go this is what the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.330 
and then there we go this is what the
car<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.640> seeing<00:01:36.439> right<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:39.920> all<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:40.979> now

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
car is seeing right now all right now

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.280 
car is seeing right now all right now
it's<00:01:41.880> looking<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.930> wall<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
it's looking at the wall and this is the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.859 
it's looking at the wall and this is the
night<00:01:46.290> vision<00:01:46.799> mode<00:01:47.130> it's<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.820> green<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
night vision mode it's all green but it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.980 
night vision mode it's all green but it
does<00:01:49.619> work<00:01:50.009> when<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.640> actually<00:01:51.390> pitch<00:01:51.659> dark

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
does work when it's actually pitch dark

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.550 
does work when it's actually pitch dark
it's<00:01:52.140> pretty<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.880> there's<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.869> sign

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
it's pretty good and then there's a sign

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.770 
it's pretty good and then there's a sign
up<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> corner<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> battery

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
up here in the corner for the battery

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.170 
up here in the corner for the battery
level<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.430> here<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
level and here I think it's for the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.170 
level and here I think it's for the
radar<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.159> then<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> turn<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.820> night

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
radar and then when you turn on night

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.520 
radar and then when you turn on night
vision<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.310> red<00:02:05.610> eye<00:02:06.290> here

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
vision there so there's a red eye here

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.350 
vision there so there's a red eye here
meaning<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:07.950> um<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> night<00:02:08.700> vision<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.179> on

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
meaning that um the night vision is on

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.930 
meaning that um the night vision is on
and

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.480 
and
as<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.930> mentioned<00:02:12.380> before<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.740> was<00:02:12.890> 100<00:02:13.340> feet

as I mentioned before I was 100 feet

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.060 
as I mentioned before I was 100 feet
through<00:02:13.700> walls<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.240> on<00:02:14.740> see<00:02:15.740> here<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
through walls and on see here the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.820 
through walls and on see here the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
plastic mix it it's easily see on the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.920 
plastic mix it it's easily see on the
ground<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.160> doesn't<00:02:22.460> slip<00:02:22.910> when<00:02:23.750> it's

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
ground so it doesn't slip when it's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.490 
ground so it doesn't slip when it's
going<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.650> that's<00:02:25.010> pretty<00:02:25.190> cool<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.790> um<00:02:26.500> yeah
