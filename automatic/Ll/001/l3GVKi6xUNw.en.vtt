on<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.500> which<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.799> interesting<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.340> you're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
on one which is interesting that you're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
on one which is interesting that you're
doing<00:01:11.820> basically<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> game<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> week<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
doing basically a game a week at this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
doing basically a game a week at this
point<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> here's<00:01:15.119> here's<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> first<00:01:15.659> one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
point so here's here's the first one

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.219 
point so here's here's the first one
Jeremy<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.369> Bucs<00:01:17.729> over<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
Jeremy we have the Bucs over the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.620 
Jeremy we have the Bucs over the
Cardinals<00:01:19.820> now<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:20.939> pulling<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.360> out

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Cardinals now I'm pulling this one out

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
Cardinals now I'm pulling this one out
because<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.590> benched<00:01:22.890> Josh<00:01:23.220> Freeman

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
because they just benched Josh Freeman

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.880 
because they just benched Josh Freeman
so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.570> reinvigorates<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so I think this reinvigorates the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.340 
so I think this reinvigorates the
offense<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.790> get<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
offense they get it going they have to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.749 
offense they get it going they have to
win<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> coach<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.490> they<00:01:29.579> don't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
win for the coach because if they don't

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.179 
win for the coach because if they don't
win<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.420> coach<00:01:30.689> could<00:01:31.140> potentially<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.799> out

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
win this coach could potentially be out

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.710 
win this coach could potentially be out
of<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:32.759> Tampa<00:01:33.060> Bay<00:01:33.210> has<00:01:33.390> sucked

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
of there because Tampa Bay has sucked

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780 
of there because Tampa Bay has sucked
for<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.290> many<00:01:34.470> years<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:35.310> got<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.670> at

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
for so many years they got to get at

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.069 
for so many years they got to get at
least<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.119> win<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.869> they<00:01:36.960> could

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
least one win and I think they could

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
least one win and I think they could
beat<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> Cardinals<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> coach

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
beat the Cardinals not so the coach

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.030 
beat the Cardinals not so the coach
should<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.450> either<00:01:39.600> Gratiano<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.799> worst

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
should be either Gratiano is the worst

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.340 
should be either Gratiano is the worst
coach<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.520> ever<00:01:41.670> seen<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.210> an<00:01:42.329> NFL<00:01:42.479> level<00:01:42.930> he

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
coach I've ever seen on an NFL level he

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
coach I've ever seen on an NFL level he
has<00:01:43.890> done<00:01:44.100> unspeakable<00:01:44.250> things<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
has done unspeakable things to the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.760 
has done unspeakable things to the
quarterback<00:01:45.600> situation<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.500> they<00:01:46.710> were

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
quarterback situation they they were

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710 
quarterback situation they they were
fine<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.310> Friedman<00:01:47.790> rolling<00:01:48.149> along<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
fine with Friedman rolling along and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.270 
fine with Friedman rolling along and
they<00:01:49.110> drafted<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.710> guy<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.130> they're

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
they drafted this guy now they're

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
they drafted this guy now they're
throwing<00:01:50.610> him<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.880> doesn't<00:01:51.509> make<00:01:51.600> any<00:01:51.810> sense

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
throwing him in doesn't make any sense

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.690 
throwing him in doesn't make any sense
i'm<00:01:52.350> taking<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> Cardinals<00:01:53.159> it's<00:01:53.549> all<00:01:53.670> about

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
i'm taking the Cardinals it's all about

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460 
i'm taking the Cardinals it's all about
how<00:01:53.970> Glennon<00:01:54.299> plays<00:01:54.479> Mike<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.049> plays<00:01:55.259> well

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
how Glennon plays Mike if he plays well

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.410 
how Glennon plays Mike if he plays well
they<00:01:55.649> win<00:01:55.860> he<00:01:56.490> doesn't<00:01:56.790> play<00:01:56.909> well<00:01:57.060> there's

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
they win he doesn't play well there's

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.359 
they win he doesn't play well there's
one<00:01:57.570> history<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> unknown

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
one history I think it's the unknown

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.899 
one history I think it's the unknown
factor<00:01:59.579> now<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.329> saw<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.810> when<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> Browns

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
factor now you saw this when the Browns

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.219 
factor now you saw this when the Browns
played<00:02:02.909> over<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> weekend<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.079> unknown

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
played over the weekend the unknown

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
played over the weekend the unknown
factor<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.979> quarterback<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
factor of the quarterback and the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.670 
factor of the quarterback and the
running<00:02:06.180> back<00:02:06.329> situation<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:07.170> rounds<00:02:07.469> pulled

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
running back situation the rounds pulled

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.169 
running back situation the rounds pulled
out<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> win<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.879> that's<00:02:09.000> what

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
out a win and I think that's what

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.999 
out a win and I think that's what
happens<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.690> Bucs<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.410> shotgun<00:02:10.890> I'd

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
happens to the Bucs I was a shotgun I'd

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
happens to the Bucs I was a shotgun I'd
be<00:02:11.099> shocked<00:02:11.370> at<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.610> bottle<00:02:11.879> Jeremy<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.660> would

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
be shocked at the bottle Jeremy I would

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.000 
be shocked at the bottle Jeremy I would
also<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.470> ad<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.620> have

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
also like the ad I have

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.720 
also like the ad I have
new<00:02:14.159> ranking<00:02:14.909> system<00:02:15.299> it's<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.349> combine<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
new ranking system it's I combine the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.420 
new ranking system it's I combine the
wagers<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.140> winning<00:02:19.409> money<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.069> safe

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
wagers of like winning money and safe

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.759 
wagers of like winning money and safe
teenis<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> very<00:02:22.230> big<00:02:22.500> risk

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
teenis this this is the very big risk

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.710 
teenis this this is the very big risk
factor<00:02:23.189> so<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.579> is<00:02:23.730> I'm<00:02:24.090> gonna<00:02:24.299> give<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.599> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
factor so this is I'm gonna give it a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.530 
factor so this is I'm gonna give it a
hangover<00:02:25.260> +<00:02:26.010> 10<00:02:26.280> rating<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.909> is<00:02:27.030> very<00:02:27.239> risky

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
hangover + 10 rating this is very risky

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.530 
hangover + 10 rating this is very risky
but<00:02:28.079> can<00:02:28.230> pay<00:02:28.500> off<00:02:28.530> very<00:02:29.340> very<00:02:29.489> well<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
but can pay off very very well the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.630 
but can pay off very very well the
higher<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.810> number<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.709> hangover<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.459> more

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
higher the number of hangover the more

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.539 
higher the number of hangover the more
risk<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.180> more<00:02:33.629> risk<00:02:33.900> but<00:02:34.110> also<00:02:34.140> means<00:02:34.890> more

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
risk it is more risk but also means more

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.729 
risk it is more risk but also means more
money<00:02:35.579> because<00:02:36.390> it's<00:02:36.599> like<00:02:36.750> 10<00:02:37.200> drinks<00:02:37.470> last

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
money because it's like 10 drinks last

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.750 
money because it's like 10 drinks last
