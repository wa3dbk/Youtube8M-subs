00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
bike the reason for this glitch is the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.830 
bike the reason for this glitch is the
reason<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.210> need<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.390> bike<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.720> this

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
reason for you need the bike for this

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.660 
reason for you need the bike for this
glitch<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.080> because<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.680> bike<00:03:01.890> reads<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.460> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
glitch is because the bike reads as the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.540 
glitch is because the bike reads as the
car<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.960> when<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.880> rockstar<00:03:06.780> thinks<00:03:07.140> that

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
car so when you so rockstar thinks that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.810 
car so when you so rockstar thinks that
you<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.810> got<00:03:10.140> ordered<00:03:10.710> another<00:03:10.950> car

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
which you didn't and um so the bike

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.540 
which you didn't and um so the bike
reads<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.680> car<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.550> you're<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.940> UM<00:03:18.120> no
