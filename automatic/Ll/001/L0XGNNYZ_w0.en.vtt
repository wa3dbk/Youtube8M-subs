00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
without further ado let's get straight

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
without further ado let's get straight
to<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.309> concept<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.239> Pokedex<00:00:54.780> which<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to this concept of the Pokedex which you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
to this concept of the Pokedex which you
guys<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.530> been<00:00:55.680> asking<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.190> heaps<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.360> well

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
guys have been asking for heaps as well

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.420 
guys have been asking for heaps as well
so<00:00:58.320> let's<00:00:58.500> see<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.920> press<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.370> button

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
so let's see if I press this button

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
so let's see if I press this button
you'll<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> now<00:01:00.870> have<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.079> pokedex<00:01:01.440> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you'll see that I now have a pokedex in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.369 
you'll see that I now have a pokedex in
my<00:01:01.800> hand<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.879> texture<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> pretty<00:01:03.600> cool<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
my hand the texture is pretty cool in a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.690 
my hand the texture is pretty cool in a
moment<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.949> actually<00:01:05.250> we're<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> open

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
moment so actually we're going to open

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.359 
moment so actually we're going to open
it<00:01:05.820> right<00:01:05.939> now<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.070> an

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it right now you can see that we have an

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
it right now you can see that we have an
entry<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.689> proof<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.960> concept<00:01:10.110> by

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
entry this is just a proof of concept by

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
entry this is just a proof of concept by
the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.330> an<00:01:12.450> entry<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.869> that's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the way so we have an entry here that's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.350 
the way so we have an entry here that's
empty<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.590> course<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> first<00:01:14.580> Pokemon<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
empty of course the first Pokemon in the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.520 
empty of course the first Pokemon in the
Pokedex<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> lriend

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
Pokedex is lriend

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.310 
Pokedex is lriend
with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> grass<00:01:17.610> pokemon<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.869> obviously<00:01:19.229> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
with the grass pokemon so obviously I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.130 
with the grass pokemon so obviously I
have<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.650> seen<00:01:19.890> Elrond<00:01:20.340> yet<00:01:20.930> just<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
have not seen Elrond yet just for this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.910 
have not seen Elrond yet just for this
video<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.560> course

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
video of course

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
video of course

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
information so this is just a proof of

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.950 
information so this is just a proof of
concept<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.860> okay<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.850> works<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:00.899> I

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

brilliant<00:02:31.590> minds<00:02:31.830> noticed<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.310> don't<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
brilliant minds noticed I don't have the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.550 
brilliant minds noticed I don't have the
red<00:02:33.030> tint<00:02:33.330> that's<00:02:33.690> because<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.230> command

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
red tint that's because this command

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.980 
red tint that's because this command
block<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.860> actually<00:02:35.130> doing<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.640> me<00:02:35.990> so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
block is actually doing that for me so

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.070

as<00:02:37.290> soon<00:02:37.410> as<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.590> give<00:02:37.770> myself<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:39.720> new

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
as soon as I give myself the the new

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.110 
as soon as I give myself the the new
pokedex<00:02:40.620> it'll<00:02:40.800> be<00:02:40.920> red<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.580> if<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> view<00:02:41.970> this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
pokedex it'll be red so if I view this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.260 
pokedex it'll be red so if I view this
again<00:02:42.540> empty<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:44.190> what<00:02:44.490> happens<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.210> soon

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
again empty but what happens is as soon

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.520 
again empty but what happens is as soon
as<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.570> view<00:02:45.630> lriend

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
as I view lriend

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.880 
as I view lriend
this<00:02:47.040> gets<00:02:47.250> updated<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.150> show<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.470> text

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
this gets updated to show the the text

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.160 
this gets updated to show the the text
now<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.430> SLR<00:02:50.790> int<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> logo<00:02:51.720> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
now it's SLR int with the logo the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.740 
now it's SLR int with the logo the
appropriate<00:02:52.590> logo<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.100> number<00:02:53.460> one<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.850> then

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
appropriate logo and number one and then

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.210 
appropriate logo and number one and then
if<00:02:55.050> I<00:02:55.170> update<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.710> Pokedex

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
if I update the Pokedex

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.490 
if I update the Pokedex
and<00:02:56.730> deal<00:02:56.940> what<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.660> see<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:57.960> SLR<00:02:58.380> int

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
and deal what you can see it's SLR int

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.980 
and deal what you can see it's SLR int
so<00:02:59.070> that's<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.880> very<00:03:00.060> basic<00:03:00.270> proof<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.660> concept

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
so that's a very basic proof of concept

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.210 
so that's a very basic proof of concept
for<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.140> Pokedex<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:01.740> what<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:01.980> kind<00:03:02.130> of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
for the Pokedex that's what it kind of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.740 
for the Pokedex that's what it kind of
looks<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.330> guys<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.630> any

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
looks like if you guys have any

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.690 
looks like if you guys have any
suggestions<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.190> about<00:03:05.580> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
suggestions for what you think about the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.340 
suggestions for what you think about the
Pokedex<00:03:06.090> how<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.300> looks<00:03:06.510> if<00:03:06.960> you'd<00:03:07.110> like<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
Pokedex how it looks if you'd like to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.260 
Pokedex how it looks if you'd like to
see<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.650> change<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:08.190> some<00:03:08.370> way<00:03:08.400> make<00:03:09.120> sure<00:03:09.150> to

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
see it change in some way make sure to
