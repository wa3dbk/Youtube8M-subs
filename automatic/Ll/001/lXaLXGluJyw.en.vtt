00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.200 
hi I'm Rachel for expert village on this
cake<00:00:04.620> we're<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> start<00:00:05.640> with<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.819> egg

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
cake we're going to start with the egg

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.459 
cake we're going to start with the egg
whites<00:00:06.710> because<00:00:08.300> we<00:00:09.300> need<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> egg<00:00:10.200> yolks

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
whites because we need for the egg yolks

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.339 
whites because we need for the egg yolks
to<00:00:10.920> mix<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.370> self-rising<00:00:11.969> flour<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.809> since

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
to mix the self-rising flour and since

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.870 
to mix the self-rising flour and since
it's<00:00:13.530> not<00:00:13.679> good<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.160> self-rising<00:00:14.700> flour

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it's not good for the self-rising flour

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660 
it's not good for the self-rising flour
to<00:00:15.240> stand<00:00:15.509> too<00:00:15.839> long<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.289> mix<00:00:16.590> that's<00:00:17.340> why

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
to stand too long in the mix that's why

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.689 
to stand too long in the mix that's why
where<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.600> started<00:00:18.990> before<00:00:19.340> with<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.520> egg

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
where we started before with the egg

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.599 
where we started before with the egg
yolks<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.740> now<00:00:22.740> we're<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> start<00:00:23.490> with

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
yolks and now we're going to start with

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.990 
yolks and now we're going to start with
the<00:00:23.760> egg<00:00:23.880> whites<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.430> mentioned<00:00:26.460> before

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the egg whites so as I mentioned before

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.710 
the egg whites so as I mentioned before
where<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.840> made<00:00:28.349> sure<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.740> there<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.010> no<00:00:29.720> egg

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
where I made sure that there is no egg

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.139 
where I made sure that there is no egg
yolks<00:00:31.019> inside<00:00:31.560> plus<00:00:32.520> we're<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> add

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
yolks inside plus we're going to add

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.229 
yolks inside plus we're going to add
half<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> amount<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.559> sugar<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
half of the amount of sugar into the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:52.650 
half of the amount of sugar into the
mixture<00:00:37.079> after<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> starts<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:39.500> get<00:00:40.500> sloppy

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.550 

this<00:00:53.230> is<00:00:53.380> much<00:00:53.590> weaker<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.340> course<00:00:54.670> but<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.090> has

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
this is much weaker of course but it has

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:10.890 
this is much weaker of course but it has
legs<00:00:56.560> a<00:00:56.950> bit<00:00:57.820> quicker<00:00:58.300> than<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.720> other<00:00:58.840> one

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900
