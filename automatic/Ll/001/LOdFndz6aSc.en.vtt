though<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.570> reason<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.649> one

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
though the reason that I like this one

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.580 
though the reason that I like this one
though<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.759> very<00:02:09.629> dark<00:02:09.929> black<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
though is it is a very dark black and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.590 
though is it is a very dark black and
less<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.520> waterline

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
long as this one it lasts longer than

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.300
