 SID 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.080
 Hello this year will show how they view their clipboard and 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.619
 can also mix 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 The whole thing works by means of a Windows own program next 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 Windows XP is still standard 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.070
 in Vista and 7 there's extra video's the same thing 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.070
 no longer in the form that Nico Matic now gives history 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.400
 on the Vaal from the finish is the XPS One videos coming in to like 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.080
 Operating systems below 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.110
 good what can you do with these 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.760
 Bortfeldt once said this notice as saying that 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.190
 See clipboard 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.560
 under tables Pad Desktop Link can like the whole then also manually 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.280
 Clear 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.870
 because the clipboard 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.910
 and Proteros has Sion 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.780
 Maurice AndrÃ© Malter right click new order RTF document 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.990
 it's still about the group theirs 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.960
 and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.300
 now ours always call 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.900
 Program he needs 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.930
 Years - and run and give here 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.990
 stick Dr like one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.920
 for clip on 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.150
 Specify exactly and now we have ours 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.520
 Filing Marple clipboard 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 and then she stopped painting 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.440
 Document copy especially the US Defense document 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.890
 right-click 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.270
 Copy 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.900
 then they will be right here in the clipboard 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.870
 to the left 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.280
 Copy and now you are on the clipboard 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 the path to the game f 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560
 document 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 if, for example, a picture copy, the whole is also inserted here 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.980
 and 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.170
 by means of this function one can read out where please Sebastien 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.940
 Kaschke is saved 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.550
 I've already wanted an example addressed these breaks when 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.790
 for example, they work in the office it says 12 o'clock with 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.350
 and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.200
 they leave the PC and keep clearing between but completely clear 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.550
 there are no opportunities either si 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.010
 just copy something else into the clipboard, for example because of times 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.979
 the bin 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.539
 cool bad example great copying then just this life 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:15.519
 this link decorates her Sako Piranesi or Mozilla Firefox all lies 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.749
 in the clipboard then what they have copied before because of me 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.379
 the balance is from last year 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
 you would be deleted from between memory 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.310
 but it is also different you can do the whole thing about a simple one 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.809
 Wacken Klix erase her 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.859
 these leaks click on it 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.429
 he delivers if we want to delete the clipboard completely 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.599
 we say yes 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.009
 and our clipboard is completely empty 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.359
 and they did not want any more possibilities to insert something 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.400
 if we do not want to be allowed out of five bands all the time and who sticks 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.950
 the one want to give it is also very simple illegal from the link 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.619
 on on the desktop 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:01.809
 first we have to copy and that min the room rate he to Command 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:06.109
 with that looks like say then act is save as 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.649
 if the clipboard empty does not work so there must be something 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:09.579
 be inside 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.159
 Save as 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.159
 and then someone desktop out and say a few times 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.599
 Klindworth 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.629
 to save 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.059
 and I have that up here 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.949
 my a camp lives there 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.409
 that they decide 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.469
 and i copied it to a rtf document too i just show it 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.049
 really on it 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.159
 then she is automatically asked if he is the whole of Chen so of childhood 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.289
 People want to say yes 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
 without the clipboard 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.649
 a very nice feature as I said in the minus XP is the whole 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.689
 internally 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.480
 and im - vista and 7 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.099
 there is no longer in the form 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.319
 and come to your own video 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.499
 The Wars is only one of the sex offenders to ask questions the ways are known 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.529
 Email the forum or YouTube news
