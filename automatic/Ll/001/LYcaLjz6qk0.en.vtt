00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.690
 Now I'm going to convert these potatoes and 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.840
 back to the microwave for the remainder of the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.840
 team 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 while the potatoes are passing the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.900
 rest of the time that I 'm going to do 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.319
