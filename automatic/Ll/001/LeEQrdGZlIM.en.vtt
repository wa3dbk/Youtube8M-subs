00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
the game for quite a while had the

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.670 
the game for quite a while had the
summer<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.850> deal<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:05.320> had<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> lot<00:02:05.619> of

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
summer to deal with so I had a lot of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.469 
summer to deal with so I had a lot of
things<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.100> think<00:02:06.700> about<00:02:06.850> when<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.180> was<00:02:07.299> in<00:02:07.390> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
things to think about when I was in the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.540 
things to think about when I was in the
ring<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.950> sometimes<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.160> could<00:02:09.250> lose<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.429> bit

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
ring and sometimes you could lose a bit

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.340 
ring and sometimes you could lose a bit
of<00:02:09.610> focus<00:02:09.819> so<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.270> was<00:02:10.390> quite<00:02:10.569> hard<00:02:10.690> mentally

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
of focus so it was quite hard mentally

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.330 
of focus so it was quite hard mentally
it<00:02:11.590> was<00:02:11.709> my<00:02:11.830> hardest<00:02:12.190> fight<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:15.190> was

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
it was my hardest fight but it was

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.790 
it was my hardest fight but it was
fantastic<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:15.850> my<00:02:16.030> my<00:02:16.450> experience<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.709> know

starts<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.170> drop<00:02:54.410> through<00:02:54.770> that<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.130> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
starts to drop through that you know the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.060 
starts to drop through that you know the
mid<00:02:55.490> mid<00:02:55.880> fight<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.440> that<00:02:57.770> was<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.980> only

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
mid mid fight so that was the only

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.700 
mid mid fight so that was the only
difference<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.540> obviously<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.170> get<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.530> see

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
difference and obviously you get to see

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.520 
difference and obviously you get to see
the<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:02.120> card<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.720> go<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> couple<00:03:03.110> more<00:03:03.350> times

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530
