00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.190
 question number 17 once again arriving 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.410
 to your house under tremendous downpour after 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.190
 of having walked like crazy under the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.350
 rain and you're wet until the ring 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.520
 matrix 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.240
 and they ask you 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.420
 [Music] 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.420
 do not 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.180
 it's not like they 're going to build me clothes 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.860
 question number 18 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.540
 you are clearly seeing that you are 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.260
 dying of cold and trembling of the cold if 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.260
 they ask you 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.799
 but the chaos 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.140
 number 19 are clearly on the ground 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.140
 because you just stumbled 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.430
 Question 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.240
 two 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.680
 this question if I'm going to explain it 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.680
 little because it's common 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.680
 something difficult you are approximately 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.950
 in your seven and nine months of pregnancy 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.520
 clearly your belly 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:04.180
 it's not scattered like this is 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.830
 literally 178 9 months you would have to 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.100
 be from another planet to do this 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.100
 Question 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:17.970
 and the tipales that measure stuck in 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.970
 food so as not to eat in nine months 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:26.620
 and finally this question a lot 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.700
 people approximately every fifteen 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.270
 seconds around the world 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.290
 we ask her this question is a few times 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.330
 that does not have a mother does not cause laughter 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:44.220
 Annoyed and angry are those pinches 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:48.230
 questions that piss off and that typical 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.230
 question is which 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.979
 in which 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.819
 s 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.819
 [Applause] 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.699
 at this time 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.190
 where when you receive a 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.680
 question of this kind do not answer it 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.990
 because they are doing a 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.830
 question including other questions in 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.410
 instead of directly arriving and telling them 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.970
 sorry the question is do not ask you 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.289
 asking you if you can do 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.530
 another question in which I was already 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.990
 making you spend spit on cancer you the 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.389
 question then at this time is 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.280
 when he had the test you say you know that 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.280
 go all many days 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.100
 if you go to a question to ask 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.990
 for the questions then also products 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:46.750
 a question 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.750
 Let's see 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.360
 we talked 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.740
 [Music] 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.740
