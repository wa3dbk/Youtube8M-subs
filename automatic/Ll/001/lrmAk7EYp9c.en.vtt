00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.300
 now we will see a part of the 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.210
 pharmacokinetics which is the volume of 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.150
 distribution of a drug definition 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.200
 says that volume of distribution is the 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.689
 calculated and apparent dissolution notice 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.490
 that is apparent from a drug in the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.869
 body 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.140
 and this is born from the fact that the drugs 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.290
 distribute in different ways according to 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 each molecule 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.590
 let's see this exercise 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.320
 if we have a container with a volume 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.660
 of unknown water and to this container 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.930
 we are going to add 10 milligrams of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.980
 sodium chloride or salt 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.090
 notice we do not know what volume there is but 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.820
 if we know that we are administering 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.150
 10 milligrams we then measure the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.380
 concentration in the liquid and the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.770
 result 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.980
 once obviously throwing the mixture is 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.430
 point 1 milligrams per milliliter 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.370
 so 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.690
 we see this formula that the volume of 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.750
 distribution is equal to the split dose 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.320
 the concentration we do not know the volume 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.420
 of the container but we know the dose that 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520
 they were 10 milligrams of salt and also 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.140
 we now know the concentration once 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 we could measure this in the liquid already with 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.380
 the 10 milligrams of salt and then 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.080
 we simply operate 10 / point 1 and we 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.620
 gives 100 milliliters then 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.659
 our liquid had a volume of 100 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.319
 milliliters 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.780
 starting from this we can do the 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.130
 calculations in the human body because 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.319
 we always know the dose that 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.920
 we manage logically and the 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.670
 we can measure the concentration in the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.409
 laboratory 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.700
 an important factor is knowing the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.030
 amount of fluid the body has 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.030
 human 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.369
 as we see here the human body has a 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.590
 total volume of 42 liters distributed 3 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.220
 in the plasma 11 in the volume 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.220
 interstitial or interstitial space and 28 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.650
 inside the total cells 42 liters 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.170
 this obviously varies depending on the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.800
 size and weight of a person and these 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.910
 numbers are approximate to an individual 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.910
 of 70 kilos 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.000
 very well then in this picture or in 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.540
 this graph we can see 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.270
 the different compartments and their 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.920
 different volumes in the human body 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.590
 and on the left we can see a video 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.470
 larger volume of distribution and a baby 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.360
 and a smaller volume of distribution 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:02.650
 so when we have volumes 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:05.230
 high distributions greater than 48 liters 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.239
 we have molecules that are in the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.510
 intravascular space in the interstitial 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.230
 intracellular and they even get to fat 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.629
 these are the drugs 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.209
 whose discussion volumes are very 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.909
 elevated on the other hand a volume of 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.970
 small distribution for example of three 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.930
 liters then we can infer that the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.120
 drug is only in space 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.000
 intravascular 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 let's see some examples this penalty has a 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.959
 distribution volume of 14 liters of 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.690
 fepime has a volume of distribution 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.650
 of 20 liters and levofloxacin has a 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.180
 Dissolution volume of 70 liters 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.700
 if we place these volumes 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.980
 distribution or rather these data in 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.920
 our previous chart 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.030
 We will see that this pending has a 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.430
 smaller dissolution volume not of 14 liters 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.020
 therefore he would only be in space 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.170
 interstitial intravascular 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.240
 while repressing has a volume 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.570
 of 20 so its penetration is 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.010
 major and levofloxacin has a volume 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.709
 of 70 diffusion what makes it have 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.830
 more volume than the body has 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.630
 human , hence the apparent word if 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.400
 remember because it's one of the volume of 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.600
 apparent diffusion 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.180
 and then he's giving us 70 liters this 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.200
 it means that it has been distributed 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.320
 also in the fatty tissue of the body 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.000
 and now that it influences the volume of 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.520
 distribution of a drug because it is 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.590
 greater in some drugs and less in others 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.720
 good thing is the size of the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.340
 very large molecule molecules can not 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.980
 spread as easily as 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.400
 small molecules another is the union to 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.200
 proteins that has a drug to older 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.210
 joints special protein albumin 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.220
 they will spread less and can not 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.190
 leave the intravascular space and 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.010
 it costs more to spread another is if the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.860
 Silico or hydrophilic slip drug 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.810
 lipophilic drugs or related to 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.729
 hardness tend to spread with 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.819
 greater ease 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.809
 what is involved in the volume of distribution 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.419
 when we have volume of distribution 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:22.389
 high there is more distribution in the 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.659
 body includes in lipids there is greater 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.150
 penetration to tissues and also influences 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:31.520
 in the half-life of the drug so 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.199
 directly proportional 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.340
 when we see the relationship between volume 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:39.229
 of drug distribution and half-life 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.409
 let's go back to the drug example 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.699
 previous test in 14 liters and we see 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.550
 a measured life of 4 hours 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.199
 efe pm has 20 liters of volume of 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.409
 dissolution and has a half life of two 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:54.009
 hours leo fluoxetine 70 liters has a 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.319
 7- hour average life and azithromycin 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.319
 It has a huge volume of distribution 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.750
 of 31 liters per kilogram and has a 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.979
 mean life of 68 hours therefore 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.500
 we can see that in almost all of these 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.540
 drugs relates to greater volume of 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.270
 distribution greater average life 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.840
 the exception is between the first two 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.100
 this grief and cepyme where this grief to 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.780
 Although it has a volume of 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.690
 smaller distribution has more half life 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.660
 but here comes the next factor in 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.580
 the half-life that is the purification of 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.889
 drug 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.500
 The greater the clearance of the drug, the less 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.170
 half life 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.540
 and greater volume of distribution of 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.460
 median higher life drug then these 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:44.810
 two factors are very important 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:47.810
 and they are the ones that mark the average life of a 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:50.419
 medicine in the human body for 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.610
 finish with this I invite you to do the 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.090
 next exercise 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.090
 until next time
