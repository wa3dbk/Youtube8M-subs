00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
lowered the gain on my mic a lot so

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
lowered the gain on my mic a lot so
hopefully<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.190> ritz<00:00:41.399> deb<00:00:41.790> back<00:00:41.940> gets<00:00:42.180> get

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
hopefully it get ritz deb back gets get

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
hopefully it get ritz deb back gets get
rids<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.440> background<00:00:43.680> noise<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
rids of this background noise and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
rids of this background noise and
hopefully<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.300> voice<00:00:45.570> audio<00:00:45.780> isn't<00:00:46.020> too<00:00:46.200> low

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
hopefully the voice audio isn't too low

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.190

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
objective game modes in general that are

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
objective game modes in general that are
give<00:00:54.239> me<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> black<00:00:54.570> ops<00:00:54.780> 2<00:00:54.899> now<00:00:55.280> I'm<00:00:56.280> sure<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
give me in black ops 2 now I'm sure you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
give me in black ops 2 now I'm sure you
all<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.000> guys<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.539> by<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.800> about<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> new

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
all you guys all know by now about a new

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.880 
all you guys all know by now about a new
point<00:00:59.219> streak<00:00:59.489> system<00:00:59.879> basically<00:01:00.890> everything

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
point streak system basically everything

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
point streak system basically everything
you<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.340> counts<00:01:02.910> towards<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.300> streak<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you do now counts towards your streak so

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.620 
you do now counts towards your streak so
say<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.589> assist<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> got<00:01:05.220> 50<00:01:05.460> points

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
say you can assist you got 50 points

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.910 
say you can assist you got 50 points
that<00:01:06.630> counts<00:01:07.020> towards<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.380> kill<00:01:07.500> streak<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that counts towards your kill streak and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250 
that counts towards your kill streak and
I<00:01:07.979> think<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.460> cool<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.299> don't

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
I think that's really cool and I don't

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
I think that's really cool and I don't
want<00:01:10.380> okay<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.369> sort<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> thinking<00:01:12.030> about

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
want okay I was sort of thinking about

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
want okay I was sort of thinking about
it<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> few<00:01:12.570> days<00:01:12.750> ago<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.920> kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> popped

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it a few days ago and it kind of popped

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
it a few days ago and it kind of popped
in<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.670> mind<00:01:15.020> how<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> affect

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in my mind how is this going to affect

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.980 
in my mind how is this going to affect
objective<00:01:17.549> game<00:01:17.729> modes<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.630> thought

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
objective game modes because I thought

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.870 
objective game modes because I thought
about<00:01:19.170> search<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.619> destroy<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.340> 500

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
about search and destroy you get 500

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570 
about search and destroy you get 500
points<00:01:21.000> per<00:01:21.299> kill<00:01:22.250> obviously<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.490> not

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
points per kill obviously you're not

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
points per kill obviously you're not
going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:23.909> 500<00:01:24.509> points<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:25.350> Search<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
going to get 500 points in Search and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
going to get 500 points in Search and
Destroy<00:01:25.890> towards<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.820> kill<00:01:27.000> streak<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> I'll

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
Destroy towards your kill streak is I'll

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
Destroy towards your kill streak is I'll
be<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:27.990> dumb<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.729> three<00:01:29.729> kills<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
be really dumb because three kills you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
be really dumb because three kills you
have<00:01:30.390> 1500<00:01:30.900> points<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.320> pick<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.829> have

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
have 1500 points you pick you have

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.620 
have 1500 points you pick you have
attack<00:01:32.220> dogs<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.210> gonna<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.509> really

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
attack dogs then that's gonna be really

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
attack dogs then that's gonna be really
dumb<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.189> I'm<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> curious<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.759> see<00:01:35.880> what

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
dumb so I'm kind of curious to see what

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
dumb so I'm kind of curious to see what
they're<00:01:36.150> gonna<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.259> they<00:01:37.409> going

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
they're gonna do like how are they going

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.499 
they're gonna do like how are they going
to<00:01:37.619> change<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> points<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.390> an

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to change the points you get in an

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
to change the points you get in an
objective<00:01:39.630> game<00:01:40.049> modes<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.770> feel<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
objective game modes and I feel that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.940 
objective game modes and I feel that
this<00:01:41.820> will<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.409> really<00:01:43.409> change

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this will really really change

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.580 
this will really really change
domination<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.970> general<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.590> there's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
domination in general because there's

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.719 
domination in general because there's
three<00:01:46.770> types<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.070> people<00:01:47.399> who<00:01:47.549> play

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
three types of people who play

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
three types of people who play
domination<00:01:48.149> ok<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
domination ok there's the you know the

can like I a good game for me in
domination<00:02:20.550> 6<00:02:20.970> p-6<00:02:21.300> would<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.660> no<00:02:22.110> sixty<00:02:22.560> and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
domination 6 p-6 would be no sixty and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.300 
domination 6 p-6 would be no sixty and
five<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:23.430> five<00:02:24.380> six<00:02:25.380> fly<00:02:25.620> caps<00:02:25.920> that'll<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
five with five six fly caps that'll be a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.490 
five with five six fly caps that'll be a
good<00:02:26.490> game<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.760> me<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.170> these<00:02:28.170> are<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
good game for me and these are the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.260 
good game for me and these are the
people<00:02:28.770> who<00:02:28.800> play<00:02:29.100> domination<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.000> think

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
people who play domination and I think

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.300 
people who play domination and I think
that<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:31.020> impact<00:02:31.680> two<00:02:32.070> types

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
that this will really impact two types

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.060 
that this will really impact two types
people<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.630> people<00:02:33.810> who<00:02:34.140> spawn<00:02:34.440> trap<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
people the people who spawn trap and the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.940 
people the people who spawn trap and the
people<00:02:35.460> who<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:36.150> play<00:02:36.360> casually<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.170> let<00:02:37.890> me

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
people who just play casually so let me

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.760 
people who just play casually so let me
explain<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.790> get<00:02:38.910> dogs<00:02:39.210> in<00:02:39.630> black<00:02:40.320> ops<00:02:40.530> you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
explain you get dogs in black ops you

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.360 
explain you get dogs in black ops you
needed<00:02:41.100> 11<00:02:41.850> kills<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.510> black<00:02:43.350> ops<00:02:43.560> 2<00:02:43.740> 11<00:02:44.160> kills

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
needed 11 kills so black ops 2 11 kills

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.050 
needed 11 kills so black ops 2 11 kills
is<00:02:44.580> 550<00:02:45.450> points<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.990> dogs<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.100> think

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
is 550 points and dogs are I think

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.510 
is 550 points and dogs are I think
that's<00:02:48.180> well<00:02:48.450> 50<00:02:49.050> scorestreak<00:02:49.950> I'm<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.340> too

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
that's well 50 scorestreak I'm not too

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.500 
that's well 50 scorestreak I'm not too
sure<00:02:50.700> don't<00:02:50.880> quote<00:02:51.000> me<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.240> but<00:02:51.390> i'm

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
sure don't quote me on that but i'm

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.050 
sure don't quote me on that but i'm
pretty<00:02:51.660> sure<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:51.960> 1200<00:02:52.500> something<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.070> i<00:02:53.310> did

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
pretty sure it's 1200 something so i did

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780 
pretty sure it's 1200 something so i did
the<00:02:54.150> math<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.930> basically<00:02:55.140> need<00:02:55.580> 11<00:02:56.580> kills

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the math you basically need 11 kills

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.990 
the math you basically need 11 kills
along<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.720> four<00:02:58.050> fly<00:02:58.350> caps<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.040> three

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
along with four fly caps and three

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.450 
along with four fly caps and three
offensive<00:03:00.690> or<00:03:00.900> defensive<00:03:00.930> kills<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.040> i<00:03:02.100> think

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
offensive or defensive kills and i think

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.080 
offensive or defensive kills and i think
that<00:03:03.860> what<00:03:04.860> this<00:03:04.980> means<00:03:05.160> basically<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:06.030> you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
that what this means basically is if you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.130 
that what this means basically is if you
don't<00:03:06.240> play<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> objective<00:03:06.840> you're<00:03:07.050> not

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
don't play the objective you're not

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.090 
don't play the objective you're not
getting<00:03:07.410> dogs<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.250> straight<00:03:08.640> up<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.230> i<00:03:10.230> feel

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
getting dogs and straight up and i feel

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.980 
getting dogs and straight up and i feel
that<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.460> Blackbird<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.120> going<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.360> be<00:03:12.450> really

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
that the Blackbird is going to be really

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.300 
that the Blackbird is going to be really
really<00:03:13.530> popular<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.340> black<00:03:14.640> ops<00:03:14.820> 2<00:03:14.970> because<00:03:15.360> I

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
really popular in black ops 2 because I

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.000 
really popular in black ops 2 because I
mean<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:18.420> takes<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.080> many<00:03:19.260> points<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.860> get

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
mean just it takes so many points to get

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.590 
mean just it takes so many points to get
these<00:03:20.160> high<00:03:20.370> killstreaks<00:03:20.640> now<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.570> feel

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
these high killstreaks now and I feel

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.620 
these high killstreaks now and I feel
that<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.260> will<00:03:22.470> really<00:03:22.890> ruin<00:03:23.400> black<00:03:23.940> ops<00:03:24.180> 2<00:03:24.420> for

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
that it will really ruin black ops 2 for

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.880 
that it will really ruin black ops 2 for
these<00:03:24.720> people<00:03:25.050> with<00:03:25.140> spawn<00:03:25.380> trap<00:03:25.620> all<00:03:25.800> the

streak<00:03:43.500> system<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.070> bit<00:03:44.250> too<00:03:44.610> biased

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
streak system is a bit too biased

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.199 
streak system is a bit too biased
towards<00:03:46.140> one<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:47.340> know<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:47.610> style<00:03:48.060> of

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
towards one you know like style of

towards one you know like style of
player<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.450> think<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.140> black<00:03:49.350> ops<00:03:49.590> 2<00:03:49.800> is

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
player I think that black ops 2 is

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.820 
player I think that black ops 2 is
catering<00:03:50.400> too<00:03:50.700> much<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.830> competitive

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
catering too much to the competitive

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.500 
catering too much to the competitive
type<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.490> people<00:03:53.790> because<00:03:53.910> modern<00:03:54.180> warfare<00:03:54.360> 3

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
like black ops 2 is going to be boring

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.050 
like black ops 2 is going to be boring
for<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.560> lot<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:19.890> people<00:04:20.130> who<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.520> play<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
for a lot of people who just play a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.580 
for a lot of people who just play a
certain<00:04:21.330> style<00:04:21.720> you<00:04:22.080> know<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.350> spawn

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
certain style you know the spawn

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.780 
certain style you know the spawn
trapping<00:04:22.890> people<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.610> I<00:04:24.860> mean<00:04:25.860> we'll<00:04:26.550> have<00:04:26.700> to

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
trapping people and I mean we'll have to

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.290 
trapping people and I mean we'll have to
see

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
see

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.330 
see
maybe<00:04:27.560> killstreaks<00:04:28.560> will<00:04:28.740> stack<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.220> each

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
maybe killstreaks will stack to each

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.909 
maybe killstreaks will stack to each
other<00:04:29.520> because<00:04:29.759> I<00:04:29.849> saw<00:04:30.199> like<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.379> get<00:04:31.560> assists

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
other because I saw like you get assists

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.680 
other because I saw like you get assists
for<00:04:32.069> uavs<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.819> get<00:04:32.970> assists<00:04:33.240> for<00:04:33.449> pretty<00:04:33.629> much

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
for uavs you get assists for pretty much

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.779 
for uavs you get assists for pretty much
everything<00:04:34.080> now<00:04:34.379> so<00:04:34.680> maybe<00:04:34.919> this<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.430> all<00:04:35.550> just

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
everything now so maybe this is all just

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.119 
everything now so maybe this is all just
pointless<00:04:36.569> talk<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.110> he<00:04:37.289> you'll<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:37.919> able<00:04:37.979> to

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
pointless talk and he you'll be able to

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.529 
pointless talk and he you'll be able to
get<00:04:38.220> your<00:04:38.340> killstreaks<00:04:38.759> no<00:04:38.909> problem<00:04:39.270> but<00:04:39.389> I'm

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
get your killstreaks no problem but I'm

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:40.790 
get your killstreaks no problem but I'm
just<00:04:39.720> something<00:04:40.110> interesting<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.620> thought

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
just something interesting I thought

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.760 
just something interesting I thought
about<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:42.360> i<00:04:42.750> think<00:04:43.349> the<00:04:43.409> highest

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
about because i think the highest

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.610 
about because i think the highest
killstreak<00:04:44.039> is<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.539> 1400<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.810> swarm<00:04:46.349> with<00:04:46.590> a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
killstreak is like 1400 the swarm with a

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.790 
killstreak is like 1400 the swarm with a
little<00:04:46.860> paper<00:04:47.190> airplane<00:04:47.669> drones<00:04:48.060> you<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.389> I

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
little paper airplane drones you know I

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.589 
little paper airplane drones you know I
mean<00:04:49.800> 1400<00:04:50.520> /<00:04:50.789> 50<00:04:51.210> that's<00:04:51.419> like<00:04:53.419> 1450<00:04:54.419> that's

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
mean 1400 / 50 that's like 1450 that's

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.300 
mean 1400 / 50 that's like 1450 that's
like<00:04:54.690> 35<00:04:55.229> killed<00:04:55.530> or<00:04:55.710> something<00:04:56.009> okay<00:04:56.190> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
like 35 killed or something okay the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.950 
like 35 killed or something okay the
math<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.610> really<00:04:56.759> wrong<00:04:57.000> but<00:04:57.060> something

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
math is really wrong but something

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.159 
math is really wrong but something
around<00:04:58.110> 30<00:04:58.440> kills<00:04:58.800> that's<00:04:59.129> how<00:04:59.280> that's<00:04:59.520> insane

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
around 30 kills that's how that's insane

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.020 
around 30 kills that's how that's insane
and<00:05:01.169> this<00:05:01.379> won't<00:05:01.560> affect<00:05:01.590> TDM<00:05:02.190> at<00:05:02.370> all<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:02.789> for

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
and this won't affect TDM at all but for

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.189 
and this won't affect TDM at all but for
the<00:05:03.090> objective<00:05:03.449> game<00:05:03.629> modes<00:05:03.659> it's<00:05:04.020> going<00:05:04.139> to

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
the objective game modes it's going to

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.459 
the objective game modes it's going to
change<00:05:04.259> black<00:05:04.830> ops<00:05:05.099> a<00:05:05.250> lot<00:05:05.639> so<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:07.169> I<00:05:07.289> thought

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
change black ops a lot so and I thought

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.170 
change black ops a lot so and I thought
it<00:05:07.530> was<00:05:07.590> an<00:05:07.710> interesting<00:05:07.800> discussion<00:05:08.639> like<00:05:08.969> an

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180

it was an interesting discussion like an
interesting<00:05:09.539> sort<00:05:09.690> of<00:05:09.810> thing<00:05:10.199> to<00:05:10.349> talk<00:05:10.469> about
