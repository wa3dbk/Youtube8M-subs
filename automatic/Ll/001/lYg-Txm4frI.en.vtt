these<00:00:00.599> green<00:00:01.079> light<00:00:01.620> green<00:00:01.829> bombs<00:00:02.220> are<00:00:02.760> the

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
these green light green bombs are the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.369 
these green light green bombs are the
maxilla<00:00:03.770> the<00:00:04.770> maxilla<00:00:05.279> forms<00:00:06.350> the<00:00:07.350> anterior

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
maxilla the maxilla forms the anterior

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.940 
maxilla the maxilla forms the anterior
part<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.280> face<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> lot<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.950> you

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
part of the face a lot of it and you

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.589 
part of the face a lot of it and you
know<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.460> you're<00:00:11.790> talking<00:00:12.150> about<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
know that you're talking about the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.440 
know that you're talking about the
maxilla<00:00:13.200> when<00:00:14.009> you're<00:00:14.639> talking<00:00:15.059> about<00:00:15.179> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
maxilla when you're talking about the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.700 
maxilla when you're talking about the
bomb<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.980> upper<00:00:17.460> teeth<00:00:17.970> are

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
bomb in which the upper teeth are

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.349 
bomb in which the upper teeth are
embedded<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.310> here<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.640> upper<00:00:20.910> teeth<00:00:21.119> are

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
embedded so here the upper teeth are

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.920 
embedded so here the upper teeth are
this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> Mac<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.529> there's<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.480> left<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.810> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
this is the Mac so there's a left and a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.650 
this is the Mac so there's a left and a
right<00:00:24.980> maxilla<00:00:26.210> there<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> couple<00:00:27.480> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
right maxilla there are a couple of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.240 
right maxilla there are a couple of
regions<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> Mac<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.859> you're

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
regions on the Mac so that you're

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.070 
regions on the Mac so that you're
responsible<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> frontal

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
responsible for there is the frontal

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
responsible for there is the frontal
process<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.949> frontal<00:00:32.340> process<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.059> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
process the frontal process is this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.139 
process the frontal process is this
anterior<00:00:33.960> part<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.370> palatine

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
anterior part there is a palatine

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.170 
anterior part there is a palatine
process<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.350> palatine<00:00:37.920> process<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> part

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
process the palatine process is the part

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.000 
process the palatine process is the part
of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> frontal<00:00:39.809> bone<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.290> forms<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of the frontal bone that forms the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.049 
of the frontal bone that forms the
palate<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.210> hard<00:00:42.480> palate<00:00:42.920> there<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.640> hole

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
palate the hard palate there is a hole

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
palate the hard palate there is a hole
in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.760> maxilla<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.780> hole<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.410> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
in the maxilla and it's a hole that is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.490 
in the maxilla and it's a hole that is
found<00:00:49.800> inferior<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> orbit<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.960> cleverly

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
found inferior to the orbit so cleverly

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.270 
found inferior to the orbit so cleverly
it<00:00:52.890> has<00:00:53.070> been<00:00:53.250> named<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> infraorbital

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
it has been named the infraorbital

foramen inferior to the orbital you're

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
foramen inferior to the orbital you're
responsible<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> alveoli<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
responsible to know the alveoli the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.670 
responsible to know the alveoli the
alveoli<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> sockets<00:01:04.470> in

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
alveoli are actually the sockets in

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.850 
alveoli are actually the sockets in
which<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:05.129> teeth<00:01:05.489> sit<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.840> socket<00:01:07.409> now

the upper jaw and they are stuck in

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.219 
the upper jaw and they are stuck in
little<00:01:50.070> alveoli<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> an<00:01:51.329> alveolus<00:01:51.750> this

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
little alveoli this is an alveolus this

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
little alveoli this is an alveolus this
is<00:01:52.380> an<00:01:52.530> alveolus<00:01:53.090> these<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> alveoli

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
is an alveolus these are the alveoli

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.730 
is an alveolus these are the alveoli
that<00:01:55.909> which<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.180> Tecla<00:01:57.390> tooth<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.170> stickier

that which the Tecla tooth is stickier

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.080 
that which the Tecla tooth is stickier
you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.280> taste<00:01:59.490> about<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.850> come<00:01:59.969> out

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you can see that taste about to come out

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.690 
you can see that taste about to come out
here's<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.020> palatine<00:02:01.530> process<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
here's the palatine process of the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.870 
here's the palatine process of the
maxilla<00:02:03.270> here's<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.590> frontal<00:02:05.130> process<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
maxilla here's the frontal process and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.249 
maxilla here's the frontal process and
here<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.540> neutral<00:02:06.719> orbital<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.770> Eamonn

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
here is that neutral orbital or Eamonn

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.100 
here is that neutral orbital or Eamonn
next<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.129> palatine<00:02:11.970> bomb<00:02:12.239> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
next we have the palatine bomb this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.350 
next we have the palatine bomb this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
here then you have two other bones this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.660 
here then you have two other bones this
is<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.390> Palatine<00:02:28.110> bone<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.800> here<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.550> the
