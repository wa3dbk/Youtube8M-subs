00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 hello addressed the owner of the car 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:17.119
 volkswagen toureg need 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.949
 control modes of opportunity 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.920
 implement necessarily passive mode 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.970
 security that is immobilizer mode and 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.560
 realize the possibility of remote 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.439
 lock buddy even can not be 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640
 located 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 considering the features of this car 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 and all customer wishes you set on 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.989
 car pontoon system model 39 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 Now we will talk about how it works 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.789
 the main function of this system is that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.480
 is the system she 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.370
 controlled with tilt when performing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.899
 each team again in the hatch of the car 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.520
 re-authorization occurs 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.260
 the owner of the help is so accurate 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.030
 which should always be coming without 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 such tags start moving on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.370
 car as well as it will continue even 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 if the engine was started impossible 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.200
 Now we turn on the protection of grain 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 film when setting tricks lights up 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.170
 central care staff security 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.119
 system 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.350
 it's the next job here this 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 LEDs kind of like function 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.740
 is different 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.350
 tightening of glasses and in the mode of protection of the system 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.619
 control the perimeter guard the hood and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.619
 until 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:57.569
 If there is any doubt about their treatment 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:59.429
 decides also authorization will extract from 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.200
 two batteries and death 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.640
 a few of the most simulate the situation 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.550
 that the owner is not in his car 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.200
 nearby 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.460
 and we only have one village picture 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.460
 here we are 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.180
 assessment system closed in the absence of 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.220
 label by clicking on the button on the bearing in 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.960
 one keychain 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.970
 we can get salon the system has 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.970
 more girl on the inclusion here it is 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:08.270
 This case disable the protection mode 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:08.270
 can any phone be turned off too i can 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.440
 Now we will show how the management works. 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.700
 service security features for 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.879
 This alarm heard a call from 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.349
 phone 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.030
 not a registered system, that is now 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:33.349
 the system makes the call the owner number 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:37.750
 so she is now we are leaving the number 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.750
 phones and attributed? 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.580
 we enter the password and automatically 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.950
 we access voice system and 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.150
 votes in the system mode tells 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.840
 us about the events that occurred 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.840
 for the current period 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.230
 from a mobile phone we can manage 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.879
 voice guards are also exactly as summary 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.940
 warmer for example we can system with the phrase 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:10.040
 we can system on the page immediately 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.050
 Now we will simulate a situation when 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.080
 the owner put the car on farm car 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.630
 systems and from car hit you 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.610
 remove the battery there is nothing tattoo 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.950
 closer we can activate the function 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:29.350
 remote start 2 now we have it 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:32.660
 case enter the code to someone at the exit of the year 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.849
 system us voice mode after the fact 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.779
 cleaning operation 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.779
 call as we see 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.040
 work out the time we fall for 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.040
 traditionally the truth 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.590
 what with 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.120
 here 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.390
 gold now the system is in 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.390
 flange 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.950
 inclusion itself happens 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.300
 sound alert about 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.900
 these three 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.900
 naturally 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.980
 because how 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.180
 goes back to 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.300
 soft landing in this case therefore 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.300
 all 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.360
 I will install the dosing battery 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.860
 he seemed number battery tag system 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.240
 immediately determine its presence 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.240
 and now we will hear 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.449
 when approaching the car site of the agent as 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.639
 you heard can 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.550
 hear the beep he tells us 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.560
 that the security mode is off 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.320
 for something 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.060
 car owner coming up with this tag 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.820
 which is in the documents I have not 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.110
 gets up to stand on a budget 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.020
 I'm around the actor on the roof 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.729
 gets 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.199
 the result is removed from the security system 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.910
 Comes about what he went to 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.590
 cars will start driving at 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.440
 this he appears the master may 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.979
 both keys at once central locking 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.979
 cars 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.550
 for the beginning of the movement is enough to make 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.800
 the traditional thing as he always does 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.800
 insert the key into the ignition press 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.990
 on the pedal of words and keep on moving 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.970
 the end of the movement of the engine to improve 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.910
 in standard mode when pulling out 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:30.720
 key it back blocks 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:32.070
 going again I want to repeat that on 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.380
 This car we installed in 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.790
 system pandora 3910 which us 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.430
 allowed firstly by their flexible 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.330
 channels to implement the work of staff 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.630
 ignition switch 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:47.940
 we realized you can thank you were there 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.510
 weld control central lock 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.130
 weak shoulder and remotely running 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:56.420
 as always cars are ready and waiting 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.420
 bye thank you for your attention
