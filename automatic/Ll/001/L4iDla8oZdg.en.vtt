00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.050 

okay<00:01:09.340> link<00:01:09.550> below<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:10.210> realize<00:01:11.050> that<00:01:11.080> we<00:01:12.060> had

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
okay link below you realize that we had

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.250 
okay link below you realize that we had
our<00:01:13.210> issues<00:01:13.390> with<00:01:13.840> dog<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.190> it's<00:01:15.430> very<00:01:15.580> simple

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
our issues with dog so it's very simple

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.340 
our issues with dog so it's very simple
comes<00:01:17.260> out<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.590> box<00:01:17.770> nicely<00:01:18.400> basically<00:01:19.360> it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
comes out of a box nicely basically it

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.580 
comes out of a box nicely basically it
just<00:01:20.560> goes<00:01:20.770> like<00:01:20.890> this<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.810> think<00:01:26.170> it's<00:01:26.320> pretty

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
just goes like this I think it's pretty

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.730 
just goes like this I think it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:28.900> find<00:01:29.260> any<00:01:29.440> weird

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
self-explanatory if I find any weird

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.480 
self-explanatory if I find any weird
stuff<00:01:29.830> I'll<00:01:30.400> make<00:01:30.670> another<00:01:30.940> video<00:01:31.150> but<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
stuff I'll make another video but you

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.870 
stuff I'll make another video but you
know<00:01:33.580> needs<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.060> 9-volt<00:01:34.540> battery<00:01:35.310> which<00:01:36.310> we

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
know needs a 9-volt battery which we

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.340 
know needs a 9-volt battery which we
didn't<00:01:37.119> get<00:01:37.240> unfortunately<00:01:37.900> I'm<00:01:37.990> gonna<00:01:38.170> go

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
didn't get unfortunately I'm gonna go

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.810 
didn't get unfortunately I'm gonna go
and<00:01:38.560> pick<00:01:38.890> one<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.160> those<00:01:39.220> up<00:01:39.400> today<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.840> off

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and pick one of those up today on off

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.760 
and pick one of those up today on off
it's<00:01:42.820> got<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.119> alarm<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.259> guess<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:44.590> gives

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
it's got the alarm and I guess it gives

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.790 
it's got the alarm and I guess it gives
him<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.979> roll<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:46.119> jolt<00:01:46.540> now<00:01:46.960> luckily<00:01:47.259> for<00:01:47.619> him

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
him a roll the jolt now luckily for him

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.120 
him a roll the jolt now luckily for him
although<00:01:48.040> he<00:01:48.190> is<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.430> big<00:01:48.729> aggressive<00:01:49.560> dog<00:01:50.560> he's

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
although he is a big aggressive dog he's

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.980 
although he is a big aggressive dog he's
also<00:01:51.340> afraid<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.910> his<00:01:52.030> own<00:01:52.119> shadow<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.630> know<00:01:52.810> it

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
also afraid of his own shadow I know it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.650 
also afraid of his own shadow I know it
doesn't<00:01:53.170> make<00:01:53.320> any<00:01:53.560> sense<00:01:53.830> but<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:55.270> hoping

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
doesn't make any sense but I'm hoping

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.090 
doesn't make any sense but I'm hoping
that<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:55.960> will<00:01:56.170> do<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.440> trick<00:01:56.470> we've<00:01:56.860> been

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
that this will do the trick we've been

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.400 
that this will do the trick we've been
putting<00:01:59.040> folding<00:02:00.040> tables<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:01.290> sometimes<00:02:02.290> we

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
putting folding tables and sometimes we

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.080 
putting folding tables and sometimes we
put<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.710> vacuum<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> couch<00:02:03.550> because<00:02:03.940> he's

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
put the vacuum on the couch because he's

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.570 
put the vacuum on the couch because he's
definitely<00:02:04.330> afraid<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.899> vacuum<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:06.369> it's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
definitely afraid of the vacuum but it's

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.900 
definitely afraid of the vacuum but it's
just<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.850> nightmare<00:02:08.340> having<00:02:09.340> all<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.610> stuff

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
just a nightmare having all that stuff

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.100 
just a nightmare having all that stuff
to<00:02:10.030> deal<00:02:10.239> with<00:02:10.270> self<00:02:12.600> we're<00:02:13.600> gonna<00:02:13.750> give<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.080> to

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
to deal with self we're gonna give it to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.360 
to deal with self we're gonna give it to
sofas<00:02:14.560> graham<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:16.890> hopefully<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.220> will

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
sofas graham and hopefully this will

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
sofas graham and hopefully this will
work<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:20.830> assuming<00:02:21.640> I'm<00:02:21.880> gonna<00:02:22.000> have<00:02:22.239> some

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
work so I'm assuming I'm gonna have some

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.690 
work so I'm assuming I'm gonna have some
good<00:02:22.570> things<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.870> report<00:02:23.380> after<00:02:24.220> using<00:02:24.549> this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
good things to report after using this

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.310 
good things to report after using this
for<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> few<00:02:25.209> days<00:02:25.360> we'll<00:02:25.660> probably<00:02:25.930> start

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
for a few days we'll probably start

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.840 
for a few days we'll probably start
using<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.769> tonight<00:02:27.420> wish<00:02:28.420> me<00:02:28.660> luck
