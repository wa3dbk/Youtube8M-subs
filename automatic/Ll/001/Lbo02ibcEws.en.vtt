00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 greetings powers and energetic abilities 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.280
 gambit can load inanimate objects 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.170
 with internal energy, potential energy 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.469
 relative to the activity of molecules 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.120
 of an object giving them explosive power 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.609
 one of his characteristic tricks is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 throw letters being your favorite card 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.900
 the queen of hearts to her opponents 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 charging each letter with energy 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.070
 turning it into a deadly projectile and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.800
 saying the phrase my name is gambit 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.929
 remember it well other of his tricks have 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.399
 included energy charge rubber 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.320
 chew when he was 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.020
 completely tied and charged with energy 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 the floor of a whole room causing that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.550
 will explode with enormous force the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 Gambit's most powerful attack consists 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.379
 in charging power a full deck of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 a deck and throw it to your opponent the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.340
 energy released by the continuous 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.899
 explosion of the letters is so big 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.940
 that can harm even the most 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.100
 powerful marvel comics characters 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.410
 for example gladiator was left 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.719
 unconscious for this attack a 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.489
 most dangerous skill variant of this 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 power is that it can even do 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.659
 exploit people this was demonstrated in 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.899
 x-men evolution when 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.950
 Toad and charge it with kinetic energy 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.960
 threatening the brotherhood that would 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 explode the whole house of my tickets and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.969
 Gambit usually did not obey 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 I get an extendable cane formed by 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.319
 an adamantium alloy is 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.359
 highly trained in martial arts and 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.459
 has the physical attributes of a body 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.799
 has done to stay naturally in 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.420
 constant movement possibly a 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.819
 side effect of his powers 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.310
 mutants making him a super individual 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.439
 humanly acrobatic in numerous 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 has demonstrated the ability to 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.189
 convince people using hypnosis 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 light for which you must charge 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.179
 slightly of potential energy 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.549
 electric the individual's brain and 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.619
 seems to be able to avoid attempts to 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.569
 read your mind or psychically attack it 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.090
 due to the potential energy charge 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.009
 always present in your body is 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.200
 ability to convince could not 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.420
 be a result of hypnosis but that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.090
 it could be a power based on empathy 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.859
 it has been mentioned that this skill is 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.349
 becomes less effective when people 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.479
 is aware of its existence in its 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.220
 youth gambit had the ability to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.140
 control all forms of energy 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.300
 Kinetic power 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.060
 internal allowing any load 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.370
 thing in your visual field loading matter 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.440
 organic project bursts of energy 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.170
 defy gravity heal wounds 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.360
 imitate various types of energy and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.820
 cool objects by reducing their energy 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.920
 internal but the inability to control 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.840
 this caused him to resort to sinister 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 who extracted the portion of his tissue 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.640
 brain responsible for the manifestation 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.040
 total of his mutant powers after 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.050
 He returned with sinister as he 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 I found in Victorian England and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.610
 that portion of matter was reimplanted 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.860
 gray restoring his powers to one hundred 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.320
 cent until you consumed them after 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.570
 fighting with the new sun is unknown 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.430
 when sage reset his mutation this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.010
 could have been reverted to its level of 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.090
 original power as death the rider of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.709
 apocalypse 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 Gambit has shown the ability to 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.630
 convert inert objects into substances 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.540
 toxic for example could transform 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.360
 breathable air in poisonous gases 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.460
 skills 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.850

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.820
 drawer he also knows some Japanese no 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.350
 very fluent expert shooter he is very 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.660
 Skilful in throwing objects 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.670
 small as bola cards 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.280
 knives and balls with great precision 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.050
 master fighter but not in the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.910
 same level as the size of captain 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.160
 america he is still a fighter 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.700
 deep often employing arts 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.940
 martial street fighting and acrobatics 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:43.930

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.070
