00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 in the first half 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.540
 now 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 it's all obvious 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.370
 recall that 20 years ago 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.920
 Moscow 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 why 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 first channel 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.930
 there are no protocols like 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 broadcasts the Russian 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.410
 in response to that 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.950
 and the possible output is growing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.550
 in this market 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.550
 as for me so maybe not so much 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.910
 many months we need manzyuk new 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.540
 partner such numbers 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.540
 meanwhile in the committee 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.630
 in the first minutes 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.900
 besides 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.150
 here you need rubles 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.040
 I'd like to stay with it 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.570
 lots of 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.220
 it will not be easy 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 his example 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.760
 if we only buy a lot of power 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.740
 they can for free 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.940
 kosachev 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 his time in the absence but 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.650
 in this district 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.129
 the american 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.399
 besides the prime minister 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.809
 Ivanova if there is a result that we 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.809
 don't know if we stop in peace 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.799
 Besides 

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.189
 really unique 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 document posted on youtube 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.369
 he was never against a friend 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.319
 well yes 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.129
 to make 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.959
 half asleep not teams 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 he warned the clubs tape 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.239
 but later the question is whether 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:58.189
 in Crimea that is a hunch in 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.509
 welcome word 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:01.610
 First year 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.339
 probably the team 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.339
 today at 0 30 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:19.319
 let's think
