I'm going to strain it now because this

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.430 
I'm going to strain it now because this
juicer<00:01:03.340> ends<00:01:04.120> up<00:01:04.270> leaving<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.020> little<00:01:05.170> bit<00:01:05.350> of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
juicer ends up leaving a little bit of

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.840 
juicer ends up leaving a little bit of
pulp<00:01:05.650> in<00:01:05.830> there<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.220> I<00:01:06.280> like<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.640> have<00:01:06.760> my

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
strain it through a fine mesh strainer

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.500

and then what I like to do is I like to
run<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.080> pulp<00:01:14.320> through<00:01:14.560> one<00:01:14.860> more<00:01:15.040> time<00:01:15.310> with

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
run the pulp through one more time with

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.350 
run the pulp through one more time with
this<00:01:15.970> particular<00:01:16.360> juicer<00:01:16.930> it<00:01:17.080> kind<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.350> needs

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
this particular juicer it kind of needs

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.510 
this particular juicer it kind of needs
a<00:01:19.360> second<00:01:19.900> go<00:01:20.020> around<00:01:20.050> because<00:01:20.620> it<00:01:20.770> does<00:01:20.979> kind

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
a second go around because it does kind

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.800 
a second go around because it does kind
of<00:01:21.670> waste<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:22.180> lot<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.550> what<00:01:25.240> I<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.540> do

is just scoop it out into a bowl and the
juicer<00:01:30.040> comes<00:01:30.280> with<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.610> thing<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.210> the

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
juicer comes with this thing and the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.969 
juicer comes with this thing and the
handle<00:01:31.690> is<00:01:31.780> actually<00:01:31.930> perfect<00:01:32.560> for<00:01:32.800> getting

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
handle is actually perfect for getting

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.270 
handle is actually perfect for getting
the<00:01:33.280> pulp<00:01:33.520> out<00:01:33.759> of<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.970> rim<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.590> just<00:01:36.009> scoop

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
the pulp out of the rim so I just scoop

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.910 
the pulp out of the rim so I just scoop
it<00:01:36.430> into<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.820> bowl<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.869> then<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.110> form<00:01:38.619> it<00:01:38.740> into

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
it into a bowl and then I form it into

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.950 
it into a bowl and then I form it into
little<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.930> bowls<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> baseball<00:01:43.300> size

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
and then stick it back through just to

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.550 
and then stick it back through just to
get<00:01:47.290> any<00:01:47.619> extra<00:01:48.070> juice<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.780> would<00:01:50.229> have<00:01:50.380> been

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
get any extra juice that would have been

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.630 
get any extra juice that would have been
wasted

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.149 

it<00:01:59.540> gave<00:01:59.900> us<00:02:00.080> like<00:02:00.229> another<00:02:00.470> quarter<00:02:00.860> cup<00:02:01.040> of

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
it gave us like another quarter cup of

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.600 
it gave us like another quarter cup of
juice<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.470> let<00:02:03.470> all<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.740> pulp<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.340> and

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
juice so let all the pulp in here and

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.280 
juice so let all the pulp in here and
what<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.150> do<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.810> again<00:02:06.110> we're

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
what I like to do so that again we're

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.100 
what I like to do so that again we're
not<00:02:06.440> wasting<00:02:07.240> when<00:02:08.240> we're<00:02:08.390> straining<00:02:08.810> this

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
not wasting when we're straining this

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.199 
not wasting when we're straining this
most<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.100> liquid<00:02:10.459> will<00:02:10.640> fall<00:02:10.850> through<00:02:11.090> on

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
most of the liquid will fall through on

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.760 
most of the liquid will fall through on
its<00:02:11.360> own<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:11.900> there's<00:02:12.080> all<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.530> like

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
its own but then there's all this like

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.830 
its own but then there's all this like
foamy<00:02:13.190> stuff<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.700> makes<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.060> kind<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.600> clogs

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
foamy stuff that makes it kind of clogs

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.020 
foamy stuff that makes it kind of clogs
up<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.110> strainer<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.250> just<00:02:16.370> take<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.580> fork<00:02:16.820> or

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
up the strainer so I just take a fork or

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.600 
up the strainer so I just take a fork or
a<00:02:17.060> spoon<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.600> kind<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:18.050> churn<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.680> so

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
a spoon and kind of just churn it so

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.490 
a spoon and kind of just churn it so
then<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.880> opens<00:02:20.270> up<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.720> little<00:02:20.959> holes<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
then it opens up the little holes in the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.050 
then it opens up the little holes in the
mesh<00:02:21.650> strainer<00:02:21.950> for<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> juice<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.850> fall

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
mesh strainer for the juice to fall

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.990 
mesh strainer for the juice to fall
through<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.800> kind<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.830> unclog<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.459> from<00:02:25.880> all

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
through and kind of unclog it from all

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.430 
through and kind of unclog it from all
this<00:02:26.120> foam<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.660> what<00:02:26.780> will<00:02:26.930> happen<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.320> that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
this foam and what will happen is that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440 
this foam and what will happen is that
you'll<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.709> left<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.580> little<00:02:29.209> tiny

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
coconut sugar in a water solution and

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.199 
coconut sugar in a water solution and
you<00:03:13.070> let<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.370> ferment<00:03:13.579> for<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.970> day<00:03:14.090> or<00:03:14.150> two

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
you let that ferment for a day or two

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.390 
you let that ferment for a day or two
and<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.660> bubbles<00:03:14.930> up<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.530> turns<00:03:15.799> it<00:03:16.250> has

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
and it bubbles up and it turns it has

and it bubbles up and it turns it has
kind<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.640> like<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.820> kombucha<00:03:17.239> taste<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:18.620> so

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
kind of like a kombucha taste and so

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.199 
kind of like a kombucha taste and so
it's<00:03:18.950> probiotic<00:03:19.519> because<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.760> whole<00:03:19.940> point

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
I made and use that to dilute my juice a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.310 
I made and use that to dilute my juice a
little<00:03:25.700> bit<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.480> I'm<00:03:26.570> getting<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.959> some<00:03:27.170> good

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.410 
all good and I like diluting it
especially<00:03:40.220> because<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.610> helps<00:03:40.880> carry<00:03:41.180> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
especially because it helps carry the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.449 
especially because it helps carry the
juice<00:03:41.630> out<00:03:41.810> further<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.829> ensuring<00:03:43.310> that

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
juice out further and it's ensuring that

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.160 
juice out further and it's ensuring that
you're<00:03:43.579> getting<00:03:43.730> even<00:03:44.060> more<00:03:44.090> hydrated<00:03:44.989> and

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
you're getting even more hydrated and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.690 
you're getting even more hydrated and
especially<00:03:45.590> if<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.769> can<00:03:45.890> sneak<00:03:46.160> in<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:46.370> a

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
especially if you can sneak in like a

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.699 
especially if you can sneak in like a
probiotic<00:03:47.299> quality<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.079> it<00:03:48.200> that's<00:03:48.380> even

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
probiotic quality to it that's even

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.900 
probiotic quality to it that's even
better<00:03:48.890> you're<00:03:49.100> just<00:03:49.250> making<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:49.670> juice
