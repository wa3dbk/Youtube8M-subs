from<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.710> variety<00:00:20.220> bag<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:21.320> typically<00:00:22.320> advise

from a variety bag I typically advise

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.929 
from a variety bag I typically advise
against<00:00:22.980> these<00:00:23.220> because<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.490> don't<00:00:23.789> know

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
against these because you don't know

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.370 
against these because you don't know
what<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.420> gonna<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> what

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
what you're really gonna get it what

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.240 
what you're really gonna get it what
quality<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:27.119> kind<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> stuff

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
quality it's in that kind of stuff

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
quality it's in that kind of stuff
but<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.970> gotten<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
but what we have gotten here this is a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.740 
but what we have gotten here this is a
Torres<00:00:32.640> Shara<00:00:33.329> saya<00:00:33.630> katana<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:36.180> standard

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
Torres Shara saya katana it standard

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.459 
Torres Shara saya katana it standard
costs<00:00:37.140> $45<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.280> true<00:00:38.700> swords<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.469> after

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
costs $45 on true swords and after

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.799 
costs $45 on true swords and after
examination<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.850> seems<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.570> blade

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
examination it just seems like the blade

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.830 
examination it just seems like the blade
itself<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> bit<00:00:43.620> dirty<00:00:44.539> easy<00:00:45.539> enough<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
itself is a bit dirty easy enough to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.190 
itself is a bit dirty easy enough to
wipe<00:00:46.050> off<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.770> fine<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.870> think<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
wipe off and it's fine so I think that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.040 
wipe off and it's fine so I think that
was<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> great<00:00:49.800> deal<00:00:50.390> now<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> next<00:00:51.780> thing<00:00:51.899> we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
was a great deal now the next thing we

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.590 
was a great deal now the next thing we
got<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.489> killed<00:00:53.820> bill<00:00:54.030> replica

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
got here is they killed bill replica

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.439
