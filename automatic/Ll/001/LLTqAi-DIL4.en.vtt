this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.020> megasquirt<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.740> ECU<00:00:02.250> builds<00:00:02.970> on

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
this is the megasquirt to ECU builds on

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.059 
this is the megasquirt to ECU builds on
the<00:00:03.120> version<00:00:03.389> 3<00:00:03.720> motherboard<00:00:04.170> connected<00:00:04.859> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the mega stim version 2.2 and i'm going

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.249 
the mega stim version 2.2 and i'm going
to<00:00:09.660> show<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.110> functions<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.160> ECU<00:00:11.790> and

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
to show you the functions of the ECU and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.839 
to show you the functions of the ECU and

the ECU is currently being run off the
mega<00:00:19.500> stim<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:21.680> simulating<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
mega stim it's simulating all the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.790 
mega stim it's simulating all the
necessary<00:00:23.310> inputs<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.000> senses<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.480> an<00:00:24.630> engine

necessary inputs and senses of an engine

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.109 
necessary inputs and senses of an engine
it<00:00:25.800> basically<00:00:26.189> allows<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.820> mess<00:00:26.970> around

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it basically allows you to mess around

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
it basically allows you to mess around
with<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> ECU<00:00:28.140> before<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:28.949> gets

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
with the ECU before it actually gets

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.080 
with the ECU before it actually gets
installed<00:00:29.849> onto<00:00:30.179> an<00:00:30.390> engine<00:00:31.520> these<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
used to download all the various tables
and<00:00:56.879> options<00:00:57.180> you've<00:00:57.390> got<00:00:57.649> into<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> mega

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.610 
and options you've got into the mega
square<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.570> it<00:01:00.570> can<00:01:00.750> also<00:01:00.899> give<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
square and it can also give you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.090 
square and it can also give you
real-time<00:01:02.520> outputs<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.019> engine<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
real-time outputs from your engine or in

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.810 
real-time outputs from your engine or in
our<00:01:05.250> case<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.519> mega<00:01:05.880> stim<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.460> very

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
our case the mega stim and so if I very

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.840 
our case the mega stim and so if I very
the<00:01:09.060> RPM<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.280> see<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> left

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the RPM here you can see on the left

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
the RPM here you can see on the left
it's<00:01:12.090> directly<00:01:12.840> affecting<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> engine<00:01:13.590> speed

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it's directly affecting the engine speed

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
it's directly affecting the engine speed
and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.610> pulse<00:01:14.820> width<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.750> injectors<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and the pulse width of the injectors and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.640 
and the pulse width of the injectors and
the<00:01:16.680> ignition<00:01:17.009> advance<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.320> move<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the ignition advance if I move the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
the ignition advance if I move the
throttle<00:01:19.799> position<00:01:20.340> sensor<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.360> see

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
throttle position sensor you can see

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.130 
throttle position sensor you can see
it's<00:01:21.740> directly<00:01:22.740> related<00:01:23.240> an<00:01:24.240> exhaust<00:01:24.900> gas

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it's directly related an exhaust gas

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.399 
it's directly related an exhaust gas
oxygen<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.799> we<00:01:28.799> build<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.310> ECU's

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
oxygen and so on we build these ECU's

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.810 
oxygen and so on we build these ECU's
specifically<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> customer<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.400> tell

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
specifically to the customer so you tell

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
specifically to the customer so you tell
us<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:33.090> setup<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.799> sort<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.250> all

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
us your setup and we will sort out all

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
us your setup and we will sort out all
the<00:01:35.520> hardware<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:37.229> means<00:01:37.530> whatever

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the hardware for you this means whatever

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
the hardware for you this means whatever

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
will be constructed to see all extra

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.749 
will be constructed to see all extra
components<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.159> supplied<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.520> the

unit<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.540> didn't<00:01:45.840> use<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> case<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
unit that we didn't use just in case you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.899 
unit that we didn't use just in case you
want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> change<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.229> setup<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.799> using<00:01:50.280> for

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
want to change the setup you using for

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.660 
want to change the setup you using for
example<00:01:51.740> using<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> pulse<00:01:53.009> width<00:01:53.220> modulation

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.460 
example using a pulse width modulation
idle<00:01:54.090> valve<00:01:54.119> rather<00:01:54.689> than<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.020> stepper<00:01:55.229> motor

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
idle valve rather than a stepper motor

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.580 
idle valve rather than a stepper motor
sight<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.000> has<00:01:57.149> been<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.630> very<00:01:57.930> brief
