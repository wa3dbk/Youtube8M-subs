00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
 Applause the paint he is a general practitioner and has been caring for over 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.100
 20 years regularly 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.400
 Fasting groups 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.169
 Hello Doctor happy 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.359
 what are the common mistakes with box trailers 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.950
 the most common mistakes happen before fasting 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 that is, if you set the wrong goals you want for example 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.349
 Weight reducing weight loss and that is not the purpose of fasting sense 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.189
 the fast is coming out of the rigid of everyday others 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.619
 Dietary habits simply affect the body of a time of impact 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.320
 and that's the right time for fasting 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 and one should prepare well for the fast of one hundred 80 to zero it works 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.930
 Not 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.320
 I may not be tense professionally I should have no construction sites privately 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
 I have to prepare for that literally in a relaxed way 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.800
 I am in a state of health and currently can fast and how resilient I am then 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.720
 my fast as well as physically amazingly one is full 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.239
 resilient you can go to work 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.360
 You can even moderate sports should do sports 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.580
 they have one implied that I almost did not lose weight 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.890
 Damon's wife Luciana Zurich has it right next door to be around 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.110
 to decrease 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 Of course you will lose weight but most are disappointed when 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.869
 she's three four weeks after Lent 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.909
 Daniel's weight has the same weight as before it's one 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.959
 Fluid loss causes the metabolism is stimulated and it serves 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.670
 by no means reduce the weight to permanent weight what are 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.380
 because the critical phases adapt 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.690
 critical phases are the three points when I'm led to seduce by 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.420
 your own fridge or I pass the bakery 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.790
 and think instead of 30 times too of course the teammates who 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.470
 if you say you look bad you can check out what food it is 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.990
 that's it 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.920
 Times where you have to say no that can lead to break so fast 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.350
 Now so-called modified were almost developed with 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.330
 what is behind it? 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.810
 with the modified fast one wanted to counteract the muscle loss that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.219
 means the body has to be yes 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.329
 if he does not get his energy out of fact the post gets out of energy 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.259
 Muscle pulling and that leads to an unwanted muscle decline 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.640
 Muscle building was modified so that all the fasting is modified 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.870
 Fasting develops but has nothing to do with the classic fasting 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.199
 who should not fast under any circumstances 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:22.529
 That's what we do with high blood pressure 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.669
 Diabetics should not fast also for children under 14 I can 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.399
 do not recommend it and then there are 2 more people to consume 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.859
 Illnesses like cancer, for example, like 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.189
 Thyroid disease too because fasting can then come to an end 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.629
 Derailment of the thyroid gland 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.019
 but for the otto-normal consumer with a normal state of health 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.950
 they would already recommend not only recommend but 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.590
 and you should say in each year once recorded five days of fasting 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.549
 who really that Indira 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.879
 much learns the assessment
