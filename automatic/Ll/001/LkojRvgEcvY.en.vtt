the farmer is going to be very

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.830 
the farmer is going to be very
conservative<00:01:31.909> in<00:01:31.969> all<00:01:32.090> their<00:01:32.240> applications

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
conservative in all their applications

for multitude of reasons but you know
one<00:01:35.959> that's<00:01:36.079> very<00:01:36.380> obvious<00:01:36.560> from<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.039> farmer's

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
one that's very obvious from a farmer's

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.849 
one that's very obvious from a farmer's
perspective<00:01:37.819> is<00:01:37.969> the<00:01:38.389> cost<00:01:38.740> chemicals<00:01:39.740> are

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
perspective is the cost chemicals are

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.039 
perspective is the cost chemicals are
very<00:01:40.069> expensive<00:01:40.459> and<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.539> know<00:01:41.689> won't<00:01:41.899> know

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
very expensive and you know won't know

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.539 
very expensive and you know won't know
for<00:01:42.079> more<00:01:42.499> no<00:01:42.649> business<00:01:42.950> person<00:01:43.279> is<00:01:43.340> going<00:01:43.459> to
