 perfect nutrition facts for which there is rule 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.230
 Here also really extremely big than you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.760
 could also loose with twice the size 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.210
 make number of it starts with that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.460
 she heats some water and then that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.370
 Cinema is cooking for about 15 minutes 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.829
 already now increases a lot 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.989
 then take a banana and squeeze the 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:03.420
 then softly give it to yours 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.979
 two scoops protein powder and at this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 then do you have the opportunity and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.159
 something cinnamon of course and in the field 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.409
 Do you have the opportunity then the matter 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.880
 in two ways firstly in the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 He would have to have a refrigerator as much as possible 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.290
 a lot of water from the cinema is best 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.159
 a sieve and second in the oven is there 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.229
 it does not really matter 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.150
 Now we could do that here 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.490
 At the end, the cinema simply spooned it out 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.890
 the pot right in there but you see 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.990
 The cinema has a lot of water in it 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.850
 yourself and what you do what the whole 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 consistency of which makes it so fluid here 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.079
 that after that in the oven something else 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 water must evaporate there is 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 then a baking tray I make it to 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.420
 For example, my two baking trays have then 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.470
 also a very good regular size afterwards 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.600
 when you cut and how still 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.680
 I say a little spice 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.299
 give here for example a few of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.729
 my beloved coconut rasping over it 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.680
 a few almonds and you can do it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.659
 then if she has to pack it for 25 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.869
 minutes at 180 degrees in the oven 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.729
 just check the consistency until that 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.799
 reasonably solid then cuts 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.759
 is on the plate and it tastes good 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.450
