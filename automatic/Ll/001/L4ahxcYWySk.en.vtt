00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.830 
man oh Manischewitz as they say this
thing<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:06.000> pretty<00:00:06.839> amazing<00:00:07.309> here's<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:09.860> manual

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
thing is pretty amazing here's my manual

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.629 
thing is pretty amazing here's my manual
and<00:00:12.840> what<00:00:12.960> I'm<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> try<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.889> next<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and what I'm going to try to do next I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:24.609 
and what I'm going to try to do next I
think<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:19.279> maybe<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.670> upstairs<00:00:21.590> get<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
think is to maybe go on upstairs get a

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.189 
think is to maybe go on upstairs get a
USB<00:00:25.789> 2.0<00:00:27.740> cord<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.599> figure<00:00:30.840> out

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
USB 2.0 cord and see if I can figure out

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.380 
USB 2.0 cord and see if I can figure out
how<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:33.710> import<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:34.980> things<00:00:35.399> into<00:00:36.239> my

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
how to import these things into my

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
how to import these things into my
Macintosh<00:00:36.750> computer<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> hopefully

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
Macintosh computer and hopefully

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.350 
Macintosh computer and hopefully
eventually<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:39.530> Final<00:00:40.530> Cut<00:00:40.680> Express

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
eventually into Final Cut Express

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
eventually into Final Cut Express
maybe<00:00:43.140> after<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.219> reading<00:00:44.430> first

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
maybe after do a little reading first

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.290 
maybe after do a little reading first
the<00:00:45.719> concept<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the concept here is that the there is a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.279 
the concept here is that the there is a
built-in<00:00:52.020> 32<00:00:52.649> gigabyte<00:00:53.340> flash<00:00:53.610> memory<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
built-in 32 gigabyte flash memory in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.080 
built-in 32 gigabyte flash memory in
this<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.250> also<00:00:56.399> buy<00:00:56.760> external<00:00:57.420> cards

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
this and I can also buy external cards

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.549 
this and I can also buy external cards
Wow

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
Wow

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.789 
Wow
anyway<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> try<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.320> do

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
anyway and what I'm going to try to do

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.350 
anyway and what I'm going to try to do
is<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.710> connect<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.950> USB<00:01:08.790> from

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is see if I can connect the USB from

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.750 
is see if I can connect the USB from
this<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.200> computer<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:12.380> apparently

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
this to the computer and apparently

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.690 
this to the computer and apparently
supposedly<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:16.590> computer<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> show

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
supposedly the computer is going to show

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.260 
supposedly the computer is going to show
up<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> hard<00:01:18.810> drive<00:01:19.049> icon<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:19.860> desktop

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
up like a hard drive icon on my desktop

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
up like a hard drive icon on my desktop
and<00:01:22.580> at<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.880> point<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.840> either<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:26.490> into

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and at that point I can either go into

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.370 
and at that point I can either go into
Final<00:01:27.119> Express<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> log<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
Final Express and do the log and

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.789 
Final Express and do the log and
transfer<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:29.509> maybe<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.229> make<00:01:31.770> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
transfer or maybe see if I can make a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.940 
transfer or maybe see if I can make a
folder<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.460> my<00:01:32.909> external<00:01:33.720> hard<00:01:33.960> drive<00:01:34.320> drag
