00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.430 
and forth it survived a few vehicles I
think<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.190> was<00:03:30.310> buried<00:03:30.640> under<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.940> dirt<00:03:31.120> and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
think it was buried under the dirt and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.630 
think it was buried under the dirt and
the<00:03:32.440> snow<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.859> rain<00:03:32.890> we've<00:03:33.220> had<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.579> the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
the snow and the rain we've had in the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.789 
the snow and the rain we've had in the
last<00:03:33.700> couple<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.299> weeks<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:37.799> probably

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
last couple of weeks have probably

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.039 
last couple of weeks have probably
washed<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.459> out

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
washed it out

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.270 
washed it out
lucky<00:03:41.049> for<00:03:41.200> me<00:03:42.239> but<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:44.769> know<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:44.920> found<00:03:45.190> a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
lucky for me but you know I found a

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.160 
lucky for me but you know I found a
couple<00:03:45.430> other<00:03:45.639> points<00:03:45.940> here<00:03:46.239> last<00:03:46.810> time<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.079> was

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
couple other points here last time I was

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.840 
couple other points here last time I was
here<00:03:47.290> which<00:03:47.470> hasn't<00:03:47.829> been<00:03:47.950> about<00:03:48.579> two<00:03:48.819> weeks

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
here which hasn't been about two weeks

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.180 
here which hasn't been about two weeks
ago<00:03:49.150> with<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.600> rain<00:03:50.079> that's<00:03:50.290> no<00:03:50.470> we've<00:03:50.739> had<00:03:50.920> I
