00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.730
 in the modern gaming market already as 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.219
 few years mostly appreciated either 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.690
 huge projects 3 class or small 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.940
 indie games that authors put in 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.800
 his soul initially not focusing on 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.660
 profit and glory despite right 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.580
 proportional and the difference is not exactly 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 It turns out the highest gamers 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 ratings and diverge impressive 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.400
 draws however that game that will go 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.380
 speech today was able to absorb 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.140
 characteristics of both kinds so i 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 I don't even know where to put it 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.040
 called this player sa crashers and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 survived long ago in 2008 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.309
 year but only in digital form and only 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.290
 for xbox live arcade 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 two years later in mother or castles 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.190
 got to sing station network from and 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.780
 personal computers crawled only 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.969
 September 2012 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.860
 yes you can call me slophoka we 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.809
 all that but I note that this is not your headlights 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 edge 3 which will be recognized after the release 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 even blind and deaf and after a week and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 they forget it all the same game is not 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.100
 so famous to cause an explosion 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 gaming community but still 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.780
 Adequate attention developed at the studio 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 for the hippo that previously noted 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.479
 the release of the game allure homme is not her 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.210
 reissues 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.070
 but I will leave I am such a sin dry for the first time 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.020
 what if I was skipping classics or 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.970
 what else do you write there okay 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.259
 Essentially cash roof outset 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 reminds flash game 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.710
 and appearing at the beginning of the new portal logo 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.900
 with the count so much warms this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.790
 confidence however the deeper into the forest those 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 more wood what you are convinced later 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.960
 some 30 minutes after the start of the game 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.420
 the game begins in the best traditions 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.439
 beat em up of wide awake without 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.630
 long prefaces 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.520
 the player will be in the body of the knights 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.259
 at a medieval castle which at 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.320
 thoughts of the first day attack word or 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.330
 buddy of his grief with an evil magician 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.460
 robbers crush the courtyard and herself 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.240
 steals from the king the magic crystal and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.710
 flies away 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.840
 leaving their subjects creates 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.979
 atrocities have already guessed who needs 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.080
 will punish the villains 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.000
 Initially, the choice of the game pro is also worth it 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.130
 between the four characters however 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.960
 as you pass through and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.880
 performing in a special way various 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.080
 stages of the game we will open new 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.600
 characters with their own unique 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.009
 abilities appearance from the same 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.670
 what is initially the choice is between 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.009
 knight fire and lightning, and to all appearances 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.050
 bad breath after you 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.020
 have chosen a warrior to your liking throws you in 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.880
 fight with huge mobs of thugs 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.280
 apologizing to the anus instead of flying faces 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.110
 mice sharks jelly art 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.790
 some kind of incomprehensible ghouls skeletons 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.980
 damn, but who is there only no 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.900
 after all, these are ordinary opponents and sometimes 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.360
 meet and just steroid guys and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.040
 full databases last is often 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.500
 something unimaginable 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.930
 how do you like a huge floating code fin 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.790
 and the rider face his bags or flying 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.890
 the mouse on the fly defecating and straight on 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.380
 the main characters and this is generally tryndets 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.360
 some usually difficult to win 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.549
 only brute force only if 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.620
 any are there then they can bring up 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.360
 the river is people with weak nerves 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.760
 the fact that the train and here turned out 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.500
 noble and remembered for a long time by external 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.570
 kind of and spent on their murder 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.790
 nerve cells for killing bosses 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.230
 usually give any crestwood then either 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.180
 a chest filled with every kind 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.430
 goodies like bags of gold and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.530
 diamonds and the same gold can be spent 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.420
 for purchase in stores such utility 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.400
 as a weapon and on a one-time object steering 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.709
 first aid kits and bombs or extra pets 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.570
 the latter spend most of their time 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.670
 with the player and go into the so -called 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.440
 nursery where are kept all found by you 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.810
 animals after you pick up 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.700
 new pet in this kennel you 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.019
 can change your companion or 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.049
 learn about present every useful 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.030
 information again pet themselves 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.750
 differ as well as appearance and 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.910
 characteristics one can bring 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.710
 with the enemy things of the pipe can be well 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.780
 the third will get a chance of dodging everyones 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.670
 rare squeaks ways to remove 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.590
 but your over time all these things 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.180
 become more than necessary so 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.250
 as already a couple of hours after the start 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.140
 playing mothers locks presents to the player 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.180
 not illusory chelledzh forcing in advance 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.430
 purchased to put the blocks and generally lead 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.230
 battles are much more prudent than that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.850
 It is wise to treat distribution 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.370
 four main skill points 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.890
 parameters zion magic vitality and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.200
 speed and for the sake of a good example 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.420
 I will bring the real situation entirely 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.940
 downloaded by virtue of my friend speed and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.860
 survivability and if before it was ahead 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.660
 experience, now he has a character at level 6 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.940
 higher in reality despite the fact that all the time we 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.410
 played co-op the whole thing is that 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.130
 the enemies overthrew me from three four 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.109
 beats 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.329
 And I when glaciers are pumped into the stop force 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.250
 boast such skills could not here 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.050
 so on the other hand if you 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.820
 saddened by their pumping results 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.590
 then nothing prevents you from returning to 1 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.510
 and the level of farm opponents have ski 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.880
 which did not rise unlike your 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.320
 Occupation is not the most interesting but if 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.870
 you will not find another way out after that 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.729
 how an ordinary boss will take you 18 times 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.680
 hardly interested if 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.479
 quite difficult well and you just became 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.550
 bored then be sure to call with you 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.050
 friends excellent co-operative four 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.700
 man will seriously dilute the game 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.680
 process and it will bring mages on 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.950
 which even without this has ceased 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.140
 a game 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.760
 said crashers there is a lot of humor 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.770
 let her most high sample well 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.360
 causing more smile than desire 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 smash his face with your hand and only 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.110
 making the project more colorful in essence and 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.030
 it turns out that the orcs got quite 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.900
 long funny narrow on 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.419
 hardcore and most importantly fascinating 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.490
 Yes, there is not such a grafon as they are loaded 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.320
 such rpk elements as in skyrim not 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.729
 such an open world as far cry 3 and 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.610
 Plots such as in the game of thrones 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.070
 which game you do not do braid roof 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.380
 with my husband I will even say this the first hour of the game 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.660
 got emotions of pleasure even more 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.310
 than overheating all of the above 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.110
 project for someone is already worthy 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.699
 a reason to buy a license to the incentive and 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.770
 for the rest I said everything above 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.630
 anyway 10 dollars is not like that 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.889
 big money to spend it on a game or 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.500
 no, it's up to you 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.360
 and with you there was freeman 213 thanks for 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.160
 view comment study well 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.530
 eat and porridge love parents of the essence 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.530
 fingers in the socket all good luck and all bye
