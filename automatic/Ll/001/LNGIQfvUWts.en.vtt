00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 make more goals with this tutorial from a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.470
 against one with an opposing goalkeeper 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.690
 and then guys, I'm back because I 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.679
 They said that I'm cooler than the owner. 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
 of the channel 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 hahahahaha of course I am a popstar 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.490
 you fucking certainly missed some 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.830
 goals alone with goalkeeper, right? 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.199
 feels like sticking your fingers in the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 own tail and rip the right club 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.150
 Let's solve this. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.149
 there are several ways to score goals 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.090
 one-on-one as you can see one 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.969
 volley shot placed within the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.760
 outside the area but want to explain 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.430
 the best of them to prevent you from causing 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.879
 this irreparable damage in the rego 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 let's go there first an analysis of the field 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.379
 when you start up on yourself 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.360
 a goalkeeper tends to position his 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.850
 Fat back right in front of your 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 player and it is common for us to follow 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.109
 straight as in the picture 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.420
 When you kick in that position, the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.640
 euÃ¢nus is in danger because the goalkeeper 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.920
 Usually grab and you will want 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.350
 rip off the coolies 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.299
 What you need to do is start 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.430
 run diagonally when you arrive 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.530
 close to the ball 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.270
 pass a little the goalkeeper's line 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 and kick it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 How are you running and the goalkeeper is? 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.259
 slow and it can not close the angle 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.229
 on time and you will always make the goal 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.840
 mainly his attacker was fast 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.310
 let's take a look at the same tactic of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.920
 high resolution 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.350
 You do not have to run too far. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.700
 but who loses the angle of the kick is the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.950
 your player 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.640
 just a small ravine for one of the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 sides 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.180
 preferably of the strongest leg of the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.790
 your player 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.380
 furthermore, only the ball passes the line 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.899
 goalkeeper defense 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.119
 even if the player has not passed 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.700
 Of course, the ideal is that the two 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.770
 ball and player so that the goal is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.579
 grinning at you like you do not even bitch 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.610
 cio 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.840
 but this is not the only easy way in 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.149
 few moments 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 it's worth grabbing the side 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 moments before kicking 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.870
 close to the goalkeeper to see this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.710
 super command hyper ninja surfer 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.720
 blaster 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.810

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.160
 is attacking right 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.740
 you will be pointing the lever of the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.670

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.670
 goalkeeper 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.050
 you lightly point the lever on the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.990
 left down 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.810
 if the player is right-handed or up 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.340
 for left-handed and squeezes the ball or b in the xbox 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.910
 to kick
