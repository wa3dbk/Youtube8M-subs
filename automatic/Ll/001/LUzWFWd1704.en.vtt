00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.620
 Hi everyone, I'm Ammon from Kolob Push the Limit. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.040
 Today I'll show you with a slackline on the beach using 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.520
 an anchor called the "dead man ancor" 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.100
 First of all we must procure a shovel, two axes at least 20 centimeters wide 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.120
 80 and at least 2 or 3 centimeters long to be strong enough. 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.199
 An old towel or a rag, 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.440
 two tripods or supports and obviously a slackline, which in this case is Gibbon's Jib Line x13 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.000
 great for doing tricks. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.900
 We start by choosing a flat area quite far from the sea and far from people and objects. 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.940
 We support one of the two boards on the ground 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.440
 and we dig a pit as wide as our axis and at least a meter and a half deep. 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.059
 Once finished, we wrap our towel around the board 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.160
 so as not to damage the slackline and tie it over using the loop I can at the end of the rope. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.030
 At this point, lower the axis into the pit and secure yourself 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 that once the bottom is touched the axis is flat, if not so 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.260
 you can give it a few strokes with the back of the shovel to put it well in contact with the ground. 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:18.420
 Now remove the sand in front of the exit of the slack line so that it comes out of the ground more or less 45 degrees 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.180
 and that it comes out flat without twisting, with the print facing upwards. 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.799
 Fill the hole with the sand you pulled out by compacting the best possible 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.939
 and always making sure that the slackline is slightly taut. 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.750
 Do the exact same thing on the other end of the rope making sure that 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 don't go sand in the metallic ratchet because it could damage it. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 Once that is done, take the stand or your stand 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.060
 and place it a meter or a half or two from the rope exit. 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.200
 Pass rope through the holes, if you have a perforated support like me 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 or above your stand so that the rope remains flat and straight. 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.920
 Then place the support on the ground. Spread the slackline up to the ratchet 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.060
 and let it pass into the second support always keeping it at two meters from the exit. 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.420
 Now thread the slackline into the ratchet and stretch the rope slightly, 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.640
 raise the supports leaving them tilted 60 degrees outwards. 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 The low tension of the rope and the vertical support are important factors 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 on the fall of the supports during your slackline exercise. 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.060
 To give more tension, without having to use the ratchet, 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.470
 just approach the base of the support to the exit of the slackline from the ground. 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.820
 This procedure can create extremely high voltages for your slackline 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.780
 that you will never be able to reach with the sole use of a ratchet. 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.120
 For these tensions it will take a lot of strength to lift the supports. 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 Now you are ready to perform your more or less crazy stunts safely on the sand. 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.713
 If you need to leave the slackline in a specific place for several days, 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.900
 to ensure that it is not damaged and not left unattended during the night, 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.410
 fix the boards to bury a rope 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.090
 or a chain to which to tie the slackline at a later time so as to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.270
 being able to put it on and take off easily. 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.959
 Once finished it will be necessary 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.239
 unearthing the whole process longer than burying the axes, as 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.590
 you will have to be careful not to damage the rope by digging with the shovel e 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.172
 we will have to make a hole even bigger than the first. 

00:03:14.172 --> 00:03:19.690
 Don't forget to close all the holes as they could be very dangerous and remember, 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.530
 PUSH THE LIMIT!
