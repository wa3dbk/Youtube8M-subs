experiences and my thoughts on it now

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
experiences and my thoughts on it now
there's<00:00:23.130> not<00:00:23.220> too<00:00:23.490> much<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> say<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.300> 50

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
there's not too much to say about a 50

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.710 
there's not too much to say about a 50
millimeter<00:00:25.080> lens<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.859> 55<00:00:26.449> but<00:00:27.449> one

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
millimeter lens this is a 55 but one

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.000 
millimeter lens this is a 55 but one
thing<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> noticed<00:00:28.380> right<00:00:28.529> away<00:00:28.590> when<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
thing that I noticed right away when I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.910 
thing that I noticed right away when I
rented<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> price<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.420> $1000<00:00:31.320> which

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
rented it is the price it is $1000 which

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
rented it is the price it is $1000 which
does<00:00:32.219> seem<00:00:32.489> kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.969> spendy<00:00:33.420> for<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> 50

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
does seem kind of spendy for a 50

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.170 
does seem kind of spendy for a 50
millimeter<00:00:34.290> that's<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.309> something<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.910> AF

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
millimeter that's not something like AF

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.350 
millimeter that's not something like AF

plastic fantastic $400 it's nice and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.090 
plastic fantastic $400 it's nice and
sharp<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.170> more<00:00:49.350> expensive<00:00:49.590> about

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
sharp this is a lot more expensive about

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.430 
sharp this is a lot more expensive about
10<00:00:50.370> times<00:00:50.550> more<00:00:50.730> expensive<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
10 times more expensive but what do you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
10 times more expensive but what do you
get<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.129> extra<00:00:53.520> money<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.719> definitely

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
get for that extra money so I definitely

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
get for that extra money so I definitely
you<00:00:55.320> got<00:00:55.410> something<00:00:55.649> that's<00:00:55.770> small<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you got something that's small for a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.369 
you got something that's small for a
full<00:00:57.270> frame<00:00:57.510> lens<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.960> mean<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
full frame lens I mean it's not that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.990 
full frame lens I mean it's not that
much<00:00:58.859> smaller<00:00:59.190> especially<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.760> big

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
much smaller especially with this big

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
much smaller especially with this big
lens<00:01:00.239> hood<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.960> still<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:01.379> small<00:01:01.649> size<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
lens hood but still its small size it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.450 
lens hood but still its small size it's
a<00:01:02.430> very<00:01:02.640> nice<00:01:02.850> build<00:01:03.180> quality<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
a very nice build quality and it is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
a very nice build quality and it is
weatherproof<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.939> has<00:01:06.090> weather<00:01:06.360> sealing<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
weatherproof or has weather sealing you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
weatherproof or has weather sealing you
have<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.710> nice<00:01:07.920> really<00:01:08.580> smooth<00:01:08.909> focus

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have a really nice really smooth focus

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
have a really nice really smooth focus
ring<00:01:09.630> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> fly-by-wire<00:01:10.350> system<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
ring which is the fly-by-wire system and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.060 
ring which is the fly-by-wire system and
it's<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.360> responsive<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it's actually really responsive for a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's actually really responsive for a
fly-by-wire<00:01:14.760> system<00:01:15.390> I've<00:01:15.540> used<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.200> couple

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
fly-by-wire system I've used a couple

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.870 
fly-by-wire system I've used a couple
other<00:01:16.710> systems<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> they're<00:01:17.850> not

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
other systems like that and they're not

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.660 
other systems like that and they're not
very<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.689> compared<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.250> standard

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
very good compared to just a standard

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
very good compared to just a standard
type<00:01:20.970> focusing<00:01:21.570> system<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.409> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
type focusing system but this one is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
type focusing system but this one is
very<00:01:22.740> nice<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> very<00:01:24.330> nice<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.570> sharp

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
very nice it's a very nice and sharp

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
very nice it's a very nice and sharp
like<00:01:25.140> most<00:01:25.409> 50<00:01:25.740> millimeters<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.520> F<00:01:26.670> 1.8<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
like most 50 millimeters it's a F 1.8 so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
like most 50 millimeters it's a F 1.8 so
you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.689> nice<00:01:27.869> shallow<00:01:28.229> depth-of-field

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you can get nice shallow depth-of-field

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
you can get nice shallow depth-of-field
and<00:01:29.250> here's<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.299> sample<00:01:30.720> footage<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and here's just some sample footage I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
and here's just some sample footage I
have<00:01:31.890> some<00:01:32.130> low-light<00:01:32.460> footage<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.060> my

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
have some low-light footage on my

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
have some low-light footage on my
channel<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.869> shot<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.590> eighty

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
channel that I shot with this at eighty

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
channel that I shot with this at eighty
thousand<00:01:35.189> ISO<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.270> turned<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.630> pretty<00:01:36.810> good

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
thousand ISO that turned out pretty good

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.460 
thousand ISO that turned out pretty good
especially<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.070> 2000<00:01:38.610> ISO<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.360> amazing

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
especially for a 2000 ISO it's amazing

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
especially for a 2000 ISO it's amazing
as<00:01:40.860> far<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.070> sharpness<00:01:41.549> though<00:01:41.729> here's<00:01:42.000> some

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
as far as sharpness though here's some

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.090 
as far as sharpness though here's some
photos<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.869> I'll<00:01:42.960> go<00:01:43.140> ahead<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.680> crop<00:01:43.860> in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
photos and I'll go ahead and crop in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
photos and I'll go ahead and crop in
100%<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> sharpness<00:01:45.570> in

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
100% so you can see the sharpness in

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
100% so you can see the sharpness in
detail<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.740> very<00:01:47.100> nice<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> wanted

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
detail it's very nice but what I wanted

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
detail it's very nice but what I wanted
to<00:01:48.750> mention<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> wish<00:01:49.890> could<00:01:50.130> have

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to mention is what I wish could have

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.870 
to mention is what I wish could have
been<00:01:50.430> better

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
been better

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.530 
been better
I<00:01:51.079> think<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.290> Sony<00:01:53.009> implemented<00:01:53.820> some<00:01:54.060> optical

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
I think if Sony implemented some optical

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.840 
I think if Sony implemented some optical

image stabilization built into the lens

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.569 
image stabilization built into the lens
it<00:01:57.390> would<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.899> been<00:01:57.990> absolutely<00:01:58.579> fantastic

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it would have been absolutely fantastic

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.450 
it would have been absolutely fantastic

role<00:02:04.979> issues<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.299> really<00:02:06.600> helped

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
role issues it would have really helped

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.479

for<00:02:07.200> handheld<00:02:07.619> shooting<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.280> nice

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
for handheld shooting you get nice

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.809 
for handheld shooting you get nice
smooth<00:02:08.879> video<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.110> you'd<00:02:10.979> fix<00:02:11.370> some<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819
