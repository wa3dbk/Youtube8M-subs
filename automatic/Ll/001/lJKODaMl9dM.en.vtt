00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
don't know how it does but I guess the

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.800 
don't know how it does but I guess the
fact<00:06:50.790> that<00:06:50.970> I<00:06:51.060> don't<00:06:51.300> try<00:06:51.450> and<00:06:51.510> make<00:06:51.630> myself

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
fact that I don't try and make myself

active<00:06:52.260> on<00:06:52.380> reddit<00:06:52.710> or<00:06:52.770> anything<00:06:53.040> like<00:06:53.070> that

active on reddit or anything like that

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.010 
active on reddit or anything like that
that's<00:06:53.580> probably<00:06:53.790> why<00:06:54.120> I'm<00:06:54.270> not<00:06:54.420> as<00:06:54.660> popular

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
that's probably why I'm not as popular

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.340 
that's probably why I'm not as popular
and<00:06:55.530> I<00:06:56.520> can<00:06:57.000> I<00:06:57.030> just<00:06:57.420> sound<00:06:58.110> completely
