00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
type of stuff on top of that it's going

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.410 
type of stuff on top of that it's going
to<00:01:41.660> have<00:01:41.930> 2<00:01:42.410> gigabytes<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:43.130> RAM<00:01:43.400> so<00:01:43.700> again<00:01:44.270> like

to have 2 gigabytes of RAM so again like

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.899 
to have 2 gigabytes of RAM so again like
I<00:01:44.510> said<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.870> best<00:01:45.050> of<00:01:45.170> both<00:01:45.290> world<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.490> it's

I said the best of both world and it's

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.080 
I said the best of both world and it's
gonna<00:01:47.090> all<00:01:47.390> maintain<00:01:48.230> the<00:01:48.640> 2100<00:01:49.640> milliamp

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
gonna all maintain the 2100 milliamp

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.970 
gonna all maintain the 2100 milliamp
hour<00:01:50.270> battery<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.260> I'm<00:01:51.350> getting<00:01:51.500> excited<00:01:51.650> to

first three carriers SK Telecom KT and
LG<00:02:27.160> U+<00:02:28.060> apparently<00:02:28.690> those<00:02:28.900> are<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.110> carrier's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
LG U+ apparently those are the carrier's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.170 
LG U+ apparently those are the carrier's
I<00:02:29.620> don't<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.070> too<00:02:30.130> much<00:02:30.370> about<00:02:30.520> courier<00:02:30.940> so

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
I don't know too much about courier so

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.210 
I don't know too much about courier so
I'm<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:32.050> reading<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.440> off<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.860> guys

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
I'm just reading it off for you guys

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.580 
I'm just reading it off for you guys
anyways<00:02:33.820> it'll<00:02:34.090> come<00:02:34.210> out<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.450> battery<00:02:35.260> life

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
anyways it'll come out of battery life

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.290 
anyways it'll come out of battery life
because<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.490> might<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.030> quad-core

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
because you might know that quad-core

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.700 
because you might know that quad-core
takes<00:02:37.720> up<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.960> lot<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.230> battery<00:02:38.590> life

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
takes up a lot of battery life

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.330 
takes up a lot of battery life
especially<00:02:39.390> LTE<00:02:40.390> LTE<00:02:40.860> basically<00:02:41.860> brings<00:02:42.190> your

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
especially LTE LTE basically brings your

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.730 
especially LTE LTE basically brings your
battery<00:02:42.670> life<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.350> mixing<00:02:44.350> those<00:02:44.500> two

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
battery life and mixing those two

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.500 
battery life and mixing those two
together<00:02:44.950> especially<00:02:45.430> considering<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.300> fact

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
together especially considering the fact

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.410 
together especially considering the fact
that<00:02:46.600> LTE<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.890> quad-core<00:02:48.400> CPUs<00:02:48.850> are<00:02:49.030> not<00:02:49.240> well

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that LTE and quad-core CPUs are not well

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.750 
that LTE and quad-core CPUs are not well
integrated<00:02:49.690> at<00:02:50.200> this<00:02:50.410> time<00:02:50.650> yeah<00:02:50.830> as<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> as<00:02:51.340> of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
integrated at this time yeah as a as of

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.300 
integrated at this time yeah as a as of
July<00:02:52.030> 5th<00:02:52.300> that<00:02:52.630> they<00:02:52.720> I'm<00:02:52.840> making<00:02:53.080> this<00:02:53.140> video

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
July 5th that they I'm making this video

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.130 
July 5th that they I'm making this video
it's<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.610> gonna<00:02:55.090> compromise<00:02:55.930> your

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's really gonna compromise your

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.870 
it's really gonna compromise your
battery<00:02:56.500> life<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.980> you're<00:02:57.100> gonna<00:02:57.220> see<00:02:57.459> really

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
battery life and you're gonna see really

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.090 
battery life and you're gonna see really
low<00:02:58.030> battery<00:02:58.390> life<00:02:58.570> times<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.050> even<00:02:59.950> though

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
low battery life times and even though

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
low battery life times and even though
cuz<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> 2100<00:03:01.840> milliamp-hour

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
cuz you have a 2100 milliamp-hour

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.720 
cuz you have a 2100 milliamp-hour
battery<00:03:02.230> sure<00:03:02.740> that's<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.100> really<00:03:03.430> really

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
battery sure that's a really really

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.460 
battery sure that's a really really
strong<00:03:04.000> battery<00:03:04.300> but<00:03:04.840> you're<00:03:04.990> still<00:03:05.260> gonna<00:03:05.380> be

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
strong battery but you're still gonna be

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.050 
strong battery but you're still gonna be
getting<00:03:05.830> your<00:03:06.040> batteries<00:03:06.640> still<00:03:06.730> gonna<00:03:06.910> be

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
getting your batteries still gonna be

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.970 
getting your batteries still gonna be
draining<00:03:07.330> even<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.050> just<00:03:08.230> turn<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.680> on

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
draining even if you just turn it on

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.560 
draining even if you just turn it on
you<00:03:09.280> sure<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.730> don't<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.030> won't<00:03:10.270> even<00:03:10.390> know

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
you sure you don't you won't even know

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.940 
you sure you don't you won't even know
you're<00:03:10.780> using<00:03:10.990> your<00:03:11.200> LT<00:03:11.440> maybe<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.830> you're

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
you're using your LT maybe if you're

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.520 
you're using your LT maybe if you're
disabled<00:03:12.370> you're<00:03:12.490> all<00:03:12.550> te<00:03:12.820> connection<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
disabled you're all te connection in the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.170 
disabled you're all te connection in the
first<00:03:14.740> place<00:03:14.890> then<00:03:15.100> then<00:03:15.490> you<00:03:15.640> might<00:03:15.820> have<00:03:16.150> a

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
first place then then you might have a

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.900 
first place then then you might have a
bit<00:03:16.570> more<00:03:16.600> battery<00:03:17.050> life<00:03:17.200> but<00:03:17.740> besides<00:03:18.490> the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
bit more battery life but besides the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.699 
bit more battery life but besides the
battery<00:03:19.360> life<00:03:19.510> that's<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> only<00:03:20.019> downside<00:03:20.260> so

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
battery life that's the only downside so

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.650 
battery life that's the only downside so
there's<00:03:20.980> not<00:03:21.310> nothing<00:03:21.700> else<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.180> kind<00:03:22.630> of

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
there's not nothing else that's kind of

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.509 
there's not nothing else that's kind of
a<00:03:22.750> downer<00:03:22.930> about<00:03:23.320> this<00:03:23.470> phone<00:03:23.650> maybe<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.400> might

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
a downer about this phone maybe it might

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.040 
a downer about this phone maybe it might
be<00:03:24.580> more<00:03:24.820> expensive<00:03:25.000> they<00:03:25.390> never<00:03:25.600> revealed
