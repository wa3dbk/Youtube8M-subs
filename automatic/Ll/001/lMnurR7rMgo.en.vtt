 Hola Hola people and should get 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.349
 and ends at Treknews de 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.349
 yes, I have it in percent 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.880
 it is the WestLB spoke off 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.189
 a team's match com to go Kimberly Boone attack 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.899
 Vettel Â«Yes we stand where grows 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.899
 and the 14-lead 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.210
 yes also Peugeot will be synonymous 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.550
 These 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.970
 played 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 and got 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.750
 "I'm patient." Lexa was right, whatever that is that it is now 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.970
 absolutely not important 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.460
 "That's not the topic is complex around 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.370
 if my uncle's topic is 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.040
 Lawyer no longer costs this way why so many bored around the game 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.630
 and 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.060
 it is boring and at all and whatever 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.950
 around 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 so not in the beginning I personally um 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.770
 to be easier 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.990
 to say in advance that India 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.860
 wants to attack next to his opinion respectively 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.520
 I know what percent claimed 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 to speak for the general public 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.470
 or to 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.070
 What ever 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.440
 you can think of things for it 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.280
 rtr "I believe ten Bayer Umar Faruk man around 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.410
 with the use is 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.600
 Black Ops is not boring 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 Backhaus is fun for me 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.720
 Wackers will 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.720
 who is liable if one plays too much in a row 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.150
 and by should be his player 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.240
 Sometimes it means that you are not one with two 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.430
 that you do not like them officially not that they just me just something 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.880
 different game 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 Because if you play it so I personally so noticed 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.100
 if you turn the light behind Nadal soft and around 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.100
 you just like it around 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.649
 Percent star has to do out of what to do or noted 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.319
 his 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.379
 then it can be that one closer 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.659
 designed to hatred the game 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.669
 Jahns I just a bit 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.499
 we see yes 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.170
 "The hacker lets go of the game 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.799
 she is supposed to play five players with it and 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.260
 with the field fell 70 o'clock with grip and fast fire with Klose and ticks 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 Sheens to run around and have fun 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.959
 I do not want to say anything against these weapons against their bodies now 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.389
 say a similar meter to a common water feature 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.849
 So he means the judges 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.859
 Euro players change something else 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.930
 Black Ops is not as bad as some think and 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.949
 some of you may have experienced this lately 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.569
 because, after many, we want to see something different 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.559
 Well, I personally 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.609
 would like to do it again 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.689
 Vision of such a hearing so I do not mind 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.059
 but at the moment I still have many sales teams open 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.809
 I would like to speak and therefore 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:18.809
 Comte also son Black Ops gameplay underpinning 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.139
 being around 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.269
 soda 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.039
 to video he puts on the account 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.429
 as in this case now 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:29.290
 who, then? 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.570
 he's my opinion anyway 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.190
 a Chihuahua other for example the Tufa years after its value of 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.229
 network 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.869
 that through to 2 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.989
 Anastasia Fold is not linked to that on the screen 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.329
 could break through 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.229
 and if you have not seen it yet and you are interested in that 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.489
 could then 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.929
 around 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:50.909
 years 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.149
 Dead Space so i also have a few like that somebody is coming and 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.509
 I am quite funny and thought it over 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.489
 but yes, learning game by itself is not for me 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.920
 since he is alcohol and Aldi special 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.349
 come pretty far 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.349
 and it's fun to listen to you 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.829
 Coco sir 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.230
 really reconciliatory 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.339
 you do not have the two now here 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.060
 I do not know yet as I am so the CEO Vineet defending little 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:17.969
 played 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:18.959
 around 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.949
 of each of two per se 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.319
 also not suitable as a reason for the sudden 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.379
 it's up to the game to play 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.770
 more like how can we say we have been very durable respectively 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.990
 he ends up on the allegations 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.479
 It's just a game that does not involve too much action in a short time 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.020
 wrote with Michaela 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.830
 Profite yourself 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.699
 that's worrying on YouTube that's 12% out there misses RWE 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.460
 was enough because you really learn 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.930
 Whenever he has the time to get back to the top then he has to 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.229
 z-wave and which Bomba has to race for a slip over the whole 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.999
 Landscape with its around 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.519
 March racing car or from there percent go and 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.040
 who cares? 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.419
 Ehrmann Schmackes liked and I'm sure and is live from the 2 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.020
 only guess 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.610
 maybe you can do it what you do, why the action scenes so to speak 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.699
 cuts together 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.900
 and we had yes 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.050
 but that's normal to see if I'm fine with the Greens 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.139
 be uploaded 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.289
 because we see if he experiences it like me 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.499
 and what Lehmann Fawcett's coming on Monday 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.099
 later something else 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.550
 and the world realize that Black Ops is sunny 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.770
 so bad that the band might think 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.419
 feel claim 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.539
 yes, um 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.659
 Berlusconi say the video belongs 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:43.349
 how it from there Danone nine rounds 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.580
 Naumann you can do it 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.219
 Percent comes Rothen Zion or 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.370
 and take if you are 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.900
 fallen a lot 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.069
 or else how long or longer would it be 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:53.899
 and sure
