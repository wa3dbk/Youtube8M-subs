00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
silent cues I like to use silence when I

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.730

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
taught them the positions recently so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.710 
taught them the positions recently so
they'll<00:00:19.439> slide<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:21.150> I'll<00:00:21.300> check<00:00:21.539> all

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
they'll slide up and and I'll check all

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.929 
they'll slide up and and I'll check all
of<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.260> might<00:00:22.470> comment<00:00:22.980> positively<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.910> a

the correct things we're teaching really

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.939 
the correct things we're teaching really
important<00:00:58.050> skills<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.340> early<00:00:59.579> days

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
important skills here in the early days

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.579 
important skills here in the early days
sometimes<00:01:01.949> I'll<00:01:02.910> sign<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.570> them<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.320> see

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
sometimes I'll sign with them if I see

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.230 
sometimes I'll sign with them if I see
that<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.640> having<00:01:05.760> trouble

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
that some of them are having trouble

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
that some of them are having trouble
sometimes<00:01:07.020> I'll<00:01:07.170> point<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> ladder

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
sometimes I'll point to the ladder

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.969 
sometimes I'll point to the ladder
behind<00:01:08.640> me<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.780> they<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.740> they

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
behind me so that they know that they

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.030 
behind me so that they know that they
can<00:01:11.189> use<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.670> ladder<00:01:12.530> trying<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.920> all

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
can use that ladder trying to get all

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
can use that ladder trying to get all
the<00:01:14.310> habits<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.820> place<00:01:15.229> early<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the habits in place early in them in the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
the habits in place early in them in the
method<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> use<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:18.810> habits

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
method so that they can use those habits

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
method so that they can use those habits
throughout<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> method<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.100> success<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
throughout the method with success that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
throughout the method with success that
we<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:25.189> ask<00:01:26.189> them<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> take

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
we want them to have I ask them to take

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.780 
we want them to have I ask them to take
a<00:01:26.790> look<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> ladder<00:01:28.159> that<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> inside<00:01:29.640> your

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
a look at the ladder that is inside your

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.630 
a look at the ladder that is inside your
lesson<00:01:30.030> plan<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.540> tell<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.710> notice<00:01:32.159> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
lesson plan and I tell them to notice to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700 
lesson plan and I tell them to notice to
tell<00:01:32.850> me<00:01:33.030> why<00:01:33.329> they<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.079> ladder<00:01:34.409> be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
tell me why they think this ladder be

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.999 
tell me why they think this ladder be
tricky<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.250> climb<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.200> always<00:01:37.439> notice

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
tricky to climb and they always notice

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
tricky to climb and they always notice
the<00:01:38.040> small<00:01:38.460> step<00:01:38.850> between<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.630> course<00:01:39.900> me<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the small step between of course me and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.800 
the small step between of course me and
fly<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.470> T<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.860> O<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.210> them<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> do

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
fly and T and O and we want them to do

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.780 
fly and T and O and we want them to do
that<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:44.009> them<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> stare<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that so we just have them to stare at it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.069 
that so we just have them to stare at it
and<00:01:44.939> look<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.689> child<00:01:45.960> will

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and look at it and then a child will

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.999

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
enough that they could do any fuss a lot

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.710 
enough that they could do any fuss a lot
like<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.670> they<00:03:32.790> really<00:03:33.239> hear<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.569> want

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
to make it really obvious because their

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.610 
to make it really obvious because their
ears<00:03:35.220> are<00:03:35.430> new<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.030> no<00:03:36.630> I'm<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:36.840> trained<00:03:37.350> yet

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
ears are new and no I'm not trained yet

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.720 
ears are new and no I'm not trained yet
so<00:03:38.000> we<00:03:39.000> want<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.269> help<00:03:39.390> help<00:03:39.959> them<00:03:40.109> hear<00:03:40.319> it

thought<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.420> me<00:03:48.600> I'll<00:03:48.720> make<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> step<00:03:49.170> too<00:03:49.350> big

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
thought to me I'll make a step too big

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.460 
thought to me I'll make a step too big
on<00:03:49.970> purpose<00:03:50.970> we<00:03:51.450> like<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> make<00:03:51.930> them<00:03:52.139> laugh

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.500 
on purpose we like to make them laugh
and<00:03:52.769> remember<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.609> that's<00:03:54.030> how<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.239> call

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
and remember and that's how you call

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.620 
and remember and that's how you call
their<00:03:54.750> attention<00:03:54.920> into<00:03:55.920> those<00:03:56.639> half<00:03:56.940> steps<00:03:57.359> so

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
their attention into those half steps so

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.210 
their attention into those half steps so
that<00:03:57.750> they<00:03:57.870> learn<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.500> listen<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.069> bit

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
that they learn to listen a little bit

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.220 
that they learn to listen a little bit
better<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.060> humor<00:04:00.359> works<00:04:00.569> great<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
better and the humor works great and

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.289 
better and the humor works great and

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
then when you play the game on this day

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.229 
then when you play the game on this day
make<00:04:03.900> sure<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.170> play<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.950> sing<00:04:05.310> lots<00:04:05.940> of
