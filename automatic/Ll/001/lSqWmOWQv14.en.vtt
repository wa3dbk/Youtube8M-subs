00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
it's as if they grab the random first
freighters<00:01:45.840> drawing<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.530> throw<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
freighters drawing and just throw it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.280 
freighters drawing and just throw it
into<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.280> game<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.450> goes<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.049> seems

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
into the game so this goes on what seems

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
into the game so this goes on what seems
like<00:01:49.530> forever<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> timer<00:01:51.000> which

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
like forever you have a timer which

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.730 
like forever you have a timer which
doesn't<00:01:51.540> make<00:01:51.630> much<00:01:51.840> sense<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.560> you're

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
doesn't make much sense because you're

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
doesn't make much sense because you're
going<00:01:52.890> along<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> constant<00:01:53.610> pace<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.509> not

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
going along at a constant pace I'm not

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
going along at a constant pace I'm not
sure<00:01:54.869> why<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.200> even<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:55.860> while<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
sure why it's even there well while you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.649 
sure why it's even there well while you
have<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> ability<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.850> extend<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.420> time

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
have the ability to extend that time

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
have the ability to extend that time
there's<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.590> nothing<00:01:59.040> special<00:01:59.340> about

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
there's really nothing special about

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.510 
there's really nothing special about
this<00:01:59.939> mode

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
this mode

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.310 
this mode
oh<00:02:01.960> boy<00:02:02.960> more<00:02:03.619> wall-climbing

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
oh boy more wall-climbing

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.600 
oh boy more wall-climbing
okay<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.350> understood<00:02:06.979> before<00:02:07.399> we<00:02:07.520> were

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
okay I understood before we were

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.949 
okay I understood before we were
climbing<00:02:07.880> up<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.179> building<00:02:08.420> because<00:02:08.660> we<00:02:08.780> were

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
climbing up a building because we were

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.900 
climbing up a building because we were
on<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.170> ground<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.190> were<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.369> flying

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
on the ground but we were just flying

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.510 
on the ground but we were just flying
I'm<00:02:11.870> sure<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.290> could<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.530> flown<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.130> top

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'm sure we could have flown to the top

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.010 
I'm sure we could have flown to the top
instead<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.880> getting<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.569> then<00:02:14.989> just

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
instead of getting out and then just

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.280 
instead of getting out and then just
balling<00:02:16.010> our<00:02:16.130> way<00:02:16.310> up<00:02:16.520> barehanded<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:18.140> but

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
balling our way up barehanded not but

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.280 
balling our way up barehanded not but
then<00:02:18.440> again<00:02:18.650> he<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.950> stuntman<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.050> all<00:02:21.050> right

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
then again he is a stuntman so all right

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.440 
then again he is a stuntman so all right
slugga<00:02:21.830> you're<00:02:22.130> going<00:02:22.400> down<00:02:22.610> now<00:02:23.330> I'm

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.070 
impressed with the big characters here
but<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.819> don't<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.090> room<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.450> really<00:02:26.630> move

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
but you don't have room to really move

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.570 
but you don't have room to really move
around<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.470> use<00:02:27.590> much<00:02:27.860> strategy<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.459> don't

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
around and use much strategy I don't

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
randomly I really can't do much here but

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.160 
randomly I really can't do much here but

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.449 
passes us by the play control is more
difficult<00:03:26.720> than<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.170> car<00:03:27.440> level<00:03:27.769> before<00:03:27.890> as

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
difficult than the car level before as

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.670 
difficult than the car level before as
the<00:03:29.000> steering<00:03:29.299> is<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.480> little<00:03:29.510> slippery<00:03:30.200> but

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
the steering is a little slippery but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.229 
the steering is a little slippery but
there's<00:03:30.859> also<00:03:31.040> more<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.430> these<00:03:31.579> ramps<00:03:32.060> in<00:03:32.150> the

there's also more of these ramps in the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.300 
there's also more of these ramps in the
level<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.600> have<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.810> hit<00:03:33.230> or<00:03:33.769> else<00:03:33.920> your<00:03:34.069> time
