hi<00:00:01.620> everybody<00:00:01.860> my<00:00:02.190> name<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.429> Dakota<00:00:02.580> Cooper<00:00:03.179> I

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi everybody my name is Dakota Cooper I

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi everybody my name is Dakota Cooper I
just<00:00:03.540> want<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.750> give<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.959> quick

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
just want to give you a quick

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.590 
just want to give you a quick
introduction<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> use<00:00:05.520> well<00:00:06.270> what's

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
introduction and how to use well what's

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.240 
introduction and how to use well what's
called<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.899> Mickey<00:00:07.200> Mickey<00:00:07.410> then<00:00:07.830> use<00:00:07.980> it<00:00:08.069> at<00:00:08.160> my

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
called a Mickey Mickey then use it at my

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.530 
called a Mickey Mickey then use it at my
classroom<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.820> couple<00:00:09.059> years<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:09.300> it's

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
classroom for a couple years now it's

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.160 
classroom for a couple years now it's
really<00:00:09.690> great

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
really great

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.070 
really great
so<00:00:11.000> basically<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.240> gist<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:12.929> a

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
so basically the gist is it's a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.680 
so basically the gist is it's a
buildable<00:00:13.530> circuit<00:00:14.009> board<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:15.240> when<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.480> plug

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
buildable circuit board so when you plug

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.210 
buildable circuit board so when you plug
it<00:00:15.839> into<00:00:15.960> your<00:00:16.080> computer<00:00:16.230> your<00:00:17.100> computer

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
it into your computer your computer

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.910 
it into your computer your computer
reads<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> keyboard<00:00:18.420> when<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> circuit

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
reads it as a keyboard when the circuit

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
reads it as a keyboard when the circuit
circuit<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.580> created<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.119> down<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
circuit is created from down here the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.400 
circuit is created from down here the
ground<00:00:22.140> bar<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.760> say<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.910> up<00:00:24.029> arrow<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
ground bar and say the up arrow what it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.859 
ground bar and say the up arrow what it
literally<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.580> tells<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:27.359> computer

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
literally does is it tells your computer

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.509 
literally does is it tells your computer
that<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.320> arrow<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.740> pressed<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that the up arrow is pressed so on the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.030 
that the up arrow is pressed so on the
front<00:00:29.789> you've<00:00:29.939> got<00:00:29.970> up-down<00:00:30.599> left-right

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
front you've got up-down left-right

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
front you've got up-down left-right
space<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.369> click<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:35.239> you've

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
space and click and on the back you've

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.530

got<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:37.230> letters<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> every<00:00:39.390> one<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
got a lot more letters so every one of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.090 
got a lot more letters so every one of
those<00:00:39.719> holes<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.260> can<00:00:40.469> plug<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> wire<00:00:41.070> into

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
those holes you can plug a wire into

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
those holes you can plug a wire into
you've<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.399> grounds<00:00:45.059> lots<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.079> stuff

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you've got more grounds lots of stuff

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.590 
you've got more grounds lots of stuff
this<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> plug<00:00:48.420> the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
through my body with my classes it'll

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.600 
through my body with my classes it'll
connect<00:01:54.140> through<00:01:54.439> an<00:01:54.560> entire<00:01:54.829> class<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.369> 30

connect through an entire class of 30
you<00:01:56.299> like<00:01:56.509> instantly<00:01:57.079> like<00:01:57.770> it<00:01:57.890> doesn't<00:01:58.069> take

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
you like instantly like it doesn't take

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.510 
you like instantly like it doesn't take
it<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.579> long<00:01:58.729> time<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:01.009> I'm<00:02:01.069> going<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.219> set<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.460> up

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
it a long time so I'm going to set it up

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:12.610 
it a long time so I'm going to set it up
with<00:02:01.670> some<00:02:01.850> alligator<00:02:02.240> clips<00:02:02.569> to<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:12.470> up

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
with some alligator clips to the up

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.890 
with some alligator clips to the up
arrow<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.430> there<00:02:13.579> are<00:02:13.700> tons<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.329> tons<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
arrow so there are tons and tons of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.030 
arrow so there are tons and tons of
different<00:02:15.019> things<00:02:15.349> that<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.530> could<00:02:15.769> do<00:02:15.920> with

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
different things that you could do with

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360 
different things that you could do with
this<00:02:16.540> anything<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.840> let's<00:02:18.530> say<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.709> video

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
this anything like let's say a video

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.630 
this anything like let's say a video
game<00:02:19.730> emulator<00:02:20.239> your<00:02:20.599> kids<00:02:20.900> could<00:02:21.310> create<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
game emulator your kids could create the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.210 
game emulator your kids could create the
circuits<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.329> make<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> keyboard<00:02:24.170> work<00:02:24.620> they

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
circuits to make the keyboard work they

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.809 
circuits to make the keyboard work they
could<00:02:25.430> create<00:02:26.920> there's<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.010> video<00:02:28.220> they<00:02:28.610> made<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
could create there's a video they made a

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.170 
could create there's a video they made a

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
go to music sound it's going to play

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.680 
go to music sound it's going to play
drum<00:03:11.569> 1<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:13.269> then<00:03:14.269> when<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.849> up<00:03:17.090> arrow<00:03:17.450> is

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
drum 1 and then when the up arrow is

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.589 
drum 1 and then when the up arrow is
pressed<00:03:18.639> it's<00:03:19.639> going<00:03:20.150> to

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.699 

play<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.200> bass<00:03:26.409> drum<00:03:27.390> now<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.540> says<00:03:28.749> for<00:03:28.989> 0.25

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
play a bass drum now it says for 0.25

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.569 
play a bass drum now it says for 0.25
beats<00:03:30.040> I'm<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.519> change<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:30.999> 2.01<00:03:32.579> so

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
beats I'm going to change that 2.01 so

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:51.010 
beats I'm going to change that 2.01 so
that<00:03:33.730> we<00:03:33.819> can<00:03:34.030> play<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:34.719> faster

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.210 

so<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.590> take<00:03:51.860> my<00:03:52.100> keyboard<00:03:52.760> over<00:03:52.970> here<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:55.040> can

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
so I take my keyboard over here you can

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:04.449 
so I take my keyboard over here you can
see

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.410 

automata<00:04:05.420> range<00:04:11.079> there<00:04:12.079> we<00:04:12.200> go

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
automata range there we go

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.849 
automata range there we go
so<00:04:14.420> all<00:04:14.569> I<00:04:14.599> did<00:04:14.870> was<00:04:15.049> click<00:04:15.230> inside<00:04:15.650> this

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
so all I did was click inside this

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:23.590 
so all I did was click inside this
insert<00:04:16.280> organ<00:04:21.610> so<00:04:22.610> it's<00:04:22.729> all<00:04:22.850> online<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.330> you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
insert organ so it's all online so you

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.810 
insert organ so it's all online so you
don't<00:04:23.870> have<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.620> install<00:04:24.979> anything<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:27.820> put

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
don't have to install anything so put

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.129 
don't have to install anything so put
this<00:04:28.940> back<00:04:29.180> down<00:04:30.880> so<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:32.000> had<00:04:32.120> such<00:04:32.389> space<00:04:32.780> and

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
this back down so we had such space and

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:57.010 
this back down so we had such space and
up<00:04:33.289> arrow<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:33.830> if<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:34.009> connect<00:04:34.340> these<00:04:34.490> two<00:04:56.020> so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
up arrow so if I connect these two so

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.180 
up arrow so if I connect these two so
that's<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.320> circuit<00:04:57.680> going<00:04:57.889> through<00:04:58.070> my

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
that's the circuit going through my

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.540 
that's the circuit going through my
whole<00:04:58.370> body<00:04:58.430> now<00:04:59.240> it'll<00:04:59.690> go<00:04:59.780> through<00:04:59.960> kids

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
whole body now it'll go through kids

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.920 
whole body now it'll go through kids
it'll<00:05:01.550> go<00:05:01.759> through<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.030> whole<00:05:02.240> class<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.750> kids

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
it'll go through a whole class of kids

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.550 
it'll go through a whole class of kids
it<00:05:03.410> really<00:05:03.680> helps<00:05:03.919> them<00:05:04.039> understand<00:05:04.990> how<00:05:05.990> that

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
it really helps them understand how that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.050 
it really helps them understand how that
electricity<00:05:07.400> is<00:05:07.669> working<00:05:09.370> in<00:05:10.370> this<00:05:10.699> scratch

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
electricity is working in this scratch

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.180 
electricity is working in this scratch
that<00:05:11.240> MIT<00:05:11.599> does<00:05:12.020> not<00:05:12.229> have<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.560> be<00:05:12.650> music<00:05:12.979> based

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
that MIT does not have to be music based

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.659 
that MIT does not have to be music based
there's<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.370> motion<00:05:16.820> there's<00:05:17.810> motion<00:05:18.050> stuff

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
there's a motion there's motion stuff

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.320 
there's a motion there's motion stuff
that<00:05:19.669> controls<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:20.360> cat<00:05:20.659> on<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:22.370> larger<00:05:22.820> XY

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
that controls this cat on that larger XY

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.140 
that controls this cat on that larger XY
grid<00:05:23.889> so<00:05:24.889> you<00:05:24.979> can<00:05:25.099> make<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.340> cat<00:05:25.580> move<00:05:25.820> ten

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
grid so you can make the cat move ten

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.510 
grid so you can make the cat move ten
steps<00:05:28.360> he<00:05:29.360> can<00:05:29.389> rotate<00:05:29.750> degrees<00:05:30.349> you<00:05:31.159> can<00:05:31.340> make

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
steps he can rotate degrees you can make

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.980 
steps he can rotate degrees you can make
them<00:05:32.289> move<00:05:33.289> to<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.530> specific<00:05:33.740> XY<00:05:34.520> point<00:05:34.990> so

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
them move to a specific XY point so

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:48.570 
them move to a specific XY point so
that's<00:05:36.139> all<00:05:36.289> pretty<00:05:36.470> cool<00:05:36.880> looks

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:57.760 

so<00:05:49.120> lots<00:05:49.660> of<00:05:49.780> cool<00:05:49.990> stuff<00:05:50.020> here<00:05:50.550> sensing

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.950 

it's<00:05:58.130> pretty<00:05:58.340> cool

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.190 

can<00:06:01.530> tell<00:06:02.120> it<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.330> can<00:06:03.480> tell<00:06:03.690> it<00:06:03.810> what<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.080> do

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
can tell it you can tell it what to do

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.500 
can tell it you can tell it what to do
