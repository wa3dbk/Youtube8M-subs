00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
snow with some glitter glue and I decide

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.749 
snow with some glitter glue and I decide
to<00:01:56.649> do<00:01:56.800> it<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:56.979> handwriting<00:01:57.250> just<00:01:57.580> cuz<00:01:57.700> I

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
to do it in handwriting just cuz I

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.830 
to do it in handwriting just cuz I
thought<00:01:57.910> it<00:01:58.000> looked<00:01:58.090> at<00:01:58.270> prettier<00:01:58.660> but<00:01:58.780> you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
thought it looked at prettier but you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.990 
thought it looked at prettier but you
can<00:01:58.960> do<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.110> however<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.440> want<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.069> then<00:02:00.910> I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
can do it however you want and then I

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.059 
can do it however you want and then I
just<00:02:01.179> put<00:02:01.390> some<00:02:01.420> glitter<00:02:02.050> silver<00:02:02.590> glitter<00:02:02.890> on

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
just put some glitter silver glitter on

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.859 
just put some glitter silver glitter on
top<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.819> automatically<00:02:04.240> sticks<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.750> it

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
top and it automatically sticks to it

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.540 
top and it automatically sticks to it
because<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.560> is<00:02:05.710> glitter<00:02:06.039> glue<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.399> had

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
because it is glitter glue that I had

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.340 
because it is glitter glue that I had
used<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.940> originally<00:02:07.300> write<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.539> out<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:07.990> then

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
used to originally write it out and then

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.900 
used to originally write it out and then
I<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:08.619> push<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.920> down<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.369> tap<00:02:09.640> off<00:02:09.850> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
I just push it down and tap off the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.210 
I just push it down and tap off the
excess<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.539> then<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.260> am<00:02:11.470> cutting<00:02:11.830> out<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
excess and then I am cutting out a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.760 
excess and then I am cutting out a
snowman<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.240> use<00:02:13.390> my<00:02:13.569> lace<00:02:13.780> fabric<00:02:14.290> for<00:02:14.620> it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
snowman and I use my lace fabric for it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.559 
snowman and I use my lace fabric for it
and<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.580> thought<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.790> looked<00:02:15.880> super<00:02:16.180> cute

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and I just thought it looked super cute

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.030 
and I just thought it looked super cute
and<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:17.050> added<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.410> kind<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.770> winter

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and it just added that kind of a winter

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.809 
and it just added that kind of a winter
feel<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.520> it

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
feel to it

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.340 
feel to it
I<00:02:18.850> originally<00:02:19.360> tried<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> snowflake<00:02:20.080> but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
I originally tried to do a snowflake but

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.020 
I originally tried to do a snowflake but
failed<00:02:20.560> miserably<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.250> decided<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.790> stick

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
failed miserably so I decided to stick

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.670 
failed miserably so I decided to stick
with<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> Snowman<00:02:22.600> and<00:02:22.840> then<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.319> just<00:02:23.500> used

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
with the Snowman and then I just used

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.100 
with the Snowman and then I just used
some<00:02:23.830> cardboard<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.760> add<00:02:25.030> his<00:02:25.360> little<00:02:25.690> hat<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
some cardboard to add his little hat and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:38.620 
some cardboard to add his little hat and
buttons

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.940 

and<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.930> next<00:02:40.110> canvas<00:02:40.560> isn't<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:40.920> much

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
and so this next canvas isn't as much

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740 
and so this next canvas isn't as much
winter<00:02:41.310> themed<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:41.940> am<00:02:42.090> using<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.480> really

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
the next DIY I'm just going to be

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.160 
the next DIY I'm just going to be
painting<00:02:57.000> mason<00:02:57.330> jars<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:57.930> actually

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
painting mason jars and I'm actually

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.050 
painting mason jars and I'm actually
painting<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.800> outside<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.310> them<00:02:59.460> because<00:03:00.000> I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
painting the outside of them because I

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.250 
painting the outside of them because I
find<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.360> gives<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> bit<00:03:00.900> more<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.110> like<00:03:01.230> a

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
find that gives it a bit more of like a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.980 
find that gives it a bit more of like a
rustic<00:03:01.800> look<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.240> have<00:03:03.420> one<00:03:03.690> mason

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
rustic look to it and I have one mason

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.420 
rustic look to it and I have one mason
jar<00:03:04.170> that's<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.500> little<00:03:04.770> bit<00:03:04.860> bigger<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.370> then

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
jar that's a little bit bigger and then

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.160 
jar that's a little bit bigger and then
what<00:03:05.940> I'm<00:03:06.030> doing<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.330> kind<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.570> spice<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.990> up<00:03:07.050> a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
what I'm doing to kind of spice it up a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.300 
what I'm doing to kind of spice it up a
little<00:03:07.200> bit<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.740> a<00:03:07.830> lot<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.070> people

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
attached I just use a push pin and I

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.650 
attached I just use a push pin and I
attach<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.950> my<00:03:40.980> ceiling<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.269> love<00:03:42.540> the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
attach it to my ceiling and I love the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.360 
attach it to my ceiling and I love the
way<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.900> looks<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.440> actually<00:03:43.560> spins<00:03:44.069> on

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
way this looks and it actually spins on

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.770 
way this looks and it actually spins on
its<00:03:44.400> own<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.269> would<00:03:45.390> actually<00:03:45.480> suggest

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
its own and I would actually suggest

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.900 
its own and I would actually suggest
making<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.380> few<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.709> them<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.099> then<00:03:47.519> hanging

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
making a few of them and then hanging

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.339 
making a few of them and then hanging
them<00:03:48.060> over<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.569> bed<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:48.989> something<00:03:49.260> like

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
them over your bed or something like

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.350
