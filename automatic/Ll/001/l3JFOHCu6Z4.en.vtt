00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello everyone welcome on mac rover 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 today little test in the games of 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.660
 mac mini 2.6 ghz core i7 so the model 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.830
 The most powerful but without a 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.780
 dedicated graphic so just with the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.010
 bintel hd 4000 see what it gives with 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
 anyway some surprises 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 so we start with deus ex who is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.870
 a game that still requires a lot of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.460
 performance besides warns us in 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.010
 throwing that sheila not necessarily be 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.230
 very fluid so we have launched it in 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.740
 1024 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.970
 concretely it's still playable so this 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 game works well there with 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.560
 resolutions not too high despite everything 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 so we do not see the picture well but he 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.800
 there are small lakes from time to time and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.440
 then it's not very very fluid at the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 Mouse mouse a little 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 delay compared to your movements so 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.899
 not very nice even in small 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.809
 small resolutions disgrace when 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.360
 even this game even if it's for for for 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.360
 to do just the show it can be enough 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.590
 so we're going to have a laugh and we 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.270
 launches and so in 2560 so the resolution 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.620
 of the 27 inches on which we had launched 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.250
 the game then there is absolutely 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.960
 uncontrollable did not swim maybe 7 8 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.460
 frames per second marriage block of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.810
 times for several seconds 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 so we really have to be satisfied with 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.189
 1024 big maximum on this match or so 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 we go on with batman arkham city who 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.040
 just out on mac 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020
 so it's a pretty interesting title 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.820
 since there is a lot 3d there is a lot 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.930
 of decorations 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.790
 it's also a platform game is a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.770
 action game so it requires a machine 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.700
 who responds well 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.380
 so before we start the game we were 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.180
 quite pessimistic about what was going 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 give and finally big surprise 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630
 batman really works well on 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.130
 this machine 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.479
 as you see on the screen so the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.650
 mouse I answer very well we are little 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.350
 close to 40 frames second and we have no 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.970
 no frustration during the fighting 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.710
 so even with a lot of characters 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.760
 on the screen we never had very big 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.190
 slowdowns that would prevent us 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.780
 really yellow and so the numbers we 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.400
 rather give us reason since there 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.980
 you see it so we are in 1280 and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.150
 then the number of frames per second and in 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.650
 average to top 40 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.720
 it goes up to 50 and it goes down 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.120
 up to 18 19 which means that 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 the twig game hardly ever 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.610
 except when the levels are really 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.480
 complex when there are a lot of 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.480
 buildings for example borrowed 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.150
 so to have fun we still 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.560
 tried with the maximum resolution so 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.810
 that of the 27 inches of apple 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.459
 as you see it's absolutely 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.840
 disastrous since we are around 13 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.940
 average seconds images 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.080
 and then often below that's so 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.570
 it's really unplayable to this 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.000
 resolve their mafia ii it's a game 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.800
 which came out a year ago on mac and that we 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.600
 love a lot but unfortunately 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.280
 can really enjoy it takes a 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.080
 good graphics card what knows 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.000
 the whole case here we are around 20 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.920
 second images and his sorrow enormously 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.420
 cliff level becomes complex where 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.030
 case of fighting so we will tend 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.410
 still to discourage the game except at 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.320
 to play really is very very low 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.120
 resolution but here it is in 1981 and 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.290
 you see that it is difficult to have voltage 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.290
 per second 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.190
 then another game we like 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.010
 test and that's pretty fun it's 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.740
 lego batman 2 which plunges you into 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.640
 the universe of batman but lego way and to 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.890
 our surprise 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.750
 this title is perfectly playable on the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.950
 mac mini so that's a guy really 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.660
 very fun ie we are halfway 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.180
 between an adventurous action game 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.690
 platform could be likened to a 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.280
 little bit of zelda naked mario so there 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.600
 we are at 40 50 frames per second see 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.180
 that the graphics are not at all 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.070
 ridiculous and that it's absolutely very 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.240
 fluid and we still put a good 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:43.660
 level of detail since the game is in 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:43.660
 1280 give them to me sir 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.250
 we get to starcraft 2 which is 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.310
 much more demanding at the 3d level 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.130
 CPU level also by default we are in 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.210
 1280 with the graphics at least so 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.790
 that's what the game offers you 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.560
 when you launch so at the top left 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.320
 you see the frame number 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.070
 which is around 20 seconds in all 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.570
 case during the fighting 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.950
 which is a bit scary since we are 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.950
 really at the minimum level of detail 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.490
 then with a small 2 then the unit 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.780
 still on the screen so if you see any 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.520
 second images 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.320
 same thing we are around May 25 with 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.510
 big europe around 15 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.950
 which means that to manage these 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.960
 units it's really not very easy 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.360
 so just for fun when we started 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.590
 the game with everything thoroughly so you the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.180
 see it's absolutely unplayable on 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.100
 fourteen frames second with three 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.550
 units on the screen is salty is still 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.370
 in dissolute life 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.600
 then the same scene in medium this time 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.680
 you see we have around 20 images 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.940
 seconds but there are pretty much 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.700
 units on the screen which is still 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.290
 really not so good for the solo 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.520
 it can still go but it's true that 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.930
 their networks 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.050
 I am using myself not even to put myself in 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.060
 medium for a part completely so 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.919
 on a game that's about two years old it 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.300
 only really playable with all 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.759
 graphics at least what changes 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.409
 still a lot of play comfort 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.940
 you see here that we have about 30 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.300
 images / second during a good fight 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.250
 but by being all or minimally 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.569
 on starcraft ii 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.889
 there we were a little worried about 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.440
 driver since on the imac 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.759
 we had a lot of jerks and there 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.000
 still a nice surprise on this 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.349
 machine the game turns perfectly you 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.770
 see on the screen it's really very 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.720
 fluid 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.509
 there is no jerkiness one must be around 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.880
 40 frames second this is 1280 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.470
 with the graphics so at least in 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.789
 is even ahead but a little bit 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.860
 further in the game so with a lot 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.770
 of buildings a lot of cars we did not 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.030
 almost no problem in the other 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.830
 good surprise is when you increase 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.330
 still the quality so quality 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.830
 high where he always has me a lot of 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.680
 frames per second and that's really 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.639
 nice to not be deprived 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.020
 driver it's really a game a board 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.789
 if we take a lot of fun 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.469
 and then the car gets well in hand 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.969
 quite easily the service life is 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.009
 rather good especially since there are 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.479
 network games after then just for the 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.650
 fun we had fun setting up the resolution 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.400
 maximum going there I do not know if it's 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.009
 sees very well in the image 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.349
 in fact the game is still fluid but 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.080
 very slow so that's not to lose 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.639
 pictures I think that's their technique 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.449
 but suddenly at the spa very playable in 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.830
 on 7- inch havas in resolution 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.830
 native of course 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.810
 in the long run it's small trick with a 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.810
 play so he just went out that's fine 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.880
 2012 who frankly did not bluff us 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.229
 graphically we're gonna say it's 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.000
 very playable the sensations are good 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.919
 but that the level of detail is not 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.690
 crazy so very logically it turns 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.190
 pretty much on his mini mac as soon as 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.979
 you are not too greedy revolution 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.840
 you stay in 1280 obviously on a 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.940
 horse 7 inches in native resolution 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.320
 it's practically unplayable but here we 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.580
 we have good feelings even that we 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.010
 have a lot of participants there are some 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.270
 sets that are a bit more complex 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.740
 there is no problem to play 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:46.330
 so we will obviously advise rather 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.160
 a controller for that kind of days 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.470
 so good and bad for this mac 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.240
 vintage line 2012 which allows to 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.800
 still play a number of good 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.780
 games but it's going to be a lot more 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.940
 difficult for games within a year or 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.560
 two years otherwise we can also 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.030
 advised to install windows that allows 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.340
 to win in general 20 to 30% of 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.260
 Performance x 100% by starcraft
