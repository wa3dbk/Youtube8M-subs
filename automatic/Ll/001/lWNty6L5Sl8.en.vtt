power<00:00:49.670> any<00:00:50.059> DC<00:00:50.600> powered<00:00:51.290> pedal<00:00:51.590> on<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.800> planet

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
power any DC powered pedal on the planet

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.670 
power any DC powered pedal on the planet
and<00:00:52.940> works<00:00:53.660> really<00:00:53.840> great<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.200> got<00:00:54.350> my<00:00:54.500> whole

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
and works really great I got my whole

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.670

ability to switch between two different
speeds<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:43.820> there's<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.479> glide<00:01:44.720> time

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
speeds and then there's a glide time

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.289 
speeds and then there's a glide time
there<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.920> as<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.700> go<00:01:46.820> from<00:01:46.939> slow<00:01:47.180> to<00:01:47.210> fast

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
there that as you go from slow to fast

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.090 
there that as you go from slow to fast
determines<00:01:48.080> how<00:01:48.140> long<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.439> takes<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.740> speed<00:01:48.950> up

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
determines how long it takes to speed up

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:47.119 
determines how long it takes to speed up
and<00:01:49.220> slow<00:01:49.310> down

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.330 

and<00:02:48.129> lastly<00:02:48.810> ecolution<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.340> ecolution

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and lastly ecolution to ecolution

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.160 
and lastly ecolution to ecolution
squared<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.150> know<00:02:52.629> it's<00:02:52.870> got<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.019> lot<00:02:53.049> of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
squared I know it's got a lot of

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.270 
squared I know it's got a lot of
fingerprints<00:02:53.680> on<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.830> that's<00:02:54.040> because<00:02:54.190> we

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
fingerprints on it that's because we

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.699 
fingerprints on it that's because we
can't<00:02:54.519> stop<00:02:54.760> touching<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.330> this<00:02:56.019> pedal<00:02:56.560> and

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
can't stop touching it this pedal and

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.750 
can't stop touching it this pedal and
it's<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.549> little<00:02:58.269> brother<00:02:58.480> down<00:02:59.110> there<00:02:59.760> are

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
it's a little brother down there are

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.789 
it's a little brother down there are
both<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.380> yeah

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
both that one yeah

this thing stand out is that we let the

heard a couple of people say over the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.250 
heard a couple of people say over the
years<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.419> our<00:04:31.570> pedals<00:04:31.870> are<00:04:32.020> slightly

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
years that our pedals are slightly

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.810 
years that our pedals are slightly
complicated<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:33.039> that<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.550> really

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
complicated and that you have a really

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.520 
complicated and that you have a really
steep<00:04:34.090> learning<00:04:34.120> curve<00:04:34.539> so<00:04:34.750> with<00:04:35.409> the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
steep learning curve so with the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.060 
steep learning curve so with the
evolution<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.099> a

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
acquisition squared we decided to make

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040 
acquisition squared we decided to make
it<00:04:40.100> even<00:04:40.370> more<00:04:40.400> complicated<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:41.540> give<00:04:41.960> you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
it even more complicated but give you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.690 
it even more complicated but give you
preset<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:42.860> can<00:04:43.010> get<00:04:43.130> between<00:04:43.370> all
