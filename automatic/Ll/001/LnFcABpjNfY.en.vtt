00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.349
 glasses really is not something to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.089
 the last thing costs money further 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.550
 but nevertheless if for example you need 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.189
 24 frets on guitar 22 do not change this 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 sensors you change exactly if you want 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.650
 same thing let's say there I do n't know 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 from own convenience yes that is, we 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.890
 Now we are saying all this theoretically 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.240
 equal any guitar choice starts on 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 the fact that you pick up and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 as soon as you like it on after 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.579
 it is already possible to compromise 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.200
 give more money up there and so on 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.469
 that is, if only she was herself because 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.930
 cool that is here for example on the author 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.370
 gref like weaving rather round he 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 narrow enough I will tell you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.030
 relatively big enough 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.110
 radius from above yes that is exactly 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 lining radius 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.649
 if we compare with any modern 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.120
 ebany now we take the moment let's say 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.629
 so here is the wealth that he detailed in 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.570
 This case is not very important uyebany for 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.200
 Yes, we immediately see that the neck is wider 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 that's what it is flatter 2 and 3 that u 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.880
 he is very very very large radius then 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 eat and know that it is very flat further 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.290
 up than the flatter reef the general 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 speaking easier to play on the last 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.909
 positions well i.e. 10 is it possible 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.890
 agree but somehow it means 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.259
 it's more comfortable to play the guitar and especially 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 bend here on 2 oct ohl 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.920
 because unfortunately on many 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.600
 Routers of the investigation of the neck 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.310
 bands at a low chair height and just 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.439
 but it is more convenient to play something 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.869
 definitely or in general in general 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.210
 Here that is another thing that for example 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.970
 take barrett on the fingerboard with a smaller 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.610
 radius easier hair latitude 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.590
 wider width what does width mean 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.149
 another conversation that is it seems to me 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.460
 that all the same is more a matter of taste just 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.320
 historically it happened that 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.500
 tools here 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.060
 arisen there a dozen yes like some such 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 for virtuosos yes that is there steve vai 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 satriani other such people they are 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.910
 otherwise, you prefer the instrument with 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.729
 wider neck 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.960
 how to cut is not sure at all the choice 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.610
 the choice of the finder is actually this 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.740
 correct for those who assault fender and gibson 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.450
 that there is nothing again and when if we 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.160
 look at these strikes 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.290
 talking about this tool means 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.840
 why am i not exactly countries take the rain 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.320
 undoubtedly ohrenel tones of the wounded, too 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.090
 at least in which he borrowed money asks 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.470
 then here is the difference what you have here 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.620
 there is a red tree 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:39.830
 it's not typical of what you said 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.870
 just the village of kent that is to say 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.660
 principle is pretty easy to add 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.489
 there is an example of nectar practice 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.320
 the tree is not always easy to want here 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.900
 This is definitely mahogany the same 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.940
 the most from which do gibson though u 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.800
 him too many varieties mean 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.900
 what does it really mean weights in 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.060
 electro guitar plays a role enough 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.160
 Essentially although we always repeat 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.019
 find exceptions but nonetheless again 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.470
 if you have 20 physical vacuums 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.420
 quickness 1 of them will be alder tree in 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.739
 be a mahogany friend with 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.970
 sufficient confidence to state that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.390
 Mahogany will sound a little bit 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.940
 dumber that's not with much warmth it sounds with 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.350
 a great lot of bulk here is alder 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.989
 accordingly give out more open 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.060
 clearer brighter sound that's clear 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.530
 will give such a poke on the bottom 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.030
 the middle is so thicker 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.799
 sound and very such a biting arch 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.110
 aggressive accordingly this guitar 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.420
 again yes you are many nuances 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.810
 she is not quite the center of materials 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.790
 the world is not at all that is a mismatch 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.829
 sound in sound can be assumed 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.390
 my of course i will repeat everything on 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.060
 let's listen to the theory without practice 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.440
 worth nothing but you can already say that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 she's by design pretty strong 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.709
 different to that tomato which we 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.380
 used to see sin here 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.900
 respectively made swing that's 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.310
 there is again material extremely characteristic 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.959
 this may be a little unexplored 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.720
 when mass production ibanez they him 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.150
 love to make bass guitar neck though 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.150
 great rarity 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.860
 that is defender 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.360
 press the neck there will be a step maple that is 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.220
 probably I am now some kind of modern 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.440
 on owned from from some exotic 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.660
 Syrian red sofa griffin but it 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.430
 all the same for the shape of the picture is extremely 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:23.480
 uncharacteristically 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:24.860
 so why is there more here that 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.960
 concerns this tool in principle 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.460
 cool that's all the more so by the way 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.890
 good comparison yes it is with us 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.570
 American this and it is with you and enjoys 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.070
 here they stand in general about them 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.140
 the same money the difference is thousand rubles a wheel 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.930
 Bliss means what to pay 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.410
 attention once again, always take the guitar 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.000
 in hand for you is most important with 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.680
 technical point of view the most important 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.690
 vulture you play that is there may be 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.510
 less anything a grave and 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.790
 expensive to repair here we see the first 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.650
 the line is not rebuilt anchor 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.080
 there is not that it is necessary somehow 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.220
 it is easy to notice 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.800
 you can see what you have but here you are 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.240
 matched big if the neck was 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.120
 direct it is obvious that here she is small 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 here it is big here it is even bigger and here 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.110
 we have this situation here is the distance 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.060
 small here is big and here in general 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.620
 small again it means that you have them 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.450
 It has such a form, by the way. 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.490
 check it like this 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.530
 a little bit amateurish but it's usually 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.250
 helps means clamping 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.210
 one finger neck on the first fret 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.020
 pinch the finger on the second finger 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.430
 last owner 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.290
 the string turns into a ruler it 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.050
 it is stretched straight a great body not 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.330
 very much and accordingly this gap 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.690
 a little bit missing fingers this one 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.950
 gap 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.840
 here it is actually indicated at the moment 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.880
 between the water streams on the sixth string 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.960
 he indicates the actual deflection of the neck he 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.780
 should not be very big 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.520
 that is, it should be like this here 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.350
 so here it is 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.860
 should actually hasan should 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.720
 we are almost there a small hall in short i am to 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.020
 what you look at hanging 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.090
 electro guitar here right here of course 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.850
 the question is just building an anchor not 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.410
 be lazy anyway somehow 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.810
 there responsible for this tool 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.300
 somehow scratch so they pulled 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.310
 the vulture that you found out if the anchor works 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.390
 in general, that is, this guitar does not work 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.580
 need to get round 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.100
 you invest is like Mihin very money 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.120
 It is for the replacement of antero by the way there is more 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.440
 on extra gloomy reflections 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.810
 folk here is this thing 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.060
 mean strictly speaking to lax them 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.120
 crumbles very easily since he 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.490
 thick enough and it fits badly 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.650
 gracie do not need all why whiteness should 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.130
 where as the real lacoste Ladynina 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.900
 is there an emptiness between the wacom vulture here 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.310
 that is, the principle can just fall off 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.590
 from some blow which then 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.270
 nothing for myself hello but since 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.210
 here is this stump you hide 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.670
 sled is not very reverent 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.980
 and God forbid that so again if 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.540
 see u have a guitar 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.820
 the deflection is very large or vice versa 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.950
 on the contrary too stormy back behind the neck is not 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.600
 be lazy to do something like this 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.760
 to give you a key or twist something 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.020
 have you want to check how I do here 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.310
 no need to unwind this 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.410
 hole yes actually into it 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.700
 inserted stop what's desirable 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.030
 of course there were a little bit especially 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.470
 someone else's part that's just spin 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.970
 make sure it works what 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.580
 deflection really changes what if not 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.130
 only the pipe is changing, that is, there is repair 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.200
 may cost I don't know the case is hushed up 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.330
 say 300 rubles per sense if here 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.130
 anyway cooler anchor but if there 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.720
 I do not know that he burst or if you his 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:31.390
 then fixation went, it's expensive, but 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.880
 there are detected ways and a conversation 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.170
 here though when this means 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.600
 tool again yes we are at it 

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:42.190
 We look it is important not to be deceived 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:45.550
 typewriter cars become a separate talk 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.500
 roller machine somehow present 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:51.790
 on all sides like guitar almost on 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:54.040

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.480
