00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
only problem with it is that it's a long

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.940 
only problem with it is that it's a long
way<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.280> get<00:03:41.519> there<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:43.380> is<00:03:43.530> extremely

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
way to get there and it is extremely

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.130 
way to get there and it is extremely
hard<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.610> get<00:03:44.760> them<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.269> will<00:03:45.480> die<00:03:45.720> at<00:03:45.930> them

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
hard to get them you will die at them

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.360 
hard to get them you will die at them
unless<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.430> really<00:03:47.670> good<00:03:47.850> attack

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
unless you have a really good attack

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.809

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
but with all that aside it is actually a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.280 
but with all that aside it is actually a
very<00:03:52.090> good<00:03:52.239> method<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.870> we<00:03:52.900> will<00:03:53.140> go<00:03:53.260> there

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
very good method and we will go there

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:01.150 
very good method and we will go there
