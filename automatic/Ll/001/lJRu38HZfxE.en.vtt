00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.529 

this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> wrench<00:00:22.350> oh<00:00:22.560> no<00:00:22.859> my<00:00:23.220> bad<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:24.449> was

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
this is a wrench oh no my bad that was

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.130 
this is a wrench oh no my bad that was
right<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:24.810> time<00:00:26.810> all<00:00:27.810> right<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
right the first time all right and the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.299 
right the first time all right and the
right<00:00:28.289> side<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.800> did<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.670> notice<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.390> had<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
right side one did you notice I had a

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.299 
right side one did you notice I had a
this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.500> for<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> brake<00:00:34.800> line<00:00:35.010> going

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
this is for the for the brake line going

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.940 
this is for the for the brake line going
down<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.870> actually<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.260> mounts<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
down so this actually just mounts up to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.709 
down so this actually just mounts up to
here<00:00:38.190> said<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.790> had<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.480> and

here said you had to take out this and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.540 
here said you had to take out this and
it<00:00:40.050> does<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> correct<00:00:41.070> one<00:00:41.340> here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it does have it on the correct one here

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
it does have it on the correct one here
it<00:00:42.450> does<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.649> obviously

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it does have it on here but obviously

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.970 
it does have it on here but obviously
you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> difference<00:00:44.940> here

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
you can see the difference here

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.250 
you can see the difference here
drastically<00:00:47.510> look<00:00:48.510> how<00:00:48.629> much<00:00:48.750> thicker<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
drastically look how much thicker this

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
drastically look how much thicker this
one<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.940> way<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.719> is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
one here is in the way this one here is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.279 
one here is in the way this one here is
this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> three<00:00:53.280> pieces<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.750> would

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this is in three pieces now so I would

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.290 
this is in three pieces now so I would
have<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> say<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.980> uh<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.850> good<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.120> any

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
have to say it's uh it's not good or any

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.830 
have to say it's uh it's not good or any
more<00:01:00.480> oh<00:01:00.690> maybe<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.250> statement<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.390> make

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
more oh maybe my first statement to make

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.410 
more oh maybe my first statement to make
so<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> process<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.360> much

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so in the process it was just so much

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
so in the process it was just so much
easier<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:08.040> couldn't<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.180> order<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.460> shock

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
easier I couldn't in order to the shock

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
easier I couldn't in order to the shock
was<00:01:11.909> mounted<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:13.439> order<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> get

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
was mounted right here in order to get

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.520 
was mounted right here in order to get
it<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.760> such<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> pain<00:01:15.299> try<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it out it was such a pain try and get it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
it out it was such a pain try and get it
underneath<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> ended<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.810> taking<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
underneath so I ended up just taking it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.730 
underneath so I ended up just taking it
out<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.810> once<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
out and once I got it out here on the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.200 
out and once I got it out here on the
ground<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.189> was<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.610> easier<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:23.970> me

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
ground it was a little bit easier for me

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
ground it was a little bit easier for me
to<00:01:24.240> try<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.659> get<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.930> unfortunately<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to try and get out unfortunately in the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.429 
to try and get out unfortunately in the
process<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:28.770> don't<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:30.049> that's<00:01:31.049> supposed<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
process I don't think that's supposed to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
process I don't think that's supposed to
happen<00:01:31.619> either<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.990> snapped<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.560> bolt<00:01:34.970> which

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
happen either so I snapped a bolt which

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
happen either so I snapped a bolt which
obviously<00:01:36.329> says<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.680> was

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
obviously says that this thing was

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
obviously says that this thing was
pretty<00:01:37.950> rotted<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.640> well<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.810> pretty

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
pretty rotted out as well it's pretty

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.609 
pretty rotted out as well it's pretty
messed<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.290> gotta

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
messed up so it is what it is so I gotta

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.310 
messed up so it is what it is so I gotta
get<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> new<00:01:43.829> bolt<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.460> aside<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
get a new bolt for it aside from that

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.350 
get a new bolt for it aside from that
but<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.579> looks<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.090> here

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
but the way that this looks down here

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.440 
but the way that this looks down here
now<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.869> got<00:01:49.829> it

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
now I got it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.389

there's<00:02:16.760> their<00:02:17.000> line<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:18.080> hooked<00:02:18.590> up<00:02:18.800> for

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
there's their line that hooked up for

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.900 
there's their line that hooked up for
the<00:02:19.240> actually<00:02:20.240> see<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.630> line<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:21.910> there

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
the actually see the line there there

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.090 
the actually see the line there there
but<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.780> see<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.050> sitting<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:24.530> even<00:02:24.920> though

but you see it's sitting so even though
you<00:02:25.880> know<00:02:26.000> these<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.300> all<00:02:26.330> part<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.930> leaf

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
you know these are all part of the leaf

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.670 
you know these are all part of the leaf
itself<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.709> they're<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.610> sitting<00:02:28.850> there<00:02:28.910> and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
itself so they're just sitting there and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the springs do look fine so I think I'm

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.720 
the springs do look fine so I think I'm
just<00:02:32.150> gonna<00:02:32.330> continue<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.050> use<00:02:33.170> those<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.430> once

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730

go<00:02:36.620> get<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> new<00:02:37.630> bolt<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.440> leaf<00:02:40.400> spring

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and then I'll be fine for that point at
