00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.299
 Wood pellets fulfill all characteristics 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.780
 the one from a modern fuel 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.520
 expected economically comfortable 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.770
 environmentally friendly and crisis-proof you 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.900
 will cut wood from sawdust 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.660
 or chemically untreated residual wood 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.789
 produced by truck 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.339
 Raw material already has to start 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.380
 processing as homogeneous as possible in variety 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.599
 and size are also differences in the 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.189
 Moisture content can be negative 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.589
 affect the manufacturing process 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.689
 therefore the wood residues first in 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.070
 a drying plant evenly 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.320
 moisture is removed 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.570
 for this energy- consuming process 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.090
 Ideally, process will waste heat 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.899
 an obvious one 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.449
 Biomass CHP or other 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.280
 used heat sources 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.590
 after an intermediate storage in dry 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.929
 spahn silo get the wood chips in the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.820
 Metal and heavy material separator of you 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.300
 of metal particles and scree pieces 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.730
 exempt 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.190
 crush in connection hammer mill the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.309
 wood residues as long as a homogeneous 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.820
 Mass of up to 6 mm long wood chips 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.970
 created 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.189
 the following conditioner provides 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.740
 by adding water again for 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.240
 a uniform moisture content with it 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.310
 the added moisture 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.060
 can evenly distribute the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.549
 Chips in a mature container 25 to 30 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.560
 minutes of storage in the pellet 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.240
 press are the chips from koller 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.880
 roll through the holes of a 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.790
 rotating ring die pressed through 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.630
 the high pressure and the friction heat 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.180
 liquefy the ones contained in the wood 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.469
 lignin and resins and become im 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.229
 interplay with the rest 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.270
 wood moisture for nature glue for the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.670
 consistent shape and stability of the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.649
 pellets ensures the exit from the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.360
 The pellets are pelletized 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.610
 the desired length is cut off 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.159
 the fresh pellets are now migrating to the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.500
 pellet cooler where you after the countercurrent 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.180
 principle cooled with ambient air and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.729
 thus be rescued 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.409
 in a final processing step 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.350
 The pellets are placed in a sieve plant 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.180
 from abrasion fine share and too large 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.909
 pellets are free and can now 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.259
 be stored 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.149
 Sold pellets are sold before 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.519
 loading into a loading silo 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.020
 transported and scanned again to 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.940
 required by european standards 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.170
 a maximum of one percent 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.330
 comply 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 after that they will be in one with 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.710
 Compressor and down said BlÃ¤se 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 filled truck and kicked 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.060
 the way to the consumer
