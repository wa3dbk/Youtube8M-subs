going for the red hand which means I'm

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.759

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
cold which means I can't run through

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.840

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
course so that's a pretty bad thing to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.910 
course so that's a pretty bad thing to
have<00:01:42.110> on<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:43.630> pvp<00:01:44.630> server<00:01:45.170> with<00:01:45.319> some<00:01:45.470> locks<00:01:45.710> it

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
soft will find a fix for it because I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.050 
soft will find a fix for it because I
don't<00:01:48.350> really<00:01:48.439> feel<00:01:48.740> like<00:01:48.979> getting<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.759> skull
