at the anatomy can we see differences in
the<00:00:38.610> male<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> female<00:00:39.030> brain<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:40.170> answer<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the male and female brain the answer is

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.810 
the male and female brain the answer is
absolutely<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:42.980> male<00:00:43.980> brains<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.400> larger

absolutely not male brains are larger

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
absolutely not male brains are larger
than<00:00:44.940> female<00:00:45.270> brains<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:45.840> about<00:00:46.170> 10<00:00:46.739> or

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
than female brains but only about 10 or

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.490 
than female brains but only about 10 or
12<00:00:46.980> percent<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.060> you<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> had<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
12 percent so you know if you had a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
12 percent so you know if you had a
couple<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.280> steaks<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:50.970> plate<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> would

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
couple of steaks on your plate it would

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060 
couple of steaks on your plate it would
be<00:00:51.570> hard<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.810> tell<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.440> 10<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:52.800> 12

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
something to do with reproduction but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 
something to do with reproduction but

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it's really not clear at this time what

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
we use our brains is influenced by

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.879 
we use our brains is influenced by

creating gender differences that is the
million-dollar<00:01:25.079> question<00:01:25.219> so<00:01:26.219> it's<00:01:26.639> always

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
million-dollar question so it's always

it<00:02:31.120> depends<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:31.629> kind<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.900> memory<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:33.030> like

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
all these sex differences because there

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.420 
all these sex differences because there
are<00:02:36.129> dozens<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.299> sex<00:02:37.569> differences<00:02:38.280> it's<00:02:39.280> a

are dozens of sex differences it's a

are dozens of sex differences it's a
very<00:02:39.610> small<00:02:39.970> effect<00:02:40.329> so<00:02:40.989> women<00:02:41.349> yes<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:42.099> a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
very small effect so women yes have a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.490 
very small effect so women yes have a
little<00:02:42.610> bit<00:02:42.730> better<00:02:42.879> verbal<00:02:43.480> memory<00:02:43.659> than<00:02:44.230> men

what<00:02:45.220> about<00:02:45.459> math<00:02:45.760> did<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.390> male's<00:02:46.659> win<00:02:46.959> this

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
what about math did the male's win this

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.380 
what about math did the male's win this
round<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:48.159> stereotype<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.909> that<00:02:48.939> men<00:02:49.239> are

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
round the stereotype is that men are

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.930 
round the stereotype is that men are
better<00:02:49.540> at<00:02:49.629> math<00:02:49.930> but<00:02:50.260> average<00:02:50.950> performance

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
better at math but average performance

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.199 
better at math but average performance
there<00:02:52.540> is<00:02:52.659> no<00:02:52.870> difference<00:02:53.440> anymore<00:02:53.769> between

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
there is no difference anymore between

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
highschool girls and boys in math

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.149

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
performance

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.979

well<00:02:57.280> what<00:02:57.430> about<00:02:57.549> sex<00:02:57.909> and<00:02:58.090> relationships<00:02:58.659> is

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
well what about sex and relationships is

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.809 
well what about sex and relationships is
that<00:02:59.109> hardwired<00:02:59.829> in<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.129> sense<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.579> women

course<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:04.060> stereotype<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.750> they<00:03:05.079> do

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
course the stereotype is that they do

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.440 
course the stereotype is that they do
that<00:03:05.709> women<00:03:05.950> want<00:03:06.280> commitment<00:03:06.639> and<00:03:07.030> men<00:03:07.209> want

that women want commitment and men want
casual<00:03:08.109> sex<00:03:08.409> but<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:10.200> think<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.319> reality<00:03:11.500> is

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
casual sex but I think the reality is

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.979 
casual sex but I think the reality is
quite<00:03:12.069> different<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:13.269> judging<00:03:13.540> by<00:03:13.690> what

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
quite different and just judging by what

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.809 
quite different and just judging by what
people<00:03:14.139> are<00:03:14.379> looking<00:03:14.709> for<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.099> mate<00:03:15.370> there

was<00:03:15.909> a<00:03:15.940> large<00:03:16.329> international<00:03:17.079> study<00:03:17.819> that

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
was a large international study that

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.330 
was a large international study that
asked<00:03:19.450> young<00:03:20.019> adults<00:03:20.290> what<00:03:20.980> their<00:03:21.129> top

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
asked young adults what their top

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.420 
asked young adults what their top
criteria<00:03:22.030> were<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.449> almost<00:03:23.349> all<00:03:23.560> both<00:03:24.069> males

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
criteria were and almost all both males

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.640 
criteria were and almost all both males
and<00:03:24.579> females<00:03:24.669> put<00:03:25.500> kindness<00:03:26.500> and

and females put kindness and

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
and females put kindness and
intelligence<00:03:27.280> at<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.459> top<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:27.970> list<00:03:28.180> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
intelligence at the top of the list and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.629 
intelligence at the top of the list and
attractiveness<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:31.379> most<00:03:32.379> people<00:03:32.889> do<00:03:33.280> want<00:03:33.489> a

attractiveness so most people do want a

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.250

long-term committed relationship and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.750 
long-term committed relationship and
they're<00:03:35.410> looking<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.919> same<00:03:36.129> qualities

seems<00:03:37.389> like<00:03:37.599> we're<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.810> not<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.199> different

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
seems like we're just not that different

you<00:03:39.819> can<00:03:39.970> see<00:03:40.180> we're<00:03:40.359> pretty<00:03:40.629> complex

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
you can see we're pretty complex

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.199 
you can see we're pretty complex
creatures<00:03:41.680> especially<00:03:42.250> when<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.910> comes<00:03:43.060> to

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209
