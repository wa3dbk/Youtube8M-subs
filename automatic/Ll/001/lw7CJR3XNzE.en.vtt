do<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:05.010> year<00:01:05.220> spring<00:01:05.549> practices

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
do you think this year spring practices

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
do you think this year spring practices
were<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.479> beneficial<00:01:06.840> for<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> yes<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
were really beneficial for you yes I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.980 
were really beneficial for you yes I
think<00:01:08.280> they're<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:08.420> especially<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.570> we

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
think they're very especially with we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
think they're very especially with we
got<00:01:10.110> coach<00:01:10.350> Gibbs<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> defensive

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
got coach Gibbs and the defensive

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
got coach Gibbs and the defensive
defense<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.570> more<00:01:12.840> turnover<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.500> we're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
defense got some more turnover and we're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
defense got some more turnover and we're
about<00:01:14.010> cutting<00:01:14.490> turnovers<00:01:14.820> down<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> think

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
about cutting turnovers down I think

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
about cutting turnovers down I think
it's<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.320> helped<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.130> they

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's that helped out a lot because they

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's that helped out a lot because they
were<00:01:17.369> trying<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:17.790> turnovers<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.390> were

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
were trying to get turnovers and we were

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.820 
were trying to get turnovers and we were
trying<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> cut<00:01:18.900> down<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.170> same<00:01:19.350> time<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
trying to cut down at the same time and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.580 
trying to cut down at the same time and
it<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.040> create<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> great<00:01:20.580> competition<00:01:21.590> do

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and I could probably take an hour on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
and I could probably take an hour on
this<00:01:39.360> alone<00:01:39.600> briefly<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.380> guess<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.950> talk

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this alone briefly I guess can I talk

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.740 
this alone briefly I guess can I talk
about<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.610> takes<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.000> Cerebral<00:01:42.479> part<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

the<00:01:42.840> game<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.110> playing<00:01:43.259> quarterback<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the game of playing quarterback is

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.780 
the game of playing quarterback is
obviously<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> most<00:01:44.430> underrated

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
obviously one of the most underrated

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
obviously one of the most underrated
parts<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.659> reroll<00:01:46.170> processing<00:01:46.950> everything

parts this reroll processing everything

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.190 
parts this reroll processing everything
like<00:01:47.460> okay<00:01:48.149> what's<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.540> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> entail<00:01:48.990> how

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
like okay what's that kind of entail how

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.660 
like okay what's that kind of entail how
difficult<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.369> quarterback

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
difficult is that for a new quarterback

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.749 
difficult is that for a new quarterback
to<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.149> take<00:01:51.299> over<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.600> program<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.759> mean

to kind of take over a program I mean
this<00:01:53.939> that's<00:01:54.570> probably<00:01:55.200> biggest<00:01:55.380> part<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
this that's probably biggest part of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.109 
this that's probably biggest part of
being<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> quarterback<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.549> mean<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.090> have

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
to watch film you have to know what the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.649 
to watch film you have to know what the
defenders<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.729> doing<00:01:59.909> before<00:02:00.060> they're<00:02:00.390> doing

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659

this all around I know being a
quarterback<00:04:52.380> I<00:04:52.590> was<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.860> mean<00:04:53.070> last<00:04:53.250> year<00:04:53.460> I
