no cupcake man with a cupcake title oh
yeah<00:03:37.720> that's<00:03:37.959> what<00:03:38.109> I<00:03:38.170> was<00:03:38.319> saying<00:03:38.470> they<00:03:39.099> threw

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
yeah that's what I was saying they threw

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.629 
yeah that's what I was saying they threw
the<00:03:39.609> stun<00:03:39.819> grenade<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.359> then<00:03:40.599> I<00:03:40.870> immediately

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
the stun grenade and then I immediately

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.710 
the stun grenade and then I immediately
recognized<00:03:42.639> that<00:03:42.760> he<00:03:42.940> was<00:03:43.030> gonna<00:03:43.150> run<00:03:43.359> out<00:03:43.540> and

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
recognized that he was gonna run out and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.390 
recognized that he was gonna run out and
try<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.900> try<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.319> get<00:03:44.560> me<00:03:44.709> real<00:03:44.889> quick<00:03:45.099> but<00:03:45.250> it

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
try to try to get me real quick but it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.009 
try to try to get me real quick but it
didn't<00:03:45.639> work<00:03:45.849> now<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.420> he<00:03:46.660> were<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.840> use<00:03:46.989> a

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
didn't work now if he were to use a

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.110 
didn't work now if he were to use a
flashbang<00:03:47.799> then<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.370> probably<00:03:48.790> would<00:03:49.030> have

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
flashbang then I probably would have

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.520 
flashbang then I probably would have
died<00:03:49.299> but<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.750> disadvantage<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.470> using

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
died but the disadvantage of using

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.220 
died but the disadvantage of using
flashbang<00:03:51.310> it's<00:03:51.489> obviously<00:03:51.910> house<00:03:52.569> yeah<00:03:53.019> my

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
flashbang it's obviously house yeah my

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.680 
flashbang it's obviously house yeah my
face<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.859> obviously<00:03:54.730> how<00:03:54.910> slowly<00:03:55.239> thrown

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
face is obviously how slowly thrown

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.479 
face is obviously how slowly thrown
that's<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.290> reason<00:03:56.500> why<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> don't<00:03:57.040> use<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.250> and

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
that's the reason why I don't use it and

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.039 
that's the reason why I don't use it and
sometimes<00:03:57.700> like<00:03:58.419> you<00:03:58.510> thought<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.780> get<00:03:58.959> the

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
sometimes like you thought you get the

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.629 
sometimes like you thought you get the
flashbang<00:03:59.530> right<00:03:59.769> and<00:03:59.980> then<00:04:00.099> you<00:04:00.220> throw<00:04:00.459> it

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
flashbang right and then you throw it

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.120 
flashbang right and then you throw it
you<00:04:00.849> threw<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.810> like<00:04:01.870> 40<00:04:02.260> feet<00:04:02.530> away<00:04:02.650> from<00:04:02.829> you

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
you threw it like 40 feet away from you

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.610 
you threw it like 40 feet away from you
and<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.730> still<00:04:03.910> blind<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.780> like<00:04:04.959> dig

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
and it's still blind you so you like dig

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.080 
and it's still blind you so you like dig
what<00:04:05.889> is<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.160> point<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.579> even<00:04:06.669> using

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
what is the point of even using

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.000 
what is the point of even using
flashbangs<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.169> what<00:04:08.319> is<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.560> point<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.889> that

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
flashbangs of what is the point of that

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.979 
flashbangs of what is the point of that
you<00:04:09.099> still<00:04:09.310> blind<00:04:09.579> yourself<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:10.209> as<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:10.810> see

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
you still blind yourself and as you see

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.479 
you still blind yourself and as you see
right<00:04:11.019> there<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.410> skipped<00:04:11.799> that<00:04:11.889> part<00:04:11.980> because

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
right there I skipped that part because

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.039 
right there I skipped that part because
it<00:04:12.669> took<00:04:12.790> about<00:04:13.030> two<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.480> half<00:04:13.510> hours<00:04:13.930> for
