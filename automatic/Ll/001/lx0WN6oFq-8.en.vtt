 raccoon dogs of which I invite you to 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.790
 know a little 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 of course they are wild animals many people 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 think it's something like a cross 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.900
 between dog and raccoon is not a kind 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.520
 wild little seen in our country 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.520
 because it is an Asian spice 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.570
 in which we live 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.420
 although they were baptized like this in Mexico 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.970
 they do not even have the character of the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.790
 dogs although their anatomy is not fooling 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.220
 they are called also so they never get to 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.890

 from his dad and his mom that the truth is 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.180
 that they take good care of them and also emit 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.440
 sounds that resemble those 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.440
 barking of a small dog 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.900
