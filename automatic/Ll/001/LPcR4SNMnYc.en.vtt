I've<00:01:46.490> got<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> legal<00:01:47.630> question<00:01:47.960> please<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:49.909> are

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
I've got a legal question please you are

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.630 
I've got a legal question please you are
you<00:01:50.420> said<00:01:50.659> it's<00:01:51.469> about<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.950> front<00:01:52.340> assist

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
you said it's about the front assist

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.990 
you said it's about the front assist
system<00:01:53.170> what<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.470> maximum<00:01:54.890> speed<00:01:55.009> warrior

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
system what is the maximum speed warrior

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.620 
system what is the maximum speed warrior
react<00:01:56.680> basically<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.820> challenge<00:01:59.329> for<00:01:59.570> a

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
react basically the the challenge for a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.260 
react basically the the challenge for a
radar-based<00:02:00.500> system<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.340> not<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.759> top<00:02:01.939> speed

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
radar-based system is not the top speed

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.270 
radar-based system is not the top speed
it's<00:02:02.479> always<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.049> lower<00:02:03.200> speed<00:02:03.590> because<00:02:03.979> then

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's always the lower speed because then

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.179 
it's always the lower speed because then
you<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:05.030> challenge<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:06.439> distance<00:02:06.890> gets

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
you have the challenge the distance gets

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.790 
you have the challenge the distance gets
very<00:02:07.399> small<00:02:07.880> but<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.660> system<00:02:09.110> goes<00:02:09.319> down<00:02:09.349> to

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
very small but this system goes down to

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.309 
very small but this system goes down to
zero<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.310> if<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.120> follow<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.510> car<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.959> stops

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
zero so if you follow a car it stops

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.530 
zero so if you follow a car it stops
this<00:02:12.650> car<00:02:12.920> will<00:02:13.099> also<00:02:13.519> stop

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.679 

with<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.349> google<00:02:18.709> hang<00:02:19.069> out<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:20.239> get<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> very
