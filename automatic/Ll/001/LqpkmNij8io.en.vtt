titles<00:01:12.160> we're<00:01:13.160> still<00:01:13.370> working<00:01:13.460> on<00:01:13.730> that<00:01:13.760> we're

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
titles we're still working on that we're

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.880

we're<00:01:14.750> planning<00:01:15.230> to<00:01:15.260> bring<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.560> out<00:01:15.740> around

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
we're planning to bring this out around

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.940 
we're planning to bring this out around
summer<00:01:16.190> 2008<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.810> at<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.320> time<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:18.800> look

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
summer 2008 so at that time we look

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.360 
summer 2008 so at that time we look
forward<00:01:19.190> to<00:01:20.530> supporting<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.010> great<00:01:22.250> deal

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
forward to supporting this a great deal

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.760 
forward to supporting this a great deal
so<00:01:22.970> obviously<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.600> ps3<00:01:24.110> has<00:01:24.260> an<00:01:24.410> Ethernet

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
so obviously the ps3 has an Ethernet

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.020 
so obviously the ps3 has an Ethernet
port<00:01:24.979> in<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.100> back<00:01:25.160> so<00:01:25.460> that<00:01:25.490> shouldn't<00:01:25.910> be

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
port in the back so that shouldn't be

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.460 
port in the back so that shouldn't be
too<00:01:26.060> hard<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.450> update<00:01:26.600> by<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.080> firmware

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
too hard to update by a firmware

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.710 
too hard to update by a firmware
something<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.550> that<00:01:28.580> nature<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.300> how<00:01:29.660> many

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
something of that nature but how many

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.210 
something of that nature but how many
different<00:01:30.140> players<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.500> going<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:30.920> and
