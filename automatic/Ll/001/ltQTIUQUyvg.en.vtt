00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.780
 from time immemorial marussia build 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.270
 wooden houses 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.060
 good burned the strength we never had 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.059
 problems but today in the era 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.450
 cutting-edge technology and 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.690
 materials of interest given house building 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.490
 very high in stats 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.940
 construction market more than 40% per cent 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.560
 private low-rise residential buildings 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.720
 built of wood 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080
 in the top three market lose that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.039
 built and plant such Kalinovo 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.040
 profiled bar 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.130
 So 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.390
 let time profiled timber 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.550
 this is the building material of the latter 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.310
 generations 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.820
 it is made on the basis of new technologies 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.270
 in woodworking 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.860
 ten years ago, glued laminated timber was delivered 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.140
 to russia from abroad mainly 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.240
 decade now do it kis 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.790
 unstitched in the far east 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.230
 Ronaldo growth portfolios state 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.930
 you can build anything 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.280
 when 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.460
 I would recommend residential more 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.060
 premises stas strict on the test 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.450
 profiled bar Igor Sopov 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.650
 professional builder 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.930
 the specialists 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.800
 on northern housing construction 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.880
 has experience working with wood more 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.660
 fifteen years and is counting each 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.640
 your home is ahead or otherwise already 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.270
 70th 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.250
 reset 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.250
 yes all sorts I met countries 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.810
 in construction, I just applied 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.230
 ordinary just us 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.530
 which required shrink time 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.510
 respectively 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.850
 in the window 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.040
 it will give a rating yesterday 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.630
 but at the moment I think that 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.370
 Inna profiled beam 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.800
 but is the best option 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.120
 we take construction for surveillance timber 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.360
 special is used 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.060
 water resistant and as claimed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.970
 environmentally friendly manufacturers 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.950
 colleagues 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.240
 that does not interfere with wood usa 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090
 with the reversal of the future timber 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.060
 rejected stacked each 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.040
 friend with the opposite 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.540
 the direction of the wood chills behind 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.229
 an account of this is achieved 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.250
 increased strength of glued laminated timber 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.739
 versus whole 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.930
 The number in America can be from three to six 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.090
 units and machined connections 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 on the principle shot so 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.299
 rigidly binds each beam higher and 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.829
 below lying in some cases when 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.399
 construction does not need to condense 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.039
 they say I understand the tours 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.829
 already essentially saying here and at the output of the crack 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:32.639
 which 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.299
 not having gaps 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.900
 the old type is literally one 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.189
 sad 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.159
 as a result of this century 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.829
 percentage shoot off 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:42.669
 editions 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.759
 as all the details of the future home from 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.359
 glued profiled 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.489
 Beams are made with 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.990
 high precision in the factory 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.170
 construction site 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.870
 produced the bill and the timing in particular here 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.049
 this house 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.669
 gold volume 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.210
 Rostov on Don meters 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.210
 lumber tried the brigade 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.559
 up to six people 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.559
 yes we disconnect the author 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.719
 do we have an answer using a crane in 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.399
 within twenty two business days by 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.429
 the article says the document 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:15.279
 salmon weekend 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.609
 worked in a different way 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.919
 apparatus dollars of the strongest that is 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.469
 full time work day 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.969
 financial monsters 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.909
 telecommunications particular in the field 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.999
 intelligence 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.039
 percentage held 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:29.929
 currents up 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.669
 here together as you will see here the drugs 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.489
 is known 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.689
 third place was shot 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.700
 answered here if it does not create problems 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.189
 does not require additional 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.859
 of view 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.799
 process such as males process 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.579
 people that is 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.529
 of protection 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:48.879
 these boilers here are no hindrances and 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.599
 spoils iphone 3g 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.410
 percent 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.309
 if we are with him in 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:54.680
 in the bank is protected 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.389
 this is the most 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.199
 this is the floor 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.199
 Votkinsk side insulation cable itself 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.659
 this table was a fire fire 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.639
 safety is our decent level 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.669
 gait 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.159
 our time is often very much 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.480
 new developing rub 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.409
 In this case, flame retardants before 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.829
 which is left and only then in the same 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.139
 antiseptic time is 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.590
 antipenko percentage he does not give anyone was 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.680
 creating his fire and there is 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.449
 Krylova so that is arbitrary 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.199
 ignition that is 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.270
 what is there 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.440
 let's say in the capital soon what that is 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.289
 it will relieve literally locally of light 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.169
 stay in one place and in 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.089
 concluding a few words on support 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:43.270
 surface of laminated veneer lumber made with 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.589
 compliance with all technological 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:48.139
 requirements smooth and smooth assembled from 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.710
 such a voice wall will be a monolith 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.240
 almost no exterior trim 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.610
 by the way due to the lack of costs for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.620
 the finish is significantly reduced 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.750
 the cost of just thinking built 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.059
 from profiled timber 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.599
 do not require a day Dakota frame 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.430
 what percentage is there 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.850
 warming, therefore, backfilling 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.979
 assets afterwards all this he himself 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.710
 is already 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.979
 frying pans so designer 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.779
 by decision q 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.370
 essentially like 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.199
 however, you can minimize 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.199
 say people can live in it 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.999
 by themselves 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.599
 grandchildren and children and grandchildren and the press 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.939
 up to steel 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.129
 no limit 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.129
 for the good 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.910
 the following program is a business we 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.630
 be sure to tell a 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.460

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.199
 you know a monolithic foam concrete not 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.039
 foam concrete blocks as well as we will introduce 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.289

 building materials if you 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.210
 interesting topic of low-rise 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.770
