00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
him from vaguely around the edge of the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
him from vaguely around the edge of the
box<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.810> why<00:01:22.140> seems<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> go<00:01:22.619> into<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> back

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
box that why seems to go into the back

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
box that why seems to go into the back
of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> net<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:24.030> why<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.270> was

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
of the net I just don't know why it was

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
of the net I just don't know why it was
weird<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.470> he's<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> good<00:01:25.920> shot

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
weird it's not like he's got a good shot

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
weird it's not like he's got a good shot
power<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.700> good<00:01:26.939> long<00:01:27.119> shots<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.810> anything

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
like that really he just he seems to be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.520 
like that really he just he seems to be
able<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> easily<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> back<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
power and pace and accuracy it just goes

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
power and pace and accuracy it just goes

at if you want a good striker but I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.809 
at if you want a good striker but I
really<00:02:22.680> am<00:02:22.860> struggling<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.430> find<00:02:23.549> any

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
really am struggling to find any

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.309 
really am struggling to find any
weaknesses<00:02:24.299> for<00:02:24.360> him<00:02:24.629> I'm<00:02:24.720> sorry<00:02:24.900> trying<00:02:25.230> to

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
weaknesses for him I'm sorry trying to

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.360 
weaknesses for him I'm sorry trying to
think<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.530> anything<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.010> had<00:02:26.190> problems

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
think of anything that I had problems

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.550 
think of anything that I had problems
with<00:02:26.700> him<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.480> genuinely<00:02:27.690> cannot

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
with him and I really genuinely cannot

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.289 
with him and I really genuinely cannot
think<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.890> anything<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.430> he<00:02:29.700> did<00:02:29.879> not<00:02:29.909> do

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
think of anything that he did not do

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.819 
think of anything that he did not do
very<00:02:30.329> well<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.230> guess<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.650> why

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
very well and I guess that's why

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.580 
very well and I guess that's why
justifies<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.840> 180,000<00:02:33.840> coin<00:02:34.019> price<00:02:34.349> tag

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
justifies that 180,000 coin price tag

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.949 
justifies that 180,000 coin price tag
because<00:02:34.769> he<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.879> absolutely<00:02:36.329> spot-on

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
because he is just so absolutely spot-on

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.839 
because he is just so absolutely spot-on
but<00:02:37.620> anyway<00:02:37.920> we're<00:02:38.099> coming<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.459> towards<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
but anyway we're coming up towards the

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.670 
but anyway we're coming up towards the
end<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.120> episode<00:02:39.269> now<00:02:39.659> guys<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.319> if<00:02:40.560> you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
end of this episode now guys so if you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.539 
end of this episode now guys so if you
could<00:02:40.829> leave<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.400> would<00:02:41.489> be

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
could leave a like that would be
