00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 Good evening cooking you want goes today 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.350
 we will prepare coconut protein milk e 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 Raw pistachio hygienist without water 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.160
 the water we will give the plants there 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.899
 you will find that by adopting the regime 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 food hygienist will not hear the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.510
 need to drink water because vi 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 only the organic water taken will suffice 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.010
 with fruits and vegetables 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.480
 the tensions that will come to us are one 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.390
 centrifuge and even better an extractor 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.319
 of juice a colander a bottle opener a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.339
 hammer screwdriver and a blender 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:58.829
 the ingredients are three coconuts and 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:03.350
 unsweetened and unsalted pistachios 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.719
 therefore suitable for hygienist milk 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 so as regards the doses 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:11.729
 100 grams of would be good 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.250
 equivalent pistachios as you see a 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.039
 this half cup if you use 200 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.049
 the important thing is that you proportionate the water 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:27.299
 that we're going to extract from the coconut 1 to 3 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.119
 ratio must be a 3 so if 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.950
 Fill it half cup of pistachios 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.820
 we will use 3 cups half filled with 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.210
 coconut water 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.750
 if we use 200 grams we will fill them 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 cups up to the edge we now pass the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.549
 proceeding as first thing we put in 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.840
 soak the pistachios and we will keep them that way 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.909
 for eight hours 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.950
 therefore it is advisable to do this 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.740
 operation in the evening such that the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.740
 morning we are ready to do the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.990
 milk well we have drained the water of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.200
 soaking pistachios 8 hours have passed 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.289
 they have rehydrated let's put them aside and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:27.720
 let's open the coconuts 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:36.269
 using the bottle opener we extract 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:38.220
 right away the water with a know we should 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.079
 being able to fill still more 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.430
 booked so we took care of the 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.629
 proportion of 100 grams of pistachios and 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.299
 3 coconuts 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.810
 if you want to make 200 grams of pistachios 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:59.579
 it will take six coconuts the three 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:03.120
 I love the coco water and we put it back 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.629
 in the three cups well now that we have 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.400
 extract the coconut juice through 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:14.729
 the piercing of the first eye pierce 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.829
 also a second small eye for splitting 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:19.250
 the coconut because one of the three opposes it 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.250
 resistance 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:35.750
 well now we are ready to split the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:42.320
 coconut some well-aimed blow in the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.390
 cooking point we put inside 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.560
 of the blender container the 100 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:52.850
 grams of pistachios half cup of 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:04:14.320
 gun yes and the three mezze competes by 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:16.970
 coconut water we whisk the whole thing done 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.980
 by itself this is already milk of 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:34.400
 we only have to filter pistachios 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:37.880
 using the strainer the pulp obviously 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.750
 we will use to dress from 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.350
 nice salads or to make veil on I could 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.350
 protein crises 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.740
 well this in itself and milk of 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:58.900
 pistachio we repeat that we used 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:04.040
 coconut juice instead of water 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:07.040
 current that we now intensify the 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.500
 taste of coconut by centrifuging with the 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.550
 body itself 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.230
 cut the coconut into small cubes 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.560
 facilitate the work of the centrifuge 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:22.450
 because anyway being very hard 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.640
 home appliance fatigue a little bit 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.640
 compared to the other fruit 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.070
 well let's start to spin the cubes of 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:44.640
 coco we take a few few at work 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:48.260
 between this fact we should have obtained 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.260
 a glass of coconut milk 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.430
 now we're going to combine the art of pisa with whom 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:04.230
 with coconut milk goalkeeper milk 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:09.570
 of pistachios of course if you prefer 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:12.800
 you can also have it this way ie without 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.600
 mix it with the other glass of 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.100
 coconut milk 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:24.870
 but so the gus is definitely more 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:27.510
 particular but the congo you can 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.600
 throw if you only make milk from 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.900
 natural pistachio anyway to do 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.380
 hygienist milk necessarily serve 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.810
 3 non cini konko to take the juice 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.430
 in the right proportion put down milk of 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.300
 stand without using water 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:57.580
 paola we can strike and mix 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:07:01.470
 we will evaluate well with the doses you have 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.940
 we gave come two glasses 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.080
 plenty of coconut milk from 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.050
 pistachios 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.120
 the important thing is to keep the milk in 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.830
 a glass bottle tightly 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.580
 closed better is consuming the first 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.970
 possible 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.860
 otherwise it resists 12 days in the fridge 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.290
 I would keep more in this case because the 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.080
 coconut oxidizes very easily e 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:29.640
 quickly good cooking evolved there 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.640
 all to the next video recipe 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.319
