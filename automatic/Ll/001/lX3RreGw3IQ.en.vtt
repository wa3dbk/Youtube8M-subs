now what do you learn show me what to
you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.619> live<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.980> their<00:00:32.790> accurate<00:00:33.270> IQ<00:00:33.570> these

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
you can live out their accurate IQ these

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.630 
you can live out their accurate IQ these
aureus<00:00:34.230> which<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:34.980> show<00:00:35.520> me

aureus which one do you like show me
each<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.540> cells<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.690> read

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
each one all about cells so you can read

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.729 
each one all about cells so you can read
about<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.610> what's<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.730> 20<00:00:57.739> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
about it right what's this 20 it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
about it right what's this 20 it's
different<00:00:59.070> sections<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.579> cards<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
different sections like cards so the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
different sections like cards so the
graphics<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.710> pretty<00:01:01.770> good<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.280> next
