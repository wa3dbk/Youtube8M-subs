00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.910
 acknowledge that we have all done something that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.770
 another misdemeanor in the videogames their 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.750
 wide possibilities allow us such 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.250
 degree of freedom that good is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.349
 inevitable that arises in some 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.119
 situations for example you remember 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.070
 when they invited us to destroy a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 entire city with a nuclear bomb in 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.690
 fallout 3 we lost many missions and 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.489
 characters but the button was there 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.489
 I was there and of course 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.420
 thank goodness then we could load a 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.520
 previous game and this imp that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.080
 we all have been living in our 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.090
 interior since the beginning of our 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.950
 stage as players since we hit 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.470
 the second player's button on a 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.330
 recreational machine without wanting to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.250
 give us a credit for the expensive at cost 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.140
 of our friend but in the solitude of 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.810
 our rooms we have done things 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.240
 that you would not believe we have seen 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.370
 entire civilizations burn alone because 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.750
 we wanted and taxes all 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.190
 we know how to fix the world in 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.229
 twitter but they put us a game of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.450
 management in front and the only thing that we know 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.220
 is to raise the damn taxes that 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.410
 when we are not kings as in cluj 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.509
 shader kings where we cut more heads 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.800
 and we commit more inbreeding than all 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.800
 Game of Thrones characters 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.630
 obsolete the tricks of all 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 the life that fun had to go through 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.500
 walls or make giant heads 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 the characters putting a simple code 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.310
 it was much more entertaining to experience 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.810
 with the possibilities of the game can 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.850
 let it be simple curiosity what we 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.229
 lead to doing these outrages but it was 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 your curiosity the one that ended 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.189
 countless sims in the pool when 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.380
 They took the ladder the poor 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.179
 the sandwiches were urinated in the water 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.789
 in a room more tiny than a 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.479
 zulo and they call it life simulator more 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.479
 well of death 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.519
 there are many titles where our 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.439
 moral decisions are the basis of the game 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.480
 but who wants to get some 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.219
 horns on your head like on facebook or 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.469
 that cracks in his face as in more and 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.870
 fec is better to do all kinds of vileness 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.640
 without the need for a karmic system that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.260
 it's so the day before yesterday there's no color with 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.030
 be able to run over whoever you want and how 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.859
 want just because you can 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.750
 do it and that is that since the physical 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.010
 came into play the world is a place 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.010
 much more fun 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.829
 do not believe that we are the players 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.810
 unique that we participate in this ritual 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.489
 of chaos and destruction are sometimes the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.329
 own developers those that we 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.030
 put in tray 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.890
 games like carmagedÃ³n or postal 2 are 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.900
 there for us to do the goat go 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.560
 simulator is also there so that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.560
 let's make the goat 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.570
 and then there is the opposite case with 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.850
 games like the recent to last there 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.740
 five in which in its pc version the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.720
 own team ninja warned the modders 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.190
 that they did not strip their girls 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.620
 which were by it to the mind 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.910
 dressed clear or they would not get more 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.400
 deliveries on computers 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.530
 guess what happened is actor is not 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.420
 it took not even 24 hours to discover that 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.420
 there was under those tiny bikinis 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.010
 if the offline game has given us many 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.080
 adventures the hello is not directly a 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.270
 war camp there are carpe 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.990
 diem as reads roy jenkins and his famous 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.990
 war cry 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.849
 that ruined hours and hours of 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.500
 planning and why settle for 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.720
 kill a player in a shooter if 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.280
 you can good rub it on your face 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.140
 there are many classics 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.120
 the player who gets bored and kills you 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.680
 more start a game or the one that knows 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.720
 that will not win and goes around the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.340
 circuit to collide with you you have to 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.920
 recognize that we were original in the 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.810
 90 now games like dark souls come 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.560
 already with included tricks 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.560
 for the online 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.470
 sometimes it's not that we want to be bad is 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.480
 that the world has made us like this this war 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.569
 of mind is a game where even steal 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.770
 beyond the need the thing but if 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.660
 you have no shame 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.090
 you can rob this couple of 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.100
 adorable little old people total then you 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.690
 they commit suicide and that's it but nothing is 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.940
 comparable with the moments of need 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.650
 we spent in an elder scrolls where 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.050
 our enemies will literally be 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.150
 our particular clothing store a 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.150
 what would happen if 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.740
 yes 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.560
 so we surrender to the evidence 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.389
 the players sometimes we release our 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.039
 crueler side without needing us 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.409
 put a good answer and another bad 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.270
 it's not that we are bad people is that 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.129
 we are curious by nature as 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.199
 when you did sexual posturing with 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.759
 your neighbor's dolls or they broke them 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.590
 legs to your sister's barby 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.849
 because with video games it 's the same 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.849
 just that with better graphics
