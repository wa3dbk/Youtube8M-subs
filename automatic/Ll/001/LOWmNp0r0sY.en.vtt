00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.639
 The talk is to talk and tell you it 's from 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.209
 ball 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.550
 speaks here there is the one in the new day 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.810
 today I would like to give some tips here 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.260
 for you 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.740
 It's okay to pass some tips on how to 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.320
 to play slope in codes says what 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.730
 basically applies also to other 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.140
 cuts what you will see here 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.100
 likely to help in 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.120
 others games 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:38.200
 good if you also have background is yes a 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.200
 flu and fainted playing with rs 115 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.239
 which in my opinion in my opinion is 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.070
 the best time of the code but how I 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.340
 said will give the taste of each one and you 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.530
 can use either she or you or even the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.510
 links or see ks 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.040
 even maverick is for those who have the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.180
 sound good piece that even team use in 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.579
 nights 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.920
 You can use it as I use it in my 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.060
 opinion is very good you should also 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.670
 use the chrome coating to stay 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.520
 there in the accessory 11 or 12 thousand 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.530
 investment of what you use in the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.880
 pipe has the muffler and a coating 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.470
 Chrome use because it will increase the owner 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.470
 of the bullet and the power with which it 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.570
 your gun so you really have chance 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.990
 not accept this marketing kill the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.180
 target with the first shot then really 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.310
 It indicates to you use another tactic and 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.250
 also that I also use what I 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.030
 I also advise is obvious is the drill 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.490
 armor the name even jade is the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.729
 piercing certain parts of the map 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.560
 wall something like that and I use 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.810
 because sometimes the guy he is in the network 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.330
 glitch you hit the shot will he 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.729
 die, run away anyway 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.270
 use this or if you do not use the 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.009
 large loaders that nothing else is 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.079
 to get you started with another 50 percent 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.799
 your full increases your pet a little 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.509
 bullets 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.220
 It's good for you, it was not much of a shot either. 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.299
 And you have more bullet the chances of 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.520
 hit the target 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.530
 good beauty 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.200
 secondary you can use what you 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.500
 I want you to use some 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 pistol né to be able to kill the face case 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.900
 You 're the 800th retreat, I'm already magnus. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.620
 Like I said you choose the one you use. 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.540
 there it will be of interest to you 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.980
 the secondary satellite also in 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.290
 no touch passed me is more place 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.450
 for my pecs but you know you 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.240
 choose lethal 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.460
 I advise you to use the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.080
 throw because the throwing knife 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.280
 Are you different with the guy? 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.780
 A crazy man gave you the first shot. 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.850
 difference but missed 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.250
 Do you still have a chance to push rb is? 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.650
 play knife in the office and kill him 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.350
 rb the platform-specific button that 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.000
 you're playing you can accept the knife 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.460
 good stuff too 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.840
 you can also use c4 né that works 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.230
 more or less of the same scheme only 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.380
 with a little more delay and the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.450
 the fragmentation grenade and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.980
 Anything you do there 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.300
 they want to be interested because like me 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.200
 said these parts so it does not matter 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.890
 very 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.760
 it is more advantage to snip the tactic of 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.070
 it matters 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
 so that's where it gets its due 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.280
 liked the choice you want 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.470
 as well as tactical 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.510
 I do not use tactical in steps like myself 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.280
 said more room for the spectrum 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.330
 which in my opinion deserves more 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.850
 highlight because that's what you 're going to do 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.030
 You are you if you play I will play 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.410
 better then go for the advantages 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.250
 well the first assembly that I advise 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.380
 you use it is in the speed part 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.780
 prepared to stay closer 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.790
 ready faster then you run 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.110
 for example he is running beats from the front 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.510
 with the guy if you 're using this 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.040
 only advantage you to take that ball already 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.170
 will leave the country and do not have that time 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.810
 I'm late so I can take the shot. 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.600
 then on such use is very good this 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.610
 you have to use it is something that you do not 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.510
 can not be home or playing snip 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.770
 prepared number two of sleight of hand 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.050
 It's for you to load faster. 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.000
 famous read this network, right? 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.260
 Good how I told you to load more 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.690
 fast if you want 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.860
 I do not know how to play, sorry to say you have 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.660
 to use this also to be able to have more 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.460
 chances to hit your target is yours 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.729
 resist and finished his ammunition 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.770
 Yeah, I also use the marathon. 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.180
 however 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.800
 because the Russian you also in the gameplay 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.819
 I run like a crazy man to 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.129
 everything is on the side 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.500
 I'm not stopped dropping you 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.419
 can use it or if you do not want to play 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.669
 marathon you can use another type of 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:42.099
 thing as it leaves I come here some pec 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.110
 What do you like, two worth talking about? 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.430
 points because this can replace 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.990
 marathon and beauty 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.060
 But this is it going to be a marathon favor 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.180
 you choose whether you want to use it or not 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.039
 now you will have to go handle and use 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.240
 on the way to recharge while 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.699
 you run for example you took a 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.409
 shooting and taking shot is reloading 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.630
 also to kill the guy so you can 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.060
 run away but time comes back and 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.880
 kill a nutcase so it's worth the 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.199
 It's worth using and I also advise now 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.900
 resistance guys 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.849
 You can use and you use it to 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.490
 Regenerate life faster and helps you 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.810
 da fij for those who do not know what day when 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.130
 you kill a certain amount of 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.199
 enemies in sequence 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.960
 help because you 're a defense 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.729
 recovers and can kill face or friend 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.159
 his but the time etc. 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.090
 Use the brakes to help me. 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.430
 damn it 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.930
 but it seems that not enough help and 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.130
 thing you can not forget crazy 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.099
 can not stay like this 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.210
 is the focus of this can not stand serves 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.069
 because at the time did not jump as much as 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.680
 You take a shot and etc. 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.360
 good, that's it, the pecs now 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.729
 attack pack you choose what you 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.520
 want to support flash software I 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:51.759
 I advise support but more of the taste of 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.110
 every one's personal beauty today was this 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.550
 I even wanted to get some good tips. 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.680
 fast and basic to go out to who wants 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.289
 learn to play disney by and hope to have 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.190
 therefore helped them possibly click 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.240
 I did not like it and if possible say it again 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.639
 the favorites to help spread the word 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.389
 Well, that's all. 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.460
 right here 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:12.960
 A beauty, a hug to everyone and until the next 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.960
 video is worth it
