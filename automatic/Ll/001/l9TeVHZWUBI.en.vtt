00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
 how 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.370
 ah 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.760
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.429
 with more watts 4 and once again I bring you 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.810
 another revived in this case the mpx a 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.669
 personal defense weapon available 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.279
 obviously for the engineer class in 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.779
 the lcd draft and many kept me 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.790
 saying good I read some 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.250
 comments better said to bring 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.200
 weapons that do not come with dlc is for the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.090
 style if you want to fix I've done 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.610
 other reviews previously let's say 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.500
 during the year with respect to other 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.570
 weapons that maybe are not from leas are 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.250
 can fix on that but for now I'm going to 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.260
 finish doing those of the dlc is that 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.060
 they're coming out let's say they have a little more 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.560
 of priority for example above all 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.110
 when the east came out very recently 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.610
 but as always I will first start 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.900
 talking about weapon statistics 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.250
 to then be able to talk about 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.770
 everything that was my personal experience 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.170
 with her and the accessories that I recommend 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.239
 to use let's start with statistics 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.820
 as always as you could already see in 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.040
 screen if you want to walk I'll see 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.479
 let's say where are we going to have the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.950
 requirements to unlock this weapon 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.960
 but as they are a few I preferred 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.280
 put it aside because if you do not take me out 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.810
 too much time the video as I would 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.880
 I say will be on screen if they want 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.720
 walk around reading it and can continue with 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.070
 the video 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.800
 and I 'm going to continue with the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.290
 statistics now to start we have 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.360
 a maximum year of 27 a minimum year of 13 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.790
 which begins to fall to 12.5 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.100
 meters and finish descending to 50 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.170
 meters means that 50 meters in 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.480
 forward let's do only 13 damage 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.880
 very but very low a cadence of 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.820
 shot of 850 rounds per minute the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.040
 which travel at 340 meters per second or 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.980
 180 meters per second if you have a 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.130
 equipped silencer is the truth not very 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.979
 recommended and also has a charger 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.330
 of 26 bullets following with the speed 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.190
 of recharging we have a speed of 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.140
 short recharge let's say if we have though 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.080
 be a bullet still in the charger or in 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.970
 the chamber of 2.1 seconds or if we are 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.800
 if we completely emptied the weapon of 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.500
 bullets we have a recharge speed 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.940
 of 27 seconds to finish with the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.270
 statistics we have a setback 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.490
 vertical of 0.36 almost non-existent for 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.590
 the left of 0.3 and for the right of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.600
 0.3 fairly standard with respect to 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.070
 some weapons if of a caliber a little 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.410
 minor or perhaps are not rifles 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.750
 assault with a multiplier of the first 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.200
 2.1 shot a little higher than 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.580
 that we are 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.040
 manned maybe for this kind of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
 smaller weapons let's say but it's not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.660
 nothing that you can not get to say to 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.190
 scare for example because the truth that 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.170
 the recoil is very, very controllable 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.000
 already going on to talk about what was my 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 personal experience with the weapon and my 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.670
 opinion regarding it obviously 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.410
 you may have had a 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.810
 different experience or opinion 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.459
 different also because no but something 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.390
 that called me a lot of attention are 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.790
 the 27 maximum damage combined with the 850 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.310
 rounds per minute which means or 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.099
 that's how I see it allowing us 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.989
 kill someone with 4 shots in a little 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.000
 more of distance than they are 12.5 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.489
 meters we're not going to have to be in that 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.530
 let's say that restricted distance 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.900
 that we have and that if only we 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.650
 we distanced one foot more than 12.5 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.720
 meters 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.459
 we're going to need another shot more to 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.470
 kill our target obviously in 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.060
 close combat a shot does all the 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.190
 let's say if it's something that happens 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.079
 in an instant simply many times 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.400
 we do not even notice but can kill 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.319
 to someone with four shots in what 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.209
 are maybe up to 17 meters I do not have 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.340
 obviously the graph in front of me 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.440
 showing me exactly the distance that 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.450
 let's continue killing someone 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.950
 of four shots but being 27 years old 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.330
 means that although the damage continues 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.490
 falling a little bit more after the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.290
 12.5 meters or start to fall better said 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.880
 let's continue killing someone 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.130
 of 4 shots which is very, very 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.630
 useful is a huge difference especially 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.250
 as I already tell you in close combat in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.140
 which always happens in an instant 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.260
 many times we do not even notice 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.270
 what still happens accessories 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.210
 they called me the one I recommend 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.440
 let's say they are first a point sight 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.090
 red obviously in this case I'm 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.490
 using the reflex is the first 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.830
 is unlocked and can also use 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.900
 an ergonomic to have better aim 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.160
 when it's time to move and shoot something 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.140
 that we 're going to be doing a lot about 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.520
 all because obviously this weapon the 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.160
 I recommend for what is combat 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.230
 near and maybe half distances and 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.850
 Until there, they will not want to be in 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.280
 a too open map that has 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.140
 let's say some lines or zones of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.730
 long distance combat is because 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.650
 is armed loses too much damage and 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.050
 he's also going to lose a lot of marksmanship 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.000
 As I said, it has 13 minimum damage to 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.130
 the 50 meters will not do us any good 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.470
 at long distances basically so 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.480
 look at the red point towards economic and if 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.740
 they want to put you can add 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.229
 let's say a 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.880
 when making a flashlight or a tactical light 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.580
 the truth is that it's not too much 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.099
 necessary the laser sight has a very 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.569
 good marksmanship already in itself the weapon of 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.250
 what is shot from the hip but 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.630
 if you want to put a tactical light 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.860
 which is lit only with being 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.139
 pointing and shutting down automatically 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.729
 when they take it out the truth is that it is a 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.650
 very useful accessory especially for that 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.210
 people who maybe are so used to 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.190
 to learn and to be able to look at it when doing 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.810
 are some of those you can turn on and 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.490
 turn off manually let's say when the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.840
 they need and when not but as always 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.460
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.020
 this review can leave me a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.000
 recommendation of the weapon you want to see 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.409
 soon as I say, they have a 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.699
 little more of priority the weapons of the 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.349
 vélez is that they are dating but always 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.000
 can you leave me your recommendation in the 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.440
 comment section and as always 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.440
 see you next ciao
