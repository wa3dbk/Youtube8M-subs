as<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.040> can<00:01:13.190> see<00:01:13.430> here<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.970> have<00:01:14.450> one<00:01:14.660> by<00:01:14.869> a

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
as you can see here I have one by a

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.500 
as you can see here I have one by a
company<00:01:15.290> called<00:01:15.380> Athena<00:01:16.150> now<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.300> model

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
company called Athena now this model

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.290 
company called Athena now this model
came<00:01:17.780> out<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:17.990> few<00:01:18.229> years<00:01:18.470> ago<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:20.030> actually

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
came out a few years ago and I actually

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.719 
came out a few years ago and I actually
have<00:01:20.660> one<00:01:20.960> that<00:01:20.990> has<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.470> speaker<00:01:22.040> that's<00:01:22.490> kind

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
have one that has a speaker that's kind

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.820 
have one that has a speaker that's kind
of<00:01:22.820> blown<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.170> thought<00:01:24.350> it'd<00:01:24.470> be<00:01:24.530> kind<00:01:24.710> of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
of blown and I thought it'd be kind of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.389 
of blown and I thought it'd be kind of
cool<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.369> do<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.880> output<00:01:26.869> demo<00:01:27.619> on<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.190> see

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
cool to do a output demo on it and see

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.850 
cool to do a output demo on it and see
what<00:01:28.640> kind<00:01:28.790> of<00:01:28.820> power<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.180> puts<00:01:29.360> out<00:01:29.680> so<00:01:30.680> real

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
what kind of power it puts out so real

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.139 
what kind of power it puts out so real
quick<00:01:31.040> I'll<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:31.399> show<00:01:31.580> you<00:01:31.610> I've<00:01:31.790> got<00:01:31.940> two

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
quick I'll just show you I've got two

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.950 
quick I'll just show you I've got two

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
here obviously one is in great condition

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.980 
here obviously one is in great condition
and<00:01:36.110> has<00:01:36.350> no<00:01:36.560> problems<00:01:37.130> just<00:01:37.810> turn<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.930> around

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
and has no problems just turn it around

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.740 
and has no problems just turn it around
and<00:01:39.259> show<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.530> some<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.570> some<00:01:41.570> of<00:01:41.630> the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and show you some of the some of the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.810 
and show you some of the some of the
connections<00:01:42.229> there's<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.500> port<00:01:42.830> here<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
connections there's a port here for the

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.790 
connections there's a port here for the
two<00:01:44.210> speakers<00:01:44.930> I<00:01:45.080> believe<00:01:45.259> there's<00:01:45.440> three

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
two speakers I believe there's three

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.380 
two speakers I believe there's three
inch<00:01:46.039> for<00:01:46.250> three-and-a-half<00:01:46.759> inch<00:01:47.030> as<00:01:47.270> you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
inch for three-and-a-half inch as you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.600 
inch for three-and-a-half inch as you
can<00:01:47.509> see<00:01:47.720> here<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.619> metal<00:01:48.920> grille<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.280> taken

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
can see here the metal grille is taken

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.650 
can see here the metal grille is taken
off<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.880> front<00:01:50.090> of<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.300> one<00:01:50.680> and<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.890> has<00:01:51.920> a

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
off the front of this one and it has a

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.859 
off the front of this one and it has a
3.5<00:01:53.660> input<00:01:55.960> USB<00:01:56.960> which<00:01:58.330> gets<00:01:59.330> us<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.630> make<00:01:59.780> it

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
3.5 input USB which gets us to make it

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.419 
3.5 input USB which gets us to make it
an<00:01:59.959> audio<00:02:00.200> device<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.740> computer<00:02:01.099> I<00:02:01.130> can't

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
an audio device on the computer I can't

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.600 
an audio device on the computer I can't
really<00:02:01.610> remember<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:03.649> yellow<00:02:04.340> one<00:02:04.580> is

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
really remember and the yellow one is

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.040 
really remember and the yellow one is
for<00:02:05.149> video<00:02:05.899> out<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.590> only<00:02:06.679> works<00:02:06.830> with<00:02:07.280> the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
for video out but it only works with the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.440 
for video out but it only works with the
the<00:02:09.050> old<00:02:09.229> iPod<00:02:09.619> videos<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.700> not<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.060> new<00:02:11.209> ones

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
the old iPod videos so not the new ones

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.360 
the old iPod videos so not the new ones
and<00:02:12.230> I'll<00:02:12.349> show<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.650> what<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:12.830> did<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.069> this

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and I'll show you what I did with this

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.110 
and I'll show you what I did with this
one<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:15.130> I've<00:02:16.130> got<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.640> could<00:02:16.819> pull<00:02:17.000> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
one and I've got it so I could pull it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.520 
one and I've got it so I could pull it
apart<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:19.810> that's<00:02:20.810> why<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:20.959> had<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.140> pry<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
apart and that's why I had to pry the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.280 
apart and that's why I had to pry the
the<00:02:22.040> front<00:02:22.250> off<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.420> there's<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the front off so you can see there's the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.990 
the front off so you can see there's the
amplifier<00:02:24.770> down<00:02:25.010> there<00:02:25.160> at<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> bottom<00:02:25.340> with

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
amplifier down there at the bottom with

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.360 
amplifier down there at the bottom with
some<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.330> other<00:02:26.450> electronics<00:02:27.250> there's<00:02:28.250> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
some of the other electronics there's a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.580 
some of the other electronics there's a
little<00:02:28.670> speakers<00:02:29.480> with<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> neodymium

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
little speakers with the neodymium

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.500 
little speakers with the neodymium
magnet<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.360> what<00:02:32.420> I'm

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
magnet on it there it is so what I'm

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.420 
magnet on it there it is so what I'm
gonna<00:02:32.599> do<00:02:32.750> first<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.410> gonna<00:02:33.560> test<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
gonna do first is I'm gonna test the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.010 
gonna do first is I'm gonna test the
impedance<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> speaker's<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.840> see

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
impedance of the speaker's here and see

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.540 
impedance of the speaker's here and see
what<00:02:36.170> kind<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.500> ohm<00:02:36.709> load<00:02:36.950> they're<00:02:37.160> putting<00:02:37.459> on

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
what kind of ohm load they're putting on

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.040 
what kind of ohm load they're putting on
guessing<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:38.180> somewhere<00:02:38.450> between<00:02:38.510> four<00:02:39.020> and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
guessing it's somewhere between four and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.920 
guessing it's somewhere between four and
eight<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.620> we'll<00:02:40.550> find<00:02:40.760> out<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.300> before<00:02:41.599> I<00:02:41.810> do

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
eight but we'll find out but before I do

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.240 
eight but we'll find out but before I do
that<00:02:42.050> I<00:02:42.260> was<00:02:42.380> gonna<00:02:42.470> let<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:42.650> listen<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.160> it

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
that I was gonna let you listen to it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.819 
that I was gonna let you listen to it
real<00:02:43.430> quick

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.110 

you<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:52.950> probably<00:02:53.219> hear<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.609> distorted

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you can probably hear the distorted

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:08.210 
you can probably hear the distorted
speaker<00:02:54.359> which<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.170> right

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 

okay<00:03:08.670> what<00:03:08.849> I've<00:03:08.940> done<00:03:09.090> here<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.420> I've<00:03:09.660> hooked

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
okay what I've done here is I've hooked

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.559 
okay what I've done here is I've hooked
up<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.319> good<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.849> because<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.420> doesn't

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
up the good one just because it doesn't

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.059 
up the good one just because it doesn't
make<00:03:12.750> any<00:03:12.900> sense<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.260> let<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> listen<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
make any sense to let you listen to the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.339 
make any sense to let you listen to the
one<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.370> sounds<00:03:14.700> bad<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.090> distorted<00:03:15.540> just

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
one that sounds bad and distorted just

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.070 
one that sounds bad and distorted just
give<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.620> an<00:03:16.709> idea<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:17.040> how<00:03:17.190> good<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:18.080> this

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
give you an idea of how good this this

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.010 
give you an idea of how good this this
duck<00:03:19.950> sounds<00:03:20.430> now<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.030> rated<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.569> believe<00:03:21.810> if

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
duck sounds now it is rated I believe if

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.350 
duck sounds now it is rated I believe if
they're<00:03:22.230> 15<00:03:22.739> or<00:03:22.980> 20<00:03:23.280> watts<00:03:23.459> times<00:03:23.819> 2<00:03:24.120> that's

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
they're 15 or 20 watts times 2 that's

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.479 
they're 15 or 20 watts times 2 that's
why<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.540> wanted<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.870> do<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> bench<00:03:25.920> test<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.400> see

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
why I wanted to do a bench test and see

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.710 
why I wanted to do a bench test and see
what<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:26.790> put<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:27.300> here<00:03:27.480> get<00:03:27.690> a

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
what it really put out but here get a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:04:01.710 
what it really put out but here get a
good<00:03:27.959> listen<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> this

the<00:04:13.090> two<00:04:13.240> leads<00:04:13.480> together<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:14.260> want<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:14.920> have<00:04:15.010> it

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
the two leads together I want to have it

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.199 
the two leads together I want to have it
set<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.340> own<00:04:15.580> mode<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.799> stays<00:04:18.070> at<00:04:18.220> about<00:04:18.400> 0.4<00:04:18.910> so

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
set to own mode it stays at about 0.4 so

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.490 
set to own mode it stays at about 0.4 so
that<00:04:19.329> lets<00:04:19.510> me<00:04:19.630> know<00:04:19.660> there's<00:04:19.900> point<00:04:20.230> for

that lets me know there's point for

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.030 
that lets me know there's point for
resistance<00:04:21.459> built<00:04:22.150> into<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.480> wires<00:04:22.720> here<00:04:23.110> so

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
resistance built into the wires here so

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.970 
resistance built into the wires here so
what<00:04:24.730> I'm<00:04:24.850> going<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.270> either<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.530> or<00:04:26.560> the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
what I'm going to do either that or the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.290 
what I'm going to do either that or the
thing<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:27.280> just<00:04:27.400> not<00:04:27.580> calibrated<00:04:28.000> properly

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
thing is just not calibrated properly

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.420 
thing is just not calibrated properly
I'll<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.290> subtract<00:04:29.680> point<00:04:29.950> four<00:04:30.190> from

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
I'll just subtract point four from

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.740 
I'll just subtract point four from
whatever<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.790> get<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.150> measurement<00:04:31.570> from<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
whatever I get the measurement from the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.080 
whatever I get the measurement from the
speaker<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:32.950> I'll<00:04:33.070> know<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.250> I've<00:04:33.580> got

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
speaker and then I'll know that I've got

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.570 
speaker and then I'll know that I've got
the<00:04:34.210> correct<00:04:34.450> measurement<00:04:34.990> so<00:04:35.310> just<00:04:36.310> go<00:04:36.460> ahead

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the correct measurement so just go ahead

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.000 
the correct measurement so just go ahead
and<00:04:36.790> do<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:40.690> I'll<00:04:40.780> zoom<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.320> in<00:04:41.410> some<00:04:41.800> so

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
and do this and I'll zoom it in some so

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:50.580 
and do this and I'll zoom it in some so
you<00:04:42.070> can<00:04:42.340> see<00:04:48.660> looks<00:04:49.660> like<00:04:49.870> it's<00:04:50.050> steady<00:04:50.410> at

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
you can see looks like it's steady at

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.330 
you can see looks like it's steady at
7.2<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.240> we'll<00:04:52.420> subtract<00:04:52.900> 0.4<00:04:53.680> we'll<00:04:53.890> get<00:04:54.070> six

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
7.2 so we'll subtract 0.4 we'll get six

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.390 
7.2 so we'll subtract 0.4 we'll get six
point<00:04:54.610> eight<00:04:54.810> okay<00:04:55.810> as<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.320> noticed<00:04:56.740> got

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
point eight okay as you just noticed got

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.190 
point eight okay as you just noticed got
a<00:04:57.430> measurement<00:04:57.850> of<00:04:58.060> about<00:04:58.390> six<00:04:58.870> point<00:04:59.110> eight

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
a measurement of about six point eight

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.830 
a measurement of about six point eight

is I'm gonna have to just test those two

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.320 
is I'm gonna have to just test those two
different<00:05:11.169> modes<00:05:11.350> and<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.520> can't<00:05:12.760> really<00:05:12.940> set<00:05:13.300> a

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
different modes and I can't really set a

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.520 
different modes and I can't really set a
specific<00:05:13.830> 6.8<00:05:14.830> ohm<00:05:15.520> load<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.210> we'll<00:05:16.990> try<00:05:17.229> 8

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
specific 6.8 ohm load so we'll try 8

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.960 
specific 6.8 ohm load so we'll try 8
ohms<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:18.160> 4<00:05:18.370> ohms<00:05:19.110> got<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.260> 1<00:05:20.620> kilohertz<00:05:20.979> test

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
ohms and 4 ohms got the 1 kilohertz test

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.300 
ohms and 4 ohms got the 1 kilohertz test
tone<00:05:22.890> going<00:05:23.890> into<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:25.380> got<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.560> o<00:05:26.590> scope<00:05:27.040> hooked

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
tone going into I got the o scope hooked

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.390 
tone going into I got the o scope hooked
up<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.700> right<00:05:27.850> now<00:05:28.000> we're<00:05:28.180> in<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.390> 4<00:05:28.690> own<00:05:28.930> mode

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
up and right now we're in the 4 own mode

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.760 
up and right now we're in the 4 own mode
so<00:05:30.400> I've<00:05:30.490> got<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.880> O<00:05:30.910> scope<00:05:31.330> set<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.290> to

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
so I've got the O scope set to the to

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.620 
so I've got the O scope set to the to
the<00:05:32.890> 4<00:05:33.100> ohm<00:05:33.250> mode<00:05:33.490> and<00:05:33.729> let's<00:05:33.880> test<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.479> see

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
the 4 ohm mode and let's test it and see

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:43.230 
the 4 ohm mode and let's test it and see
what<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.110> will<00:05:35.200> do

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.969 

twenty<00:05:44.240> point<00:05:44.509> two<00:05:44.720> watts<00:05:44.960> Wow

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
twenty point two watts Wow

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.090 
twenty point two watts Wow
it's<00:05:46.490> rated<00:05:46.789> at<00:05:46.880> 20<00:05:47.150> watts<00:05:47.330> per<00:05:47.539> channel

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
it's rated at 20 watts per channel

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.590 
it's rated at 20 watts per channel
pretty<00:05:49.100> good<00:05:49.509> let's<00:05:50.509> try<00:05:50.720> eight<00:05:50.900> ohms

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
pretty good let's try eight ohms

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.090 
pretty good let's try eight ohms
alright<00:05:53.600> now<00:05:53.870> we<00:05:53.930> have<00:05:54.169> it<00:05:54.259> hooked<00:05:54.380> up<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.620> an<00:05:54.919> 8

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
alright now we have it hooked up to an 8

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.279 
alright now we have it hooked up to an 8
ohm<00:05:55.130> load<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:56.060> we're<00:05:56.600> still<00:05:56.780> doing<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.050> 1

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
ohm load and we're still doing the 1

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.350 
ohm load and we're still doing the 1
kilohertz<00:05:57.650> test<00:05:58.190> home<00:05:58.430> so<00:05:58.729> let's<00:05:58.910> see<00:05:59.150> what

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
kilohertz test home so let's see what

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:08.710 
kilohertz test home so let's see what
it'll<00:05:59.539> do<00:06:04.120> ten<00:06:05.120> point<00:06:05.539> four<00:06:05.870> six<00:06:06.199> watts<00:06:07.720> not

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
it'll do ten point four six watts not

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.950 
it'll do ten point four six watts not
bad<00:06:10.210> alright<00:06:11.210> now<00:06:11.389> we're<00:06:11.600> really<00:06:11.780> getting

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
bad alright now we're really getting
