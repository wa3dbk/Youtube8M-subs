has<00:02:07.710> those<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> same<00:02:08.910> head<00:02:09.629> sculpt

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
has those would be the same head sculpt

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.600 
has those would be the same head sculpt
painted<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
painted and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.699 
painted and
more<00:02:12.030> textured<00:02:12.269> actually<00:02:12.810> like<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.319> crayons

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
more textured actually like the crayons

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.740 
more textured actually like the crayons
more<00:02:14.010> than<00:02:14.159> Legos<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.209> reason<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:15.690> just

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
more than Legos for some reason not just

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.470 
more than Legos for some reason not just
because<00:02:16.110> they're<00:02:16.230> cheaper<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.480> thought

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
because they're cheaper but I thought

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.899 
because they're cheaper but I thought
that<00:02:18.750> better<00:02:18.959> articulation<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:20.459> quality

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
that better articulation in quality

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.539 
that better articulation in quality
control<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.420> still<00:02:21.540> an<00:02:21.659> issue<00:02:21.840> on<00:02:22.400> terms<00:02:23.400> of

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
control is still an issue on terms of

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.399 
control is still an issue on terms of
plastic<00:02:23.909> manufacturing<00:02:24.510> pain<00:02:24.690> apps<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.080> all

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
plastic manufacturing pain apps but all

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.820 
plastic manufacturing pain apps but all
in<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.799> I'm<00:02:26.010> very<00:02:26.430> happy<00:02:26.849> with<00:02:27.000> these<00:02:27.090> crayons

in all I'm very happy with these crayons

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.890 
in all I'm very happy with these crayons
more<00:02:28.830> than<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.099> Legos<00:02:29.489> so<00:02:29.910> Optimus<00:02:30.569> Prime

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
more than the Legos so Optimus Prime

five bags probably this guy Sentinel
Prime<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.090> got<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.269> color<00:02:36.750> wrong

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.009 
Prime I think they got the color wrong
on<00:02:37.739> his<00:02:37.950> torso<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.329> can<00:02:39.450> see<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.780> Box

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
on his torso as you can see on the Box

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.759 
on his torso as you can see on the Box
he's<00:02:40.500> supposed<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.069> red<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:43.440> anyway

he's supposed to be red and but anyway

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.039 
he's supposed to be red and but anyway
it's<00:02:44.640> still<00:02:44.760> okay<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.420> nice<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.900> a

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
it's still okay it's nice to have a

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.940 
it's still okay it's nice to have a
sentinel<00:02:46.440> prime<00:02:47.239> Megatron<00:02:48.319> this<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.769> he

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
sentinel prime Megatron this is when he

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.920 
sentinel prime Megatron this is when he
still<00:02:50.340> transformed<00:02:50.819> into<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.060> gun<00:02:51.420> that's<00:02:51.780> why

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
still transformed into a gun that's why

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.380 
still transformed into a gun that's why
he's<00:02:52.079> got<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.290> scope<00:02:52.590> as<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.280> blaster<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.180> his

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
issues there you go some X just plastic

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.400 
issues there you go some X just plastic
they're<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.970> bad<00:03:09.209> not<00:03:09.510> bad<00:03:09.720> at<00:03:09.750> all<00:03:09.959> actually
