00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.950
 Hello dear friends of gambling beside 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.209
 new let's play today with tetris 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.650
 Klassik and I start here 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.240
 level 5 to see how far I'm getting 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.070
 and the whole thing is a faster too 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:28.409
 Let's go Let's see 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.119
 how far I'm coming from yours 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:33.720
 supernatural what is here with distance 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.270
 probably the best I do not want 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.280
 say clown but the best version of the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.510
 , game that we can play us so free 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.590
 in the browser course as always in vain 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.680
 play on time and I can see 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.650
 I can not see it 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:58.020
 this game has nothing to say even 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.400
 that will be pretty bad later 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.610
 still to fatality I see that now 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.610
 beautiful 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:50.580
 at least this sure that I was 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.740
 a bit to talk about that is 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.740
 actually speaks for some games 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.869
 so down here to the left as it could 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:10.759
 for my taste too long 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:19.810
 give another in another building block that 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.810
 not two less 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:37.239
 now what could really happen to me 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.239
 that does not help 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.090
 but not fast dementi sees
