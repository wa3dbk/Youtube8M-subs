00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.820 
Tonka trucks style kind of durable toys
and<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.730> idea<00:01:03.970> came<00:01:04.180> from<00:01:04.239> this<00:01:05.230> game<00:01:05.440> I<00:01:05.620> play

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
and the idea came from this game I play

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.680 
and the idea came from this game I play
with<00:01:05.950> my<00:01:06.010> niece<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.550> nephew<00:01:06.910> we<00:01:07.270> call<00:01:07.510> it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
with my niece and nephew we call it

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.440 
with my niece and nephew we call it
robot<00:01:08.200> hospital<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.900> fix<00:01:11.340> imaginary

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
robot hospital we we fix imaginary

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.910 
robot hospital we we fix imaginary
robots<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.660> we<00:01:13.960> take<00:01:14.170> tools<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.860> we

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
robots we we take tools and we

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.070 
robots we we take tools and we
continually<00:01:15.400> keep<00:01:15.640> working<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.150> it<00:01:16.180> until<00:01:16.300> one

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
continually keep working on it until one

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.080 
continually keep working on it until one
of<00:01:17.110> them<00:01:17.350> deems<00:01:17.590> it's<00:01:17.890> fixed<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.640> they<00:01:18.940> always

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
of them deems it's fixed and they always

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.810 
of them deems it's fixed and they always
break<00:01:19.450> down<00:01:19.480> that's<00:01:19.990> kind<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.800> game<00:01:20.980> so<00:01:21.790> I

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
break down that's kind of the game so I

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.149 
break down that's kind of the game so I
made<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.090> tie<00:01:22.780> for<00:01:23.110> my<00:01:23.380> niece<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:23.830> nephew

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
made a tie for my niece and nephew

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.500 
made a tie for my niece and nephew
basically<00:01:24.580> out<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.700> something<00:01:25.120> like<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.360> I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
basically out of something like this I

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.730 
basically out of something like this I
have<00:01:25.570> tin<00:01:25.840> cans<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.500> I<00:01:28.290> powder-coated<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.409> red

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
have tin cans and I powder-coated it red

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.100 
have tin cans and I powder-coated it red
and<00:01:29.770> put<00:01:30.490> flashing<00:01:31.090> lights<00:01:31.330> in<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.659> and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
and put flashing lights in it and

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.020 
and put flashing lights in it and
spinning<00:01:32.740> motors<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.370> a<00:01:33.460> lot<00:01:33.670> of<00:01:33.700> light-up

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
spinning motors and a lot of light-up

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.940 
spinning motors and a lot of light-up
switches<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.780> they<00:01:35.200> kind<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.500> loved<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.830> and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
switches and they kind of loved it and

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.430 
switches and they kind of loved it and
it<00:01:36.070> was<00:01:36.220> it's<00:01:36.790> really<00:01:37.030> solid<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.600> tough<00:01:37.810> but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
it was it's really solid and tough but

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.140 
it was it's really solid and tough but
eventually<00:01:38.920> they<00:01:39.190> broke<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:39.670> course<00:01:39.850> and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
eventually they broke it of course and

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.240 
eventually they broke it of course and
now<00:01:40.750> we<00:01:40.810> have<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.229> do<00:01:41.350> robot<00:01:41.650> hospital<00:01:42.070> for

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
now we have to do robot hospital for

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.149 
now we have to do robot hospital for
real<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.670> fix<00:01:42.909> it<00:01:43.060> with<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.320> robot<00:01:44.470> ambulance

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
real and fix it with the robot ambulance

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.500 
real and fix it with the robot ambulance
I<00:01:45.340> guess<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.700> could<00:01:45.850> be<00:01:46.000> making<00:01:46.210> house<00:01:46.479> calls

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
I guess I could be making house calls

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.399 
I guess I could be making house calls
now<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.640> schools<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.390> maker<00:01:49.690> fairs<00:01:50.020> and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
now to to schools and maker fairs and

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.980 
now to to schools and maker fairs and
really<00:01:50.650> just<00:01:50.890> kind<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.250> promote<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.810> can

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
really just kind of promote that you can

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.660 
really just kind of promote that you can
make<00:01:53.140> your<00:01:53.320> own<00:01:53.350> toys<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:54.100> can<00:01:54.130> fix<00:01:54.460> your<00:01:54.549> own

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
make your own toys you can fix your own

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.280 
make your own toys you can fix your own
toys<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.270> have<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.450> lot<00:01:55.600> of<00:01:55.630> fun<00:01:55.870> with<00:01:56.080> it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
toys and you have a lot of fun with it

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.370 
toys and you have a lot of fun with it
so<00:01:57.159> that's<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.400> basic<00:01:57.670> idea<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.150> hope<00:01:59.049> that<00:01:59.290> it
