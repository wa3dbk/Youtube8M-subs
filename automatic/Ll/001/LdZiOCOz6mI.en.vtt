the wire is take that wire in a vise and

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.810 
the wire is take that wire in a vise and
I<00:04:37.960> will<00:04:38.139> actually<00:04:38.229> wrap<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.889> skirt<00:04:39.190> on<00:04:39.340> that

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
I will actually wrap the skirt on that

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.249 
I will actually wrap the skirt on that
with<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.210> wire<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:40.660> then<00:04:40.780> I'll<00:04:40.900> cinch<00:04:41.169> that

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
with the wire and then I'll cinch that

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.040 
with the wire and then I'll cinch that
up<00:04:41.590> I'll<00:04:42.400> take<00:04:42.580> my<00:04:42.910> pair<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.150> hemostats<00:04:43.389> and

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
up I'll take my pair of hemostats and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.439 
up I'll take my pair of hemostats and
I'll<00:04:44.440> pull<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.800> tight<00:04:45.070> as<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.340> can<00:04:45.580> so<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.360> it

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
I'll pull that tight as I can so that it

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.149 
I'll pull that tight as I can so that it
does<00:04:46.599> not<00:04:46.720> allow<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.050> skirt<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.650> turn<00:04:47.830> on<00:04:48.039> the

does not allow the skirt to turn on the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.850 
does not allow the skirt to turn on the
head<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.580> then<00:04:48.760> I'll<00:04:48.849> use<00:04:49.030> my<00:04:49.380> my<00:04:50.380> side<00:04:50.620> cutter

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
head and then I'll use my my side cutter

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.200 
head and then I'll use my my side cutter
or<00:04:51.099> in<00:04:51.250> this<00:04:51.340> case<00:04:51.490> I'll<00:04:51.699> need<00:04:51.729> a<00:04:51.849> nose<00:04:52.000> with

or in this case I'll need a nose with
the<00:04:52.330> cutter<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.990> cut<00:04:53.139> the<00:04:53.199> remaining<00:04:53.560> excess

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
the cutter to cut the remaining excess

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.540 
the cutter to cut the remaining excess
I'm<00:04:54.580> off<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.060> strand<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:56.380> wire<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:57.310> the

medium size you can actually use the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.600 
medium size you can actually use the
smaller<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.620> use<00:04:59.830> that<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.039> little<00:05:00.280> bit<00:05:00.400> as<00:05:00.490> well

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
colors up here as you see I've got some

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.140 
colors up here as you see I've got some
different<00:05:23.770> color<00:05:24.070> options<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:24.669> some<00:05:24.849> skirts

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
different color options and some skirts

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.879 
different color options and some skirts
and<00:05:25.659> also<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:26.199> notice<00:05:26.349> there's<00:05:26.740> some

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
and also if you notice there's some

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.260 
and also if you notice there's some
different<00:05:27.220> widths<00:05:27.520> are<00:05:27.610> kind<00:05:27.789> of<00:05:27.820> hard<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.090> see

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
different widths are kind of hard to see

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.969 
different widths are kind of hard to see
probably<00:05:28.659> through<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.900> video<00:05:29.169> but<00:05:29.740> there<00:05:29.860> are

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
probably through the video but there are

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.409 
probably through the video but there are
some<00:05:30.159> different<00:05:30.550> widths<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:30.970> you<00:05:31.060> can<00:05:31.240> see

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
some different widths that you can see

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.060 
some different widths that you can see
as<00:05:31.570> well<00:05:31.780> too<00:05:32.020> so<00:05:32.050> you<00:05:32.349> can<00:05:32.470> see<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.680> shorter

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
as well too so you can see the shorter

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.830 
as well too so you can see the shorter
shorter<00:05:33.759> wets<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.300> can<00:05:34.449> multiple

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
shorter wets that you can multiple

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.689 
shorter wets that you can multiple
different<00:05:35.530> colors<00:05:35.770> together<00:05:36.009> to<00:05:36.370> make<00:05:36.490> some

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
different colors together to make some

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.020 
different colors together to make some
surface<00:05:37.270> precise<00:05:37.659> color<00:05:37.930> jigs<00:05:38.729> also<00:05:39.729> I've<00:05:39.849> got

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
surface precise color jigs also I've got

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.969 
surface precise color jigs also I've got
over<00:05:40.150> here<00:05:40.270> some<00:05:41.139> of<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.320> jigs<00:05:41.590> I've<00:05:41.740> made

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
over here some of the jigs I've made

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.920 
over here some of the jigs I've made
previously<00:05:42.699> and<00:05:43.270> also<00:05:43.360> some<00:05:43.750> of<00:05:43.870> the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
different head combinations that I use I

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.879 
different head combinations that I use I
like<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.720> use<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.990> bigger<00:05:47.199> ones<00:05:47.470> like<00:05:47.590> these

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
like to use the bigger ones like these

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.440 
like to use the bigger ones like these
