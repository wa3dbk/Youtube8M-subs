00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 and here we are with another top five later 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.180
 having finished with the poor of ba rock 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.160
 we can of course to the type that is almost 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'm talking about pokemon type 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.379
 land 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 here's to you my top five in the fifth 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.830
 position we find lambie flashes trio 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.170
 of goods or duke trio is very much 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.199
 very ambiguous as a pokémon very very much 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.910
 if one does not realize well that one is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 speaking of little one could think of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.399
 a porn but it doesn't matter is not that the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.809
 detail is adorable because when it is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.370
 he was in the first generations of 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.399
 I usually catch him always in the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.040
 black cave at level 29 x bow say 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.110
 go to defeat the drives already given that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.809
 it was quite difficult to defeat if 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 bockmann type electro and then went 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 catch him using repellent mi 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.860
 happened to look like level 29 with a nice one 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.660
 with pit and then maybe even earthquake but 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.489
 I don't remember this well and so 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.730
 according to me the fifth position for these 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.730
 nice memories 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 at position 14 he owed a common people as well 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.020
 I really can't name sun slash's 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.110
 I usually call choice then it is a species 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.810
 of mole ie one is a mole in a few 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.970
 words is a simply made mole 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:28.270
 with spikes that look like this 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.070
 species of hedgehog makes no sense as 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.200
 combination of pokémon but I like it 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.050
 very simple fact that if we 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.940
 we really wanted to think of it as the dragon 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.980
 ball if we see his version 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.990
 scenic with red hair 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.790
 we can safely think about bersani 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.700
 that we can have some kind of 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.580
 kio ken evolution so i am 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.530
 he is particularly mentally ill and here 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.420
 the description of bugs like urbino the box 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.950
 the lashley sense body covered spikes 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.450
 leathery so lido armor parts 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.910
 hardened with curies than with a motorcycle 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.580
 south base year by new ones growing up 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.160
 under the precedents in short from is a nice 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.250
 pokémon and approaches that much dragon 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.250
 ball 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.750
 at the third position we find the can 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.540
 however the face one of the faces of 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.200
 stupid of sembre that is almost as much 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.970
 serve you find it strange because its true 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.709
 evolution but learn frost punch that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.659
 he has no hands let's say he could 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.700
 confuse very well common bills 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.620
 or I think I adore him just for that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.260
 because with his kind of land we say 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.019
 that some could still be 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.680
 confuse given that on the ground water but not 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.200
 it matters 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.829
 the third position because it has a face 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.150
 too stupid is very strong in defense 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.739
 I must say that quite defensive 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.379
 it can also confuse i 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.700
 pokémon of type electro then third 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.840
 deserved position for him too 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.140
 enough of the power and the 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.140
 strategy 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.020
 at the second position a voucher I have 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
 used very often in the mid game of 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.660
 platinum diamond i 'm talking about 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.910
 ipo from a con ibo dow its curse 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.950
 plus the rock life we ​​say that 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.550
 it caused many many many many many 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.990
 many problems then I started to spread 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.630
 obviously stone sizes earthquake a 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.580
 gust but it does n't matter much 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.890
 used because it is very defensive and has 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.840
 a lot of life so it could be a 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.200
 beautiful wall to use in various 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.780
 team 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.190
 today, of course, 30 would be destroyed 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.170
 seconds that is not a big problem 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.850
 but it was only to remember the beautiful ones 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.040
 diamond old times for the plugin 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.040
 so second position for ipo dow 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.400
 it is the first position strangely 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.950
 we find a starter such as a starter 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.930
 at war earth by land 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.810
 we say that one already understands from the name of 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.500
 what kind is yes we can say so 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.720
 ok though on its primary type is 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.930
 the air but his shot is secondary to 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.640
 earth can be really a lot we say 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.350
 very useful in many situations 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.690
 I also like it up front as a fact 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.880
 this made of giant triceratops 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.690
 however, this dinosaur is not unprepared 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.390
 I'm wrong I'm not a dinosaur I think 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.250
 with a kind of small landscape 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.400
 on his back and his beautiful tree 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.830
 looks like he has two mounts on his back 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.540
 and also the shiny version we say that 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.040
 they could do it much better 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.400
 but let's say they are busy anyway 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.230
 enough to do it and then 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.150
 I think the first one deserves a lot 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.850
 position although I must say that gr tel 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.020
 the scenic person the most beautiful bike is 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.150
 so guys this was mine 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.710
 very simple top five by boko montipo 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.450
 terrace updates after the like 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.130
 as a description write it seems to me the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.340
