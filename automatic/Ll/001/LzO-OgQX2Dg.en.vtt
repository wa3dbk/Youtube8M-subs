 andruw web 7 in this video I bring you 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 a top of the best 5 phones that 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.030
 find for less than $ 350 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 among which samsung and sony stand out 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 so let's start with the video 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.949
 the samsung galaxy grand prix we started 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.410
 with a representative of the family of 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.820
 samsung this device is geared 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.410
 for those people who love 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.930
 become selfish because of your camera 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.260
 5 megapixel wide front 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.329
 angle has a qhd screen of 5 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.550
 inches as is usual for 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.769
 mid-range devices has a 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.870
 400 snapdragon processor accompanied 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.399
 for one gigabyte of ram memory as for 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.870
 your storage I stayed a little 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.790
 dissatisfied because he owns 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.129
 only 8 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.590
 available to the user 5 gigabytes 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.300
 but what supplants this problem is 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.019
 a slot for microsd cards 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.339

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.080

 initially that device has a 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.619
 super front camera 5 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.840
 megapixels and a rear camera that does not 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.259
 stays behind 8 megapixels both 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 with the capabilities of recording in full hd 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.310
 finally this device comes 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.069
 running from factory to android 4.4 clip 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 cat with a 2-week interface is the 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.700
 samsung customization layer and the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 main reason why that device 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.850
 is in this top is his amazing 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.270

 find in this top since it has a 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.170
 spectacular design which is seen 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.360
 that manufacturers can elaborate 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.760
 mobile phones with good materials without envelope 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.800

 'rogue' engine technology that improves the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.850
 quality of video image and photography 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.310
 as to what is going to move that 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.810
 device has a station 400 s 4 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.459

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.200
 accompanied with a gigabyte of memory

 ram sony on all your devices 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.500
 highlight by your camera and this new 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.390

 officially up to android 4.3 and link 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.890
 but one of the advantages of those 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.480
 positive is that there are several 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.340
 developers which have already 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.910
 come to android the only thing 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.709
 estimated in amazon is $ 164 the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.150
 one plus quads for me is one of the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.980
 best phones that exist until the 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.300
 moment presents a challenge and a 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.790
 true competition brands so 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.500
 recognized as samsung sony and lg like

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.140
 users put their eyes on one plus 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.450
