00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
only two success criteria it would be to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.579 
only two success criteria it would be to
have<00:00:53.399> detailed<00:00:53.969> knowledge<00:00:54.179> and<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.170> link<00:00:55.410> your

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
have detailed knowledge and to link your

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:56.990 
have detailed knowledge and to link your
answers<00:00:55.949> back<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> question<00:00:56.579> really

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
answers back to the question really

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540 
answers back to the question really
clearly<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> explicitly<00:00:57.949> now<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.010> detailed

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
clearly and explicitly now the detailed

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.669 
clearly and explicitly now the detailed
knowledge<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.539> big<00:01:00.809> challenge<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.379> terms<00:01:01.499> of

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
knowledge is a big challenge in terms of

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.200 
knowledge is a big challenge in terms of
preparation<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.339> revision<00:01:04.880> GCSE<00:01:05.880> history

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
preparation and revision GCSE history

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.690 
preparation and revision GCSE history
certainly<00:01:06.659> no<00:01:06.869> harder<00:01:07.350> than<00:01:07.380> any<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.829> GCSE

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
certainly no harder than any other GCSE

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.780 
certainly no harder than any other GCSE
that<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> might<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.270> studying<00:01:09.920> but<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.520> can't

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that you might be studying but you can't

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
that you might be studying but you can't
kind<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> fall<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:12.930> own<00:01:13.110> knowledge

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
kind of fall back on your own knowledge

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.319 
kind of fall back on your own knowledge
if<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.890> sure<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> put<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.090> can't

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
if you're not sure what to put you can't

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.630 
if you're not sure what to put you can't
fall<00:01:15.540> back<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.840> general<00:01:16.259> knowledge<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:17.430> don't

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
fall back on general knowledge you don't

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.730 
fall back on general knowledge you don't
I<00:01:17.909> would<00:01:18.540> imagine<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.020> don't<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.409> stuff

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I would imagine you don't know stuff

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
I would imagine you don't know stuff
about<00:01:20.000> medicine<00:01:21.000> through<00:01:21.149> time<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.810> you've

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
about medicine through time that you've

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
about medicine through time that you've
not<00:01:22.140> learned<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.590> lessons<00:01:23.040> before<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.670> started

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
not learned in lessons before we started

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.940 
not learned in lessons before we started
studying<00:01:24.540> GCSE<00:01:25.079> history<00:01:25.470> I'm<00:01:25.560> guessing<00:01:25.860> he

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
studying GCSE history I'm guessing he

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190 
studying GCSE history I'm guessing he
didn't<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.909> much<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.479> anything<00:01:27.630> about

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
didn't know very much or anything about

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109 
didn't know very much or anything about
William<00:01:28.590> Harvey<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.399> he<00:01:29.460> discovered<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
William Harvey and how he discovered the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.270 
William Harvey and how he discovered the
blood<00:01:30.750> circulation<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> blood<00:01:32.100> was

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
blood circulation and the blood was

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
blood circulation and the blood was
pumped<00:01:32.670> by<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.790> heart<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.540> all<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.380> your

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
pumped by the heart to all all of your

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
pumped by the heart to all all of your
knowledge<00:01:34.649> on<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.130> learnt<00:01:35.399> in<00:01:35.579> class<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
knowledge on that is learnt in class so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.469 
knowledge on that is learnt in class so
you<00:01:36.840> can't<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> lag<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.939> GCSE

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you can't kind of lag it with GCSE

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
you can't kind of lag it with GCSE
history<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.259> do<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.040> stuff

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
history you do need to know your stuff

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.319 
history you do need to know your stuff
so<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.700> need<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.969> do<00:01:42.119> some<00:01:42.299> serious

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
so you do need to do some serious

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.780 
so you do need to do some serious
