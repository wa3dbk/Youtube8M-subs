going<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:39.040> HTC<00:01:39.840> evo<00:01:40.840> design<00:01:41.140> 4g

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
going and this is the HTC evo design 4g

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800 
going and this is the HTC evo design 4g
now<00:01:43.000> this<00:01:43.689> has<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.380> four<00:01:44.979> inch<00:01:45.310> diagonal<00:01:45.820> LCD

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
now this has a four inch diagonal LCD

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.330 
now this has a four inch diagonal LCD
screen<00:01:47.229> with<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> resolution<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:49.170> 540<00:01:50.170> x<00:01:50.530> 960

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
screen with a resolution of 540 x 960

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.630 
screen with a resolution of 540 x 960
pixels<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.360> this<00:01:52.659> is<00:01:52.840> what<00:01:52.990> they<00:01:53.110> call<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.640> qHD

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
pixels so this is what they call a qHD

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.179 
pixels so this is what they call a qHD
resolution<00:01:54.960> screen<00:01:55.960> again<00:01:56.259> it's<00:01:56.439> four<00:01:56.770> inches

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
resolution screen again it's four inches

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.539 
resolution screen again it's four inches
diagonal<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.390> not<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.869> 4.3<00:01:59.680> inches<00:02:00.040> that

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
diagonal it is not the 4.3 inches that

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.450 
diagonal it is not the 4.3 inches that
the<00:02:00.880> evo<00:02:01.270> 4g<00:02:01.840> was<00:02:02.049> now<00:02:02.590> let's<00:02:02.799> take<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.040> look<00:02:03.130> at

is the microSD card now it comes
pre-installed<00:04:11.109> with<00:04:11.560> an<00:04:11.829> 8<00:04:12.069> gigabyte<00:04:12.639> microSD

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
pre-installed with an 8 gigabyte microSD

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.620 
pre-installed with an 8 gigabyte microSD
card<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:14.319> phone<00:04:14.560> itself<00:04:15.040> has<00:04:15.669> got<00:04:16.000> four<00:04:16.359> gig

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
card the phone itself has got four gig

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.170 
card the phone itself has got four gig
of<00:04:16.780> storage<00:04:17.259> but<00:04:17.859> three<00:04:18.340> gig<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.880> storage

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
of storage but three gig of that storage

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.270 
of storage but three gig of that storage
is<00:04:19.449> used<00:04:19.690> up<00:04:19.870> by<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:20.199> operating<00:04:20.680> system<00:04:20.799> so

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
is used up by the operating system so

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.520 
is used up by the operating system so
only<00:04:21.489> one<00:04:21.759> gig<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.120> available<00:04:22.659> for<00:04:23.110> your<00:04:23.229> files

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
only one gig is available for your files

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.060 
only one gig is available for your files
so<00:04:23.940> basically<00:04:24.940> there's<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:26.139> gig<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.530> storage

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
so basically there's one gig of storage

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.890 
so basically there's one gig of storage
for<00:04:27.310> your<00:04:27.340> files<00:04:27.639> still<00:04:28.000> available<00:04:28.539> on<00:04:28.719> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
for your files still available on the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.990 
for your files still available on the
phone<00:04:29.110> plus<00:04:29.800> an<00:04:29.979> eight<00:04:30.159> gig<00:04:30.400> car

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
phone plus an eight gig car

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.210 
phone plus an eight gig car
right<00:04:31.630> there<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.440> you've<00:04:32.590> got<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.740> total<00:04:33.100> of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
right there so you've got a total of

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.250 
right there so you've got a total of
nine<00:04:33.250> gigs<00:04:33.670> of<00:04:33.940> storage<00:04:34.030> right<00:04:34.900> out<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
nine gigs of storage right out of the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.680 
nine gigs of storage right out of the
box<00:04:35.470> now<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.250> put<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.640> battery<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.330> zoom

box now to put the battery and the zoom
in<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.290> have<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.530> flip<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.950> open<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:40.330> sim

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
in you have to flip this open the sim

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.140 
in you have to flip this open the sim
goes<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.170> like<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:43.710> just<00:04:44.710> like<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
goes in like this just like that and the

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.640 
goes in like this just like that and the
battery<00:04:46.480> slides<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.200> like<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:50.410> flip

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
battery slides in like this and you flip

00:04:50.650 --> 00:05:06.840 
battery slides in like this and you flip
this<00:04:50.830> back<00:04:50.890> over<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:52.890> put<00:04:53.890> this<00:04:54.070> cap<00:04:54.610> on

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.550 

there<00:05:07.850> we<00:05:08.000> go<00:05:08.120> took<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.600> nice<00:05:08.750> healthy<00:05:08.960> push<00:05:09.320> and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
there we go took a nice healthy push and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.070 
there we go took a nice healthy push and
that's<00:05:10.130> how<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.370> battery<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:10.880> sim<00:05:11.390> get

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
that's how the battery and sim get

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.570 
that's how the battery and sim get
installed<00:05:12.590> let's<00:05:13.340> go<00:05:13.460> ahead<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.730> turn<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.090> on

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
installed let's go ahead and turn it on

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.610 
installed let's go ahead and turn it on
now<00:05:16.580> while<00:05:16.820> this<00:05:17.000> is<00:05:17.210> booting<00:05:17.540> up<00:05:17.660> I<00:05:17.960> want<00:05:18.530> to

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
now while this is booting up I want to

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.980 
now while this is booting up I want to
mention<00:05:18.770> that<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.370> evo<00:05:19.820> design<00:05:19.970> 4g<00:05:20.180> has<00:05:20.810> got<00:05:20.960> a

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
mention that the evo design 4g has got a

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.220 
mention that the evo design 4g has got a

1.2 gigahertz processor it's a single
core<00:05:24.500> processor<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:26.060> has<00:05:26.980> 768<00:05:27.980> megabytes

core processor and it has 768 megabytes
of<00:05:28.820> processor<00:05:29.390> ram<00:05:29.600> so<00:05:29.930> those<00:05:30.380> are<00:05:30.530> both

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
of processor ram so those are both

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.320 
of processor ram so those are both
pretty<00:05:30.890> good<00:05:31.100> numbers<00:05:31.400> it's<00:05:31.640> a<00:05:31.760> single<00:05:32.120> core

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
pretty good numbers it's a single core

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.630 
pretty good numbers it's a single core
processor<00:05:32.410> but<00:05:33.410> it's<00:05:33.530> a<00:05:33.650> fast<00:05:33.950> single<00:05:34.460> core
