00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
started to explore what kind of process

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.179 
started to explore what kind of process
could<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:30.869> develop<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.799> easily<00:01:31.950> came

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
could they develop and they easily came

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.670 
could they develop and they easily came
across<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> speak<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.689> LEGO<00:01:34.079> brick<00:01:34.350> which

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
across so to speak the LEGO brick which

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.670 
across so to speak the LEGO brick which
is<00:01:34.829> hard<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> avoid<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.790> sight<00:01:36.360> Lego

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
is hard to avoid when you in sight Lego

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.260 
is hard to avoid when you in sight Lego
and<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:37.950> said<00:01:38.070> maybe<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.030> use

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and just said maybe we can actually use

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
and just said maybe we can actually use
this<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.680> helps

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
this thing because if it really helps

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.149 
this thing because if it really helps
the<00:01:41.040> children<00:01:42.350> unlock<00:01:43.350> into<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> knowledge

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the children unlock into the knowledge

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.969 
the children unlock into the knowledge
or<00:01:44.700> accelerate<00:01:45.540> their<00:01:45.689> learning<00:01:45.979> there's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
or accelerate their learning there's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.219 
or accelerate their learning there's
really<00:01:47.220> nothing<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.990> should<00:01:48.990> make<00:01:49.110> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
really nothing that should make you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.300 
really nothing that should make you
assume<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.860> wouldn't<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> same

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
assume that you wouldn't do the same

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.550 
assume that you wouldn't do the same
thing<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.670> adults<00:01:50.880> now<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.360> recently<00:01:52.020> why

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
thing for adults now then recently why

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.620 
thing for adults now then recently why
we<00:01:52.799> respond<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.490> laugh<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.360> hope<00:01:54.540> a

we respond or laugh and go and hope a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
we respond or laugh and go and hope a
little<00:01:54.750> bit<00:01:54.990> or<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.320> revenge<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.250> saw<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
little bit or get revenge as I saw it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.350 
little bit or get revenge as I saw it
happen<00:01:56.850> here

happen here

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.429 
happen here
payback<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:59.670> reason<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.630> really

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
payback the reason for that is really

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
payback the reason for that is really
simple<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.540> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
simple and it's right there in that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.389 
simple and it's right there in that
picture<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.229> heavily<00:02:07.399> connected

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
picture these are so heavily connected

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
picture these are so heavily connected
with<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.000> brain<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.229> when<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.590> build

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
with the brain so that when you build

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.300 
with the brain so that when you build
stuff<00:02:11.340> outside<00:02:11.819> yourself<00:02:12.090> external<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
stuff outside yourself external to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.000 
stuff outside yourself external to
yourself<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:14.150> really<00:02:14.209> matters<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.800> is

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
yourself it really matters so this is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.320 
yourself it really matters so this is
really<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:20.030> can<00:02:20.060> talk<00:02:20.300> about

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
really and you can talk about

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.729 
really and you can talk about
construction<00:02:20.660> instrument<00:02:21.319> will<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.530> later

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
construction instrument will do later

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.400 
construction instrument will do later
and<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.920> theories<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.819> really<00:02:23.120> matter

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and the theories but that really matter

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.800 
and the theories but that really matter
now<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.440> thing<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.069> ownership<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> tower

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
now that thing that ownership to a tower

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.229 
now that thing that ownership to a tower
in<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.140> case<00:02:27.410> was<00:02:27.980> exactly<00:02:28.610> what<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.940> owner

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
in this case was exactly what the owner

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.979 
in this case was exactly what the owner
of<00:02:29.660> Lego<00:02:29.930> was<00:02:30.230> looking<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:31.209> when<00:02:32.209> he<00:02:32.390> launched

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
of Lego was looking for when he launched

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.440 
of Lego was looking for when he launched
the<00:02:33.200> research<00:02:33.650> process<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.580> led<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.150> Lego

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
the research process that led to Lego

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.150 
the research process that led to Lego
serious<00:02:35.900> play<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.650> seems<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> make<00:02:37.130> a

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
serious play this seems to make a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.880 
serious play this seems to make a
difference<00:02:37.550> for<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.780> for<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.170> company<00:02:39.650> so

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
difference for the for the company so

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.830 
difference for the for the company so
for<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.130> bottom<00:02:40.459> line<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.209> given<00:02:41.480> company

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
for the bottom line of the given company

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.570 
for the bottom line of the given company
but<00:02:42.470> also<00:02:42.620> seems<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.010> make<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> difference<00:02:43.519> for

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
but also seems to make a difference for

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.400 
but also seems to make a difference for
the<00:02:43.760> people<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:44.150> are<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.870> company<00:02:45.260> and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
the people that are in the company and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.430 
the people that are in the company and
killed<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.760> logically<00:02:47.209> Lego<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.750> really

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
killed and to logically Lego is really

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.860 
killed and to logically Lego is really
about<00:02:48.590> trying<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.950> make<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.250> world<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:50.690> many

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
about trying to make the world a in many

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.289 
about trying to make the world a in many
ways<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.080> better<00:02:51.290> place<00:02:51.680> alright<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.180> one

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
ways a better place alright this is one

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.120 
ways a better place alright this is one
of<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.420> exercises<00:02:53.569> we<00:02:54.110> often<00:02:54.590> use<00:02:54.769> when<00:02:55.010> we're

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
of the exercises we often use when we're

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.860 
of the exercises we often use when we're
trying<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.459> get<00:02:55.640> into<00:02:55.819> a<00:02:55.910> process<00:02:56.360> with<00:02:56.569> Lego

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870

trying to get into a process with Lego
serious<00:02:57.230> play<00:02:57.410> because<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.799> always<00:02:58.069> use<00:02:58.250> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
serious play because you always use a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.309 
serious play because you always use a
couple<00:02:58.519> of<00:02:58.760> steps<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.569> get<00:02:59.690> people<00:03:00.019> into<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
couple of steps to get people into the

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.160 
couple of steps to get people into the
to<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.860> play<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.480> reasons<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:02.930> it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
to the play one of the reasons I like it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.360 
to the play one of the reasons I like it
is<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.470> party<00:03:03.739> there's<00:03:03.920> clearly<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.310> lot

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
is that party there's clearly a lot

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.890 
is that party there's clearly a lot
about<00:03:04.670> metaphors<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.299> know<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.480> climb<00:03:05.690> the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
about metaphors you know you climb the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.140 
about metaphors you know you climb the
stairs<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.860> saw<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.370> flower<00:03:07.670> at<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.970> top

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
stairs and saw the flower at the top

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.720 
stairs and saw the flower at the top
here<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.630> other<00:03:09.080> thing<00:03:09.110> is<00:03:09.319> that<00:03:09.349> most<00:03:09.739> likely

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
here the other thing is that most likely

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.559 
here the other thing is that most likely
none<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.390> were<00:03:11.480> prepared<00:03:11.930> for<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:13.569> most

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
none of you were prepared for this most

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.960 
none of you were prepared for this most
likely<00:03:14.930> also<00:03:15.319> most<00:03:15.799> of<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.040> really<00:03:16.370> told<00:03:16.819> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
likely also most of you really told a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.050 
likely also most of you really told a
nice<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.540> story<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.609> had<00:03:19.730> probably

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
nice little story and you had probably

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.280 
nice little story and you had probably
no<00:03:20.209> clue<00:03:20.390> where<00:03:20.540> you're<00:03:20.570> gonna<00:03:20.780> end<00:03:20.959> up<00:03:21.140> when

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
no clue where you're gonna end up when

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.319 
no clue where you're gonna end up when
you<00:03:21.380> started<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:25.250> kind<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.640> Mirrors<00:03:26.000> really

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
you started that kind of Mirrors really

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.880 
you started that kind of Mirrors really
how<00:03:26.510> our<00:03:26.540> brains<00:03:27.019> work<00:03:27.140> because<00:03:27.470> what<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:27.739> know

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
how our brains work because what we know

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.050 
how our brains work because what we know
about<00:03:28.010> marriage<00:03:28.640> or<00:03:30.069> paranoia<00:03:31.069> politics<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
about marriage or paranoia politics the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.599 
about marriage or paranoia politics the

media is not stored in one nice little
box<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.180> our<00:03:35.269> brains<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.430> many<00:03:37.579> different

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
box in our brains but in many different

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.759 
box in our brains but in many different
places<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.569> we<00:03:38.720> need<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.930> activate<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
places so we need to activate that and

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.319 
places so we need to activate that and
pull<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.130> together<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.579> reasonably

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
pull it together to a reasonably

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.240 
pull it together to a reasonably
coherent<00:03:41.720> story<00:03:42.139> we<00:03:42.560> can<00:03:42.650> actually<00:03:42.950> use<00:03:43.100> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
coherent story we can actually use the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.069 
coherent story we can actually use the
physical<00:03:43.700> model<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.150> that's<00:03:44.600> why<00:03:44.750> as<00:03:44.959> we

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
physical model to that that's why as we

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.569 
physical model to that that's why as we
go<00:03:45.230> through<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.620> typically<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.340> story

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
go through it typically the story

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.030 
go through it typically the story

emerges even when the topic has been
imposed<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:49.880> us<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:51.470> overcome<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:53.450> notion

imposed on us to overcome the notion
that<00:03:54.019> this<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.230> about<00:03:54.530> Lego<00:03:54.829> bricks<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:59.109> and

that this is about Lego bricks and and
and<00:04:00.590> dive<00:04:00.739> into<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:02.540> I<00:04:02.600> think<00:04:02.870> that's<00:04:02.989> why

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
and dive into it that I think that's why

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.160 
and dive into it that I think that's why
I<00:04:03.139> like<00:04:03.739> Denmark<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.400> necessary<00:04:04.970> an<00:04:05.239> easy

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
I like Denmark is necessary an easy

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.440 
I like Denmark is necessary an easy
market<00:04:06.530> Lego<00:04:07.310> isn't<00:04:07.819> necessarily<00:04:08.239> an<00:04:08.359> easy

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
market Lego isn't necessarily an easy

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.180 
market Lego isn't necessarily an easy
five<00:04:08.810> because<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.230> more<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.829> think<00:04:10.069> you

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
five because the more you you think you

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.490 
five because the more you you think you
know<00:04:10.340> what<00:04:10.519> this<00:04:10.639> is

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
know what this is

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.129 
know what this is
the<00:04:12.500> brakes<00:04:12.859> always<00:04:13.130> for<00:04:13.340> younger<00:04:14.030> children

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
the brakes always for younger children

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.020 
the brakes always for younger children
the<00:04:15.139> more<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.709> can<00:04:15.829> be<00:04:15.950> hard<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.459> make<00:04:16.910> the

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
the more it can be hard to make the

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.330 
the more it can be hard to make the
shift<00:04:17.329> into<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.049> works<00:04:18.260> but<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.100> think

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
shift into that it works but I think

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.490 
shift into that it works but I think
most<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:19.880> people<00:04:20.060> most<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.539> us<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:21.260> use<00:04:21.470> a

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
most of the people most of us that use a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.890 
most of the people most of us that use a
flipchart<00:04:21.859> marker<00:04:22.460> don't<00:04:22.940> think<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.330> think<00:04:23.840> of

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
flipchart marker don't think of think of

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.050 
flipchart marker don't think of think of
it<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.229> what<00:04:24.409> kids<00:04:24.650> use<00:04:24.890> to<00:04:25.070> make<00:04:25.190> drawings<00:04:25.520> but

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
it as what kids use to make drawings but

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.900 
it as what kids use to make drawings but
it's<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.360> same

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
it's the same

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.730 
it's the same
physical<00:04:27.420> tool<00:04:27.630> applied<00:04:28.230> in<00:04:28.410> different<00:04:28.650> ways

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
physical tool applied in different ways

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.380 
physical tool applied in different ways
so<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:28.950> think<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.700> think<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.270> other

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
so I think it's that I think the other

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.790 
so I think it's that I think the other
thing<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.630> can<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:31.020> tough<00:04:31.200> for<00:04:31.410> some

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
thing that can be tough for some

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.070 
thing that can be tough for some
companies<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.950> it's<00:04:34.950> really<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:36.080> an

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
companies is that it's really a an

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.200 
companies is that it's really a an
assumption<00:04:38.070> in<00:04:38.340> like<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.520> serious<00:04:38.880> play<00:04:39.000> that

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
assumption in like a serious play that

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.810 
assumption in like a serious play that
nobody<00:04:39.980> everybody<00:04:40.980> holds<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.400> part<00:04:41.640> of<00:04:41.730> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
nobody everybody holds a part of the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.050 
nobody everybody holds a part of the
answer<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.230> manager<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.830> boss<00:04:43.860> does<00:04:44.760> not

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
answer so the manager the boss does not

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.470 
answer so the manager the boss does not
know<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.480> answer<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:48.120> may<00:04:48.300> be<00:04:48.360> a

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
know the answer and that may be a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.700 
know the answer and that may be a
challenge<00:04:48.690> in<00:04:48.840> some<00:04:48.870> companies<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.530> we

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
challenge in some companies so we

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.500 
challenge in some companies so we
typically<00:04:50.160> talk<00:04:50.370> about<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.820> for<00:04:51.330> Lego

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
typically talk about that for Lego

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.870 
typically talk about that for Lego
series<00:04:51.630> played<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.320> be<00:04:52.440> successful<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.550> takes

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
series played to be successful it takes

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.320 
series played to be successful it takes
a<00:04:54.030> courageous<00:04:54.720> manager<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:56.030> a<00:04:57.030> complex

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
a courageous manager and a complex

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.540 
a courageous manager and a complex
problem<00:04:57.710> courageous<00:04:58.710> because<00:04:58.950> you're

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
problem courageous because you're

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.640 
problem courageous because you're
abusing<00:04:59.910> Lego<00:05:00.240> bricks<00:05:00.570> courageous<00:05:01.440> because

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
abusing Lego bricks courageous because

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.290 
abusing Lego bricks courageous because
you're<00:05:01.800> actually<00:05:01.980> opening<00:05:02.340> up<00:05:02.760> for<00:05:02.970> your

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
you're actually opening up for your

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.480 
you're actually opening up for your
employees<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.840> have<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.110> say<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:05.250> speak<00:05:05.460> the

employees to have a say and to speak the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.090 
employees to have a say and to speak the
truth<00:05:05.700> and<00:05:06.420> complex<00:05:07.290> because<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.560> works

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
truth and complex because it works

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.730 
truth and complex because it works
better<00:05:08.340> when<00:05:08.730> there's<00:05:08.970> no<00:05:09.120> obvious<00:05:09.810> solution

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
better when there's no obvious solution

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.800 
better when there's no obvious solution
because<00:05:11.520> Lego<00:05:11.820> bricks<00:05:12.030> really<00:05:12.480> work<00:05:12.660> well

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
because Lego bricks really work well

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.940 
because Lego bricks really work well
when<00:05:12.960> you<00:05:13.140> don't<00:05:13.350> know<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.950> answer<00:05:15.830> when<00:05:16.830> the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
when you don't know the answer when the

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.410 
when you don't know the answer when the
answer<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.250> kind<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.550> screaming<00:05:17.940> your<00:05:18.240> face

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
answer is kind of screaming your face

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.260 
answer is kind of screaming your face
and<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.690> kind<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:18.990> just<00:05:19.140> need<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.320> design<00:05:19.680> it

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
and you kind of just need to design it

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.940 
and you kind of just need to design it
then<00:05:21.270> you<00:05:21.390> know<00:05:21.600> you<00:05:22.230> might<00:05:22.380> not<00:05:22.500> use<00:05:22.770> many

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
then you know you might not use many

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.160 
then you know you might not use many
other<00:05:23.100> bands<00:05:23.400> but<00:05:23.790> this<00:05:23.910> is<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:24.720> is<00:05:24.930> good

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
other bands but this is this is good

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.660 
other bands but this is this is good
when<00:05:25.320> you<00:05:25.410> know<00:05:25.440> when<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.890> feel<00:05:26.100> like<00:05:26.250> oh<00:05:26.460> I

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
when you know when you feel like oh I

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.920 
when you know when you feel like oh I
don't<00:05:26.820> know<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.360> but<00:05:27.510> it'll<00:05:27.660> be<00:05:27.750> nice<00:05:27.900> to

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
don't know that but it'll be nice to

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.690 
don't know that but it'll be nice to
know<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.350> then<00:05:29.040> this<00:05:29.310> because<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:29.640> the

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
know it then this because of the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.980 
know it then this because of the
connection<00:05:30.000> was<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.210> was<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.540> brain<00:05:30.690> works

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
connection was it was the brain works

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.410 
connection was it was the brain works
really<00:05:31.110> well<00:05:31.320> in<00:05:31.680> my<00:05:32.190> experience<00:05:32.340> so<00:05:33.300> we

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
really well in my experience so we

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.760 
really well in my experience so we
deliberately<00:05:33.780> said<00:05:33.990> some<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.440> this<00:05:34.560> stuff

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
deliberately said some of this stuff

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.350 
deliberately said some of this stuff
you're<00:05:34.950> going<00:05:35.040> to<00:05:35.130> go<00:05:35.220> home<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.610> design<00:05:36.060> as<00:05:36.330> a

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
you're going to go home and design as a

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.510 
you're going to go home and design as a
consequence<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:38.120> what<00:05:39.120> we<00:05:39.270> go
